admission. the cervical microbiota was assessed  by 16s rrna gene sequencing by pyrosequencing. interleukin (il)-6 concentration in the cervical fluid and amniotic fluid was measured by elisa and

lactobacillus genus, five lactobacillus species, and three bv-related bacteria (gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, and prevotella bivia) together with escherichia coli and candida albicans in 426 african women across different groups at risk for hiv. we selected a reference group of adult hiv-negative women at average risk for hiv acquisition and compared species variations in subgroups of adolescents, hiv-negative pregnant women, women engaging in traditional vaginal practices, sex workers and a group of hiv-positive women on combination antiretroviral therapy. we explored the

habitats. it can be recovered from the gastrointestinal tract of animals and it is a common constituent of the vaginal microbiota of humans. moreover, l. crispatus can contribute to the urogenital health of the host through competitive exclusion and the production of antimicrobial agents. in order to investigate the genetic diversity of this important urogenital species, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of l. crispatus. results: utilizing the completed genome sequence of a strain st1 and the draft genome sequences of nine other l. crispatus isolates, we defined the scale and scope of the pan- and core genomic potential of l. crispatus. our comparative analysis identified 1,224 and 2,705 ortholog groups present in all or only some of the ten strains, respectively. based on mathematical modeling, sequencing of additional l. crispatus isolates would result in the identification of new genes and functions, whereas the conserved core of the ten strains was a good representation of the final l. crispatus core genome, estimated to level at  about 1,116 ortholog groups. importantly, the current core was observed to encode bacterial components potentially promoting urogenital health. using antibody fragments specific for one of the conserved l. crispatus adhesins, we demonstrated that the l. crispatus core proteins have a potential to reduce the ability of gardnerella vaginalis to adhere to epithelial cells. these findings thereby suggest that l. crispatus core proteins could protect the vagina from g.  vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis.

the differences and similarities between the genomes and identified features likely to be important for urogenital health. notably, the conserved genetic backbone of l. crispatus accounted for close

growth,  colonization, and community structure. the objective of this study was to assess  the stability of the vaginal microbiome of healthy canadian women throughout a menstrual cycle by using cpn60-based microbiota analysis. vaginal swabs from 27 naturally cycling reproductive-age women were collected weekly through a single menstrual cycle. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed to amplify the universal target region of the cpn60 gene and generate amplicons representative of the microbial community. amplicons were pyrosequenced, assembled into operational taxonomic units, and

results: overall, the vaginal microbiome of most women remained relatively stable throughout the menstrual cycle, with little variation in diversity and only modest fluctuations in species richness. microbiomes between women were more different than were those collected consecutively from individual women. clustering of microbial profiles revealed the expected groupings dominated by lactobacillus

disorder among women of reproductive age. the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis is poorly understood, but is defined by a transition in the vaginal flora from the predominant lactobacillus species

respond to bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria by triggering an innate immune response.  we observed that vaginal epithelial cells secreted interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in response to atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis, but not to lactobacillus crispatus. atopobium vaginae induced increased levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 transcripts, as well as increased transcripts for the antimicrobial peptide beta-defensin 4. this innate immune response required live bacteria capable of protein synthesis in direct contact with vaginal epithelial cells. the response of vaginal epithelial cells was mediated by toll-like receptor 2, required the adaptor protein myd88, and involved activation of the nfkappab signaling pathway. these results suggest that atopobium vaginae stimulates an innate immune response from vaginal epithelial cells, leading to localized cytokine and defensin production, and possibly contributes to the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.", "TI":
