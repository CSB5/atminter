developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections."}, {"TIHT": [], "PMID": "25480015", "TI": "comparative genomics of lactobacillus crispatus suggests novel mechanisms for the competitive exclusion of gardnerella vaginalis.", "ABHT": "1", "AB": "background: lactobacillus crispatus is a ubiquitous micro-organism encountered in a wide range of host-associated habitats. it can be recovered from the gastrointestinal tract of animals and it is a common constituent of the vaginal microbiota of humans. moreover, l. crispatus can contribute to the urogenital health of the host through competitive exclusion and the production of antimicrobial agents. in order to investigate the genetic diversity of this important urogenital species, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of l. crispatus. results: utilizing the completed genome sequence of a strain st1 and the draft genome sequences of nine other l. crispatus isolates, we defined the scale and scope of the pan- and core genomic potential of l. crispatus. our comparative analysis identified 1,224 and 2,705 ortholog groups present in all or only some of the ten strains, respectively. based on mathematical modeling, sequencing of additional l. crispatus isolates would result in the identification of new genes and functions, whereas the conserved core of the ten strains was a good representation of the final l. crispatus core genome, estimated to level at  about 1,116 ortholog groups. importantly, the current core was observed to encode bacterial components potentially promoting urogenital health. using antibody fragments specific for one of the conserved l. crispatus adhesins, we demonstrated that the l. crispatus core proteins have a potential to reduce the ability of gardnerella vaginalis to adhere to epithelial cells. these findings thereby suggest that l. crispatus core proteins could protect the vagina from g.  vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis. conclusions: our pan-genome analysis provides  insights into the intraspecific genome variability and the collective molecular mechanisms of the species l. crispatus. using this approach, we described the differences and similarities between the genomes and identified features likely to be important for urogenital health. notably, the conserved genetic backbone of l. crispatus accounted for close to 60% of the ortholog groups of an average l. crispatus strain and included factors for the competitive exclusion of g. vaginalis, providing an explanation on how this urogenital species could improve  vaginal health."}, {"TIHT": [], "PMID": "24805362", "TI": "lactobacillus crispatus dominant vaginal microbiome is associated with

non-pregnant healthy women were selected based on having high (>90% inhibition) or low (<20% inhibition) anti-e. coli activity. the v6 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene was amplified and sequenced

results: sixteen samples (10 with high and 6 with low activity) yielded evaluable microbiome data. there was no difference in the predominant microbiome species in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women (n = 8  each). however, there were significant differences between women with high compared to low e. coli inhibitory activity. high activity was associated with a  predominance of l. crispatus

was isolated  from a healthy woman (strain 5-1) and the other from a woman diagnosed with bv (strain 101), and vaginal lactobacilli on the adherence to cervical epithelial cells. in order to simulate the transition from vaginal health to bv, the lactobacilli were cultured with the epithelial cells first, and then the g. vaginalis strain was introduced. we quantified the inhibition of g. vaginalis adherence by the lactobacilli and displacement of adherent lactobacilli by g. vaginalis. our results confirmed that pathogenic g vaginalis 101 had a higher capacity for adhesion to the cervical epithelial cells than strain 5-1. interestingly, strain 101 displaced l. crispatus but not l. iners whereas strain  5-1 had less of an effect and did not affect the two species differently. furthermore, l. iners actually enhanced adhesion of strain 101 but not of strain  5-1. these results suggest that bv-causing g. vaginalis and l. iners do not interfere with one another, which may help to explain previous reports that women who are colonized with l. iners are more likely to develop bv."}, {"TIHT": [], "PMID": "23916636", "TI": "quantitative analysis of initial adhesion of bacterial

would need to be able to adhere to vaginal epithelium, even in the presence of vaginal lactobacilli. therefore, we quantified adherence of g. vaginalis and other bv-associated bacteria to an inert surface pre-coated with lactobacillus crispatus using a new peptide nucleic acid  (pna) fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) methodology. we found that g. vaginalis had the greatest capacity to adhere in the presence of l. crispatus. theoretically, an early colonizer would contribute to the adherence and/or growth of additional species, so we next quantified the effect of g. vaginalis biofilms  on the adherence and growth of other bv-associated species by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) technique. interestingly, g. vaginalis derived a growth benefit from the addition of a second species, regardless of the species.  conversely, g. vaginalis biofilms enhanced the growth of p. bivia, and to a minor extent of f. nucleatum. these results contribute to our understanding

vaginalis by lactobacillus strains isolated from women with or without bacterial vaginosis (bv), and to select one of the better lactobacillus producers of such a substance to be tested in vivo using a gnotobiotic animal model challenged with one of the more sensitive g. vaginalis isolates. a total of 24 isolates from women with and without bv were identified as g. vaginalis. a higher frequency (p<0.05) of this bacterium was observed in women with bv (56.7%) when compared to healthy women (17.6%). a total of 86 strains of lactobacillus were obtained from healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus strains were more frequently present (p<0.05) in healthy women  (97.5%) than in women with bv (76.7%). lactobacillus crispatus was the predominating strain in both healthy women and

assays were performed using as indicators 17 reference strains and the g. vaginalis strains isolated from women with bv and from healthy women.  lactobacillus isolated from healthy women showed the higher antagonistic activity against all the indicator strains when compared with isolates from women with bv. concerning the indicator strains, g. vaginalis found in women with bv was more resistant to the antagonism, particularly when lactobacillus isolates from women  with bv were used as producer strains. a high vaginal population level of g. vaginalis was obtained by intravaginal inoculation of germ-free mice, and this colonization was accompanied by vaginal histopathological lesions. a tenfold decrease in vaginal population level of g. vaginalis and a reduction of histological lesions were observed when the pathogenic challenge was performed in mice previously monoassociated with an l. johnsonii strain. concluding, results of the present study suggest that progression of g. vaginalis-associated bv depends in part on a simultaneous presence of lactobacillus populations with a low antagonistic capacity and of a g. vaginalis strain with a high resistance to  this antagonism. the results could also explain why g. vaginalis is frequently found in the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women."}, {"TIHT": [], "PMID": "22197267", "TI": "[bacterial vaginosis in 2011: a

mysterious, even if recent progress were accomplished in their comprehension: if  the flora implied in the bacterial vaginosis is recognized like polymorphic, it appears that gardnerella vaginalis plays a major part with two genomically different forms: a commensal form (slightly adhesive to the epithelial cells), and a pathogenic one (strongly adhesive to the epithelial cells); the changes in  lactobacilli are also to take into account: l. iners could be a marker of the vaginal flora imbalance whereas l. crispatus is generally met in the normal vaginal flora. these findings could influence the composition of coming probiotics; it is recognized that bacterial vaginosis is involved in the risk of  prematurity but molecular quantification of g. vaginalis (and of atopobium vaginae) is more sensitive for the diagnosis of bv what could improve the detection of high-risk pregnant women. the isolated antibiotic treatments are not very effective on the prevention of recurrences. the rebalancing of the vaginal flora is essential. in this field, the local estrogens showed some effectiveness. the use of probiotics is promising and can be recommended in complement of the antibiotic
