TI  == phylogenetic and metabolic diversity of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (rdx)-transforming bacteria in strictly anaerobic mixed cultures enriched on rdx  as nitrogen source.
AB  == five obligate anaerobes that were most closely related to clostridium bifermentans, clostridium celerecrescens, clostridium saccharolyticum, clostridium butyricum and desulfovibrio desulfuricans by their 16s rrna genes sequences were isolated from enrichment cultures using hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (rdx) as a nitrogen source. the above isolates transformed rdx at rates of 24.0, 5.4, 6.2, 2.5, 5.5 mumol h(-1) g (dry  weight) of cells(-1), respectively, to nitrite, formaldehyde, methanol, and nitrous oxide. the present results indicate that clostridia are major strains responsible for rdx removal, and all isolates seemed to mainly transform rdx via  its initial reduction to mnx and subsequent denitration. since clostridia are commonly present in soil, we suggest that they may contribute to the removal of rdx in the subsurface (anoxic) soil.

TI  == growth of a human intestinal desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.

TI  == biocontrol: bacillus penetrans and related parasites of nematodes.
AB  == bacillus penetrans mankau, 1975, previously described as duboscqia penetrans thorne 1940, is a candidate agent for biocontrol of nematodes. this review considers the life stages of this bacterium: vegetative growth phase, colony fragmentation, sporogenesis, soil phase, spore attachment, and penetration into larvae of root-knot nematodes. the morphology of the microthallus colonies and the unusual external features of the spore are discussed. taxonomic affinities with the actinomycetes, particularly with the genus pasteuria, are considered. also discussed are other soil bacterial species that are potential biocontrol agents. products of their bacterial fermentation in soil are toxic to nematodes,  making them effective biocontrol agents.
