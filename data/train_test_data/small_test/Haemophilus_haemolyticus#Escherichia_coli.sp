TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia and acute copd exacerbation in daily clinical practice: comparison to current guidelines.
AB  == background: the aim of this secondary analysis was to evaluate current microbiological approaches, microbiology, and antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease (aecopd) in clinical practice and to compare them with current  international guidelines. methods: a total of 362 patients with suspected cap were enrolled in 14 european centers in a prospective multicenter study. results: a total of 279 inpatients (cap, n = 222; aecopd, n = 57) were evaluated. a total  of 83 (37 %) cap patients and 25 (44 %) aecopd patients did not undergo any microbiological tests. in patients with cap/aecopd, blood culture was performed in 109 (49 %)/16 (28.1 %), urinary antigen tests for legionella pneumophila in 67 (30 %)/9 (16 %), and sputum investigation in 55 (25 %)/17 (30 %), respectively. the most frequent pathogens in cap were streptococcus pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, l. pneumophila, staphylococcus aureus, and enterobacter cloacae; in aecopd they were escherichia coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. all cap patients (mean = 11.1 days) and 35 (61.4 %) of aecopd patients (mean = 8.9 days) received  antibiotics. cap patients were given mostly aminopenicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors and aecopd patients were given mostly cephalosporins. conclusions: pathogens isolated in cap and aecopd and the antibiotic therapy used are in good  accordance with the guidelines. blood culture, recommended for all cap patients,  was performed in only 50 % of the cases and antibiotic therapy lasted longer than the suggested 5-7 days. therefore, international guidelines regarding performance of blood culture and duration of antibiotic therapy should be adopted more often. this duration was independent of the number of isolated pathogens and number of symptoms on admission. therefore, the question arises as to whether microbiological data are necessary only for patients who are resistant to initial therapy.

TI  == neonatal community-acquired pneumonia: pathogens and treatment.
AB  == aim: to analyse the bacterial pathogens and drug sensitivities for neonatal community-acquired pneumonia. methods: seven hundred sixty sputum samples from newborns with community-acquired pneumonia were cultured to determine microbial organisms present and their drug sensitivities. results: of the 760 specimens, 425 grew pathogens for a 55.9% positive rate. among the 425 positive cultures, 278 grew gram-negative organisms (65.4%), 142 grew gram-positive organisms (33.3%), while 5 grew fungus (1.3%). the most common gram-negative organisms were escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and hemophilus influenzae, while the most common gram-positive organisms were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus. to the gram-negative organisms, the  most sensitive drugs were meropenem, imipenem and amikacin, while to the gram-positive ones were vancomycin, teicoplanin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. conclusions: the most common causative bacteria were gram-negative organisms, which were highly sensitive to meropenem, imipenem and amikacin, yet often treatable with more focused antibiotic coverage, which depended on the bacterium  identified.

TI  == the binding of mbl to common bacteria in infectious diseases of children.
AB  == objective: to purify mannan-binding lectin (mbl) from human serum and detect its  binding ability to several kinds of bacteria common in infectious diseases of children. methods: mbl was purified from human serum by affinity chromatography on mannan-sepharose 4b column. its binding ability to eight species, 97 strains of bacteria was detected by enzyme-linked lectin assay (ella). results: mbl has different binding ability to bacteria and shows strong binding ability to klebsiella ornithinolytica and escherichia coli, but shows relatively lower binding ability to staphylococcus haemolyticus, enterobacter cloacae and staphylococcus epidermidis. to different isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and staphylococcus aureus, mbl shows quite different binding ability. conclusions: mbl has different binding ability to different bacteria, and has relatively stronger binding ability to gram-negative bacteria.  its binding ability to different isolates of certain kinds of bacteria is quite different.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

TI  == binding of human hemoglobin by haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == binding of biotinylated human hemoglobin to haemophilus influenzae was detected when organisms were grown in heme-deplete, but not heme-replete, conditions. hemoglobin binding was completely inhibited by a 100-fold excess of unlabelled human hemoglobin or human hemoglobin complexed with human haptoglobin. binding was only partially inhibited by rat hemoglobin, bovine hemoglobin, human globin,  and bovine globin, and not at all by heme, human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, human transferrin, or myoglobin. hemoglobin binding was saturable at 16-20 ng of hemoglobin per 10(9) cfu. binding of human hemoglobin was detected in serotypes a-f and serologically non-typable strains of h. influenzae, as well as  haemophilus haemolyticus but not haemophilus parainfluenzae, haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus parahaemolyticus, or escherichia coli.

TI  == clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  == a total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of  3 g/die by intramuscular route. pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject  (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. in vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to sa and 7 (16%) were resistant. at the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. in patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: e. coli in 40 cases, s. albus in 16 cases, proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, streptococcus faecalis in 3  cases, streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases.  in vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. at the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == cloning, sequencing, in vivo promoter mapping, and expression in escherichia coli of the gene for the hhai methyltransferase.
AB  == a 1476-base pair dna fragment from haemophilus haemolyticus containing the hhai methyltransferase gene was isolated from a cell library and cloned into pbr322. the nucleotide sequence of this fragment was determined. the structural gene is 981 nucleotides in length coding for a protein of 327 amino acids (mr 37,000). the translational start signal (atg) is preceded by the putative ribosome-binding site (taag). recombinant plasmids containing the 1476-basepair fragment are completely methylated when isolated from escherichia coli, as judged by their insusceptibility to the hhai restriction endonuclease. however, the presence of an active hhai methylase gene in certain e. coli strains results in a very poor yield of transformants and/or in vivo-originated deletions due to the rg1 functions of these hosts. the in vivo transcription initiation sites have been identified by s1 protection and primer-extension experiments using specific probes with total rna prepared from e. coli cells (hb101 or rr1) which tolerate the expression of mhhai.

TI  == the nucleotide sequence of is5 from escherichia coli.
AB  == a 3-kb fragment of haemophilus haemolyticus dna which carries the hhaii restriction (r) and modification (m) genes has been cloned into the psti site of  pbr322 (mann et al., 1978). when propagated in escherichia coli, it was observed  that spontaneous insertions of is5 inactivated the restriction gene, producing r- mutants at a frequency of 10(-6). electron microscopy, restriction-site mapping and sequence analysis of two r- plasmids have demonstrated the presence of is5 at a single target site in both possible orientations. the complete nucleotide sequence of is5 has been determined. it is 1195 bp long and has inverted terminal repeats of 16 bp. the target site for is5 in this plasmid is 5'-ctag. approx. ten copies of is5 were found to be present at about the same locations on the e. coli chromosome in various k-12 strains, using southern hybridization analysis.

TI  == [ampicillin-resistant "haemophilus": their detection and occurrence in brussels area (author's transl)].
AB  == three hundred and five strains of haemophilus (129 h. influenzae, 55 h. parainfluenzae, 97 h. parahaemolyticus, 5 h. haemolyticus, 10 h. paraphrophilus and 9 h. paraphrohaemolyticus) isolated from pathological material over the year  1976, were systematically tested for beta-lactamase production. only 2 strains of h. parainfluenzae produced this enzyme. both were able to transfer ampicillin resistance to escherichia coli k12. all strains but the two beta-lactamase producers were susceptible to penicillin g, ampicillin and cephalotin. however, the correct interpretation of the susceptibility tests needed the microscopic observation of prints of the inhibition zones surrounding the disks: all sensitive strains presented a hazy growth around the disks which corresponded to  the presence of spheroplasts; this phenomenon was not observed with the 2 beta-lactamase producing strains of h. parainfluenzae which grew up to the disks  but presented a typical bacillary form.

TI  == cloning of restriction and modification genes in e. coli: the hbaii system from haemophilus haemolyticus.
AB  == the genes for a class ii restriction-modification system (hhaii) from haemophilus haemolyticus have been cloned in escherichia coli. the vector used for cloning was plasmid pbr322 which confers resistance to tetracycline and ampicillin and contains a single endonuclease r-psti site, (formula: see text), in the ampicillin gene. the procedure developed by bolivar et al. (1977) was used to form dna recombinants. h. haemolyticus dna was cleaved with psti endonuclease and poly(dc) extensions were added to the 3'-oh termini using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. circular pbr322 dna was cleaved to linear molecules with psti endonuclease and poly(dg) extensions were added to the 3'-oh termini, thus regenerating the psti cleavage site sequences. recombinant molecules, formed by annealing the two dnas, were used to transfect a restriction and modification-deficient strain of e. coli (hb101 r-m-reca). tetracycline-resistant clones were tested for acquisition of restriction phenotype (as measured by growth on plates seeded with phage lambdaci-0). a single phage-resistant clone was found. the recombinant plasmid, pd110, isolated from this clone, had acquired 3 kilobases of additional dna which could be excised with psti endonuclease. in addition to the restriction function, cells carrying the plasmid expressed the hhaii modification function. both activities have been partially purified by single-stranded dna-agarose chromatography. the cloned hhaii restriction activity yields cleavage patterns identical to hinfi. a restriction map of the cloned dna  segment is presented.

TI  == bactericidal factor produced by haemophilus influenzae b: partial purification of the factor and transfer of its genetic determinant.
AB  == when aerobically grown on complex media, haemophilus influenzae b and unencapsulated variants, rb strains, produced a bactericidal factor that was active against other haemophilus species and certain genera of the enterobacteriaceae. a total of 341 clinical isolates of haemophilus were tested for susceptibility to the factor. ninety-three percent of h. influenzae (nontypable), 75% of h. haemolyticus, 71% of h. parainfluenzae, and 22% of h. parahaemolyticus were susceptible. h. influenaze b strains were resistant producers of the bactericidal factor and h. influenzae f strains were susceptible nonproducers. only one strain each of h. aegyptius and h. aphrophilus was isolated and each was susceptible and resistant, respectively. 143 clinical isolates of the enterobacteriaceae were tested and of those 82% of escherichia coli, 85% of salmonella sp., and all citrobacter sp., shigella sp., and yersinia  sp. were sensitive to the bactericidal factor produced by h. influenzae b. attempts to isolate the bactericidal activity from mechanically disrupted, solubilized, or osmotically shocked cells failed to release active bactericidal factor. however, we partially purified the bactericidal factor from the spent culture medium of aerobically grown h. influenzae b by a series of extractions. the ability to produce the bactericidal factor was transferable to nonproducer strains without also genetically transforming for type b encapsulation. the converse was also true in that type b capsules were produced by transformed h. influenzae rd strains but no bactericidal factor was detected from these strains. additionally, nitrosoguanidine-induced mutants of h. influenzae b lost the ability to produce bactericidal factor without loss of their type-specific capsule, demonstrating that production of the bactericidal factor was genetically separable from production of the type capsule of h. influenzae b.
