TI  == bacteria recovered from dental pulp induce apoptosis of lymph node cells.
AB  == apoptosis is critical in the pathogenesis of several infectious diseases. the induction of apoptosis was assessed in mouse lymph node cells by four bacteria recovered from infected human dental pulp: gemella morbillorum, clostridium butyricum, fusobacterium nucleatum and bifidobacterium adolescentis. smaller lymph nodes and smaller numbers of cells were observed after experimental dental  pulp infection with c. butyricum, suggesting that this bacterium induces cell death. apoptosis was evaluated by determination of cell ploidy and detection of dna degradation in cells cultured with killed bacteria. paraformaldehyde-killed c. butyricum and heat-killed g. morbillorum induced substantial cell death, while f. nucleatum and b. adolescentis induced cell death at lower levels. no bacterial preparations induced apoptosis in cells from mice genetically deficient for tumour necrosis factor receptor p55 (tnfrp55), implicating this receptor directly or indirectly as a mediator in the process. it was concluded that apoptosis may be induced during periapical lesions of pulpal origin.

TI  == cytokine production in response to endodontic infection in germ-free mice.
AB  == this study evaluated the cytokine profiles (type 1 or type 2) that are triggered  by and modulate endodontic periapical infections in the root canal system of germ-free mice. microorganisms isolated from two patients with pulpal necrosis were inoculated into two groups of experimental animals: group i (gemella morbillorum) and group ii (bifidobacterium adolescentis, fusobacterium nucleatum  and clostridium butyricum). in vitro, g. morbillorum induced type 1 cytokine synthesis, while the modulation processed in vivo seemed to have the opposite effect, with a reduction in the basal levels of il-12 and ifn-gamma, il-4-independent down-modulation. in vitro, microorganisms from group ii, in poly-infection, induced a reduction of type 1 cytokine levels from day 10 to day  20, which seemed to be modulated via il-4. in vivo, however, a predominance of the immune response to one species over the others occurred.

TI  == implantation of bacteria from human pulpal necrosis and translocation from root canals in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine whether microorganisms recovered from infected human root canals were able to survive and translocate to a local lymph  node when experimentally inoculated into the root canal system of germ-free mice. the microorganisms isolated from two patients with pulpal necrosis were inoculated in two groups of experimental animals; group i (gemella morbillorum) and group ii (bifidobacterium adolescentis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and clostridium butyricum). g. morbillorum showed the highest frequency of colonization and translocation to the draining lymph node. in group ii only f. nucleatum and c. butyricum colonized and translocated when inoculated in tri-association. when the bacteria from group ii were inoculated in monoinfection all three species colonized the root canal of germ-free mice and translocated to  the draining lymph node, but with different frequencies. we conclude that selective mechanisms occur in which some bacterial species are fit to survive, multiply, and translocate in the germ-free mouse model.
