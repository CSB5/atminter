TI  == butyrivibrio hungatei sp. nov. and pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans sp. nov., butyrate-producing bacteria from the rumen.
AB  == two novel gram-negative, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, butyrate-producing bacterial species, strains mz 5t and jk 615t, were isolated from the rumen fluid  of cow and sheep. both strains were curved rods that were motile by means of single polar or subpolar flagellum and common in the rumen microbial ecosystem. strain mz 5t produced high xylanase, proteinase, pectin hydrolase and dnase activities; 1,4-beta-endoglucanase was also detected in the culture medium. the bacterium utilized a wide range of carbohydrates. glucose was fermented to formate, butyrate, lactate, succinate and ethanol. the dna g + c content was 42.1 mol%. the complete 16s rdna sequence was obtained and phylogenetic relationships  were determined. strain mz 5t and related isolates were located in clostridial cluster xiva and were closely related to pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, butyrivibrio crossotus, roseburia cecicola and eubacterium rectale. the name proposed for this novel bacterium is pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans; the type strain is mz 5t (=dsm 14809t =atcc baa-455t). strain jk 615t produced no fibrolytic activity, but utilized a wide range of carbohydrates. glucose was fermented to formate, acetate, butyrate and ethanol. the dna g + c content was 44-8 mol%. the complete  16s rdna sequence was obtained and phylogenetic relationships were determined. strain jk 615t was located in clostridial cluster xiva and was closely related to clostridium proteoclasticum, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and eubacterium halii. the name proposed for this novel bacterium is butyrivibrio hungatei; the type strain  is jk 615t (=dsm 14810t =atcc baa-456t).

TI  == isolation and characterization of a bacteriocin (butyrivibriocin ar10) from the ruminal anaerobe butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ar10: evidence in support of the widespread occurrence of bacteriocin-like activity among ruminal isolates of b. fibrisolvens.
AB  == forty-nine isolates of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and a single isolate of butyrivibrio crossotus were screened for the production of inhibitors by a deferred plating procedure. twenty-five isolates produced factors which, to various degrees, inhibited the growth of the other butyrivibrio isolates. none of the inhibitory activity was due to bacteriophages. the inhibitory products from 18 of the producing strains were sensitive to protease digestion. differences in  the ranges of activity among the butyrivibrio isolates and protease sensitivity profiles suggest that a number of different inhibitory compounds are produced. these findings suggest that the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitors may be  a widespread characteristic throughout the genus butyrivibrio. the bacteriocin-like activity from one isolate, b. fibrisolvens ar10, was purified and confirmed to reside in a single peptide. crude bacteriocin extracts were prepared by ammonium sulfate and methanol precipitation of spent culture supernatants, followed by dialysis and high-speed centrifugation. the active component was isolated from the semicrude extract by reverse-phase chromatography. tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed that the peptide was purified to homogeneity, having an estimated molecular mass of approximately 4,000 da. the n terminus of the peptide was blocked. a cyanogen bromide cleavage fragment of the native peptide yielded a sequence of 20 amino acids [(m)giqlapaxyqdivnxvaag]. no homology with previously  reported bacteriocins was found. butyrivibriocin ar10 represents the first bacteriocin isolated from a ruminal anaerobe.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of butyrivibrio strains reveals three distinct groups of species within the clostridium subphylum of the gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the phylogenetic positions of 40 butyrivibrio strains were determined by performing a comparative sequence analysis of the 16s rrna genes of these organisms. we found that all of the strains which we studied belong to cluster xiva (m. d. collins, p. a. lawson, a. willems, j. j. cordoba, j. fernandez=garayzabal, p. garcia, j. cai, h. hippe, and j. a. e. farrow, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 44:812-826, 1994) of the clostridium subphylum of the gram-positive bacteria, which also includes several clostridium, coprococcus, eubacterium, and ruminococcus species. we also found that the butyrivibrio strains which we examined were genotypically heterogeneous and exhibited 12 distinct rrna sequence types. the 12 rrna sequence types formed three distinct lineages in cluster xiva, which were separate from each other and from all other  species belonging to this cluster. one lineage consisted of strains which exhibited a single rrna type and corresponded to the species butyrivibrio crossotus. the second lineage consisted of 12 strains designated butyrivibrio fibrisolvens which exhibited seven distinct rrna sequence types. the type strain  of b. fibrisolvens was a member of this lineage, but its position was peripheral. the third lineage comprised 26 b. fibrisolvens strains which exhibited four distinct rrna sequence types. tree topology and sequence divergence considerations indicated that the three lineages correspond to three separate genera and that the genus butyrivibrio should be restricted to the group that contains the type strain of b. fibrisolvens.
