TI  == repurposing salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs to combat drug resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the us. repurposing food and drug administration (fda) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. the fda approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic):  0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). the two drugs were also effective against another gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecium (mic 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant s. aureus clinical isolates, with mics at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. a time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. oxyclozanide was non-toxic to hepg2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro mics but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. these data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  == ac-gf(a6c)g(a6c)k(a6c)g(a6c)f(a6c)g(a6c)gk(a6c)kkkk-amide (a6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (amp) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43mum. spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this  amp interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. cd and 2d-(1)h nmr experiments indicated this amp  on binding to sds and dpc micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages  of helical and random coil conformers. cd investigations in the presence of three phospholipid suvs consisting of popc, 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc revealed: (1) the interactions occurring with popc suvs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the amp yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) the interactions with 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc suvs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the cd spectra. (3) the presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of suvs as was the case with micelles. this data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this amp are very different from the diversity of  conformations adopted by this amp on insertion into the lipid bilayer. cd spectra of this amp in the presence of suvs consisting of lps isolated from p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.

TI  == four carbapenem-resistant gram-negative species carrying distinct carbapenemases  in a single patient.
AB  == carbapenem-resistant escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and acinetobacter baumannii were isolated from a single patient, each  producing different carbapenemases (ndm-1, kpc-2, imp, and oxa-23, respectively). the ndm-1-producing e. coli strain was preceded by a clonally related carbapenem-susceptible strain a month earlier, suggesting in vivo acquisition of  blandm-1.

TI  == activity of eravacycline against enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii,  including multidrug-resistant isolates, from new york city.
AB  == eravacycline demonstrated in vitro activity against a contemporary collection of  more than 4,000 gram-negative pathogens from new york city hospitals, with mic50/mic90 values, respectively, for escherichia coli of 0.12/0.5 mug/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae of 0.25/1 mug/ml, enterobacter aerogenes of 0.25/1 mug/ml,  enterobacter cloacae 0.5/1 mug/ml, and acinetobacter baumannii of 0.5/1 mug/ml. activity was retained against multidrug-resistant isolates, including those expressing kpc and oxa carbapenemases. for a. baumannii, eravacycline mics correlated with increased expression of the adeb gene.

TI  == production of humic substances through coal-solubilizing bacteria.
AB  == in this paper, the production of humic substances (hs) through the bacterial solubilization of low rank coal (lrc) was evaluated. the evaluation was carried out by 19 bacterial strains isolated in microenvironments with high contents of coal wastes. the biotransformed lrc and the hs produced were quantified in vitro  in a liquid growth medium. the humic acids (ha) obtained from the most active bacterial strain were characterized via elemental composition (c, h, n, o), ir analyses, and the e4/e6 ratio; they were then compared with the ha extracted chemically using naoh. there was lrc biotransformation ranged from 25 to 37%, and hs production ranged from 127 to 3100 mg . l(-1). more activity was detected in the isolated strains of bacillus mycoides, microbacterium sp, acinetobacter sp, and enterobacter aerogenes. the ha produced by b. mycoides had an ir spectrum and an e4/e6 ratio similar to those of the ha extracted with naoh, but their elemental composition and their degree of aromatic condensation was different. results suggest that these bacteria can be used to exploit the lrc resulting from coal mining activities and thus produce hs in order to improve the content of humified organic matter in soils.

TI  == chemical composition and antibacterial activity of lavandula coronopifolia essential oil against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the composition of the essential oil (eo) of lavandula coronopifolia from morocco and to evaluate its in vitro antibacterial activity against antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from clinical infections. the antimicrobial activity was assessed by a broth micro-well dilution method using multiresistant clinical isolates of 11 pathogenic bacteria: klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, klebsiella ornithinolytica, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, providencia rettgeri, citrobacter freundii, hafnia alvei, salmonella spp., acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the main compounds of the oil were carvacrol (48.9%), e-caryophyllene (10.8%) and caryophyllene oxide (7.7%). the oil showed activity against all tested strains with minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranging between 1% and 4%. for most of the strains, the mic value was equivalent to the minimal bactericidal concentration value, indicating a clear bactericidal effect of l. coronopifolia eo.

TI  == persistence of nosocomial bacteria on 2 biocidal fabrics based on silver under conditions of high relative humidity.
AB  == background: the survival of pathogenic microorganism on fabrics in the health care environment has a important role in nosocomial infections. the use of biocidal fabrics and surfaces could reduce the prevalence of the microorganisms in the hospital environment. methods: in this study, the persistence of nosocomial bacteria on 2 fabrics containing biocidal fibers (bf) in the long term following desiccation and subsequent storage was examined at 40% and 90% relative humidity (rh). results: very few strains survived more than 7 days at 40% rh on fabrics containing 67% bf, and only strains of acinetobacter baumanii and pseudomonas aeruginosa survived on fabric containing 100% bf. none of the strains tested survived 14 days on the 2 fabrics, 67% or 100% bf, under these environmental conditions. in contrast, at higher rh ( approximately 90%), most of the strains tested showed prolonged survival on both fabrics, and all strains of  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and a baumannii survived for more  than 14 days; however, in a petri dish, most of the microorganisms tested showed  a higher survival even at 28 days. the gram-positive cocci and a baumannii were the most persistent bacteria on the petri dish. conclusions: this study emphasizes the effect of rh on the survival of nosocomial bacteria on 2 commercially available fabrics containing biocide. evidence of the clinical efficacy of these bf-containing fabrics is lacking.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  == objectives: to screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). methods: bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity  tests by the kirby-bauer's disc diffusion method. the antibacterial potentiality  of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains of nine uropathogens. results: two gram-positive isolates, e. faecalis and s. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. gram-negative isolates a. baumannii, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. methanolic leaf extracts of anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against s. aureus and 28 mm against e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa. cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for e. faecalis, e. aerogenes, and p. aeruginosa. based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: c. tora >  a. acuminata > schleichera oleosa > pterocarpus santalinus > eugenia jambolana >  bridelia retusa > mimusops elengi > stereospermum kunthianum > tectona grandis >  anthocephalus cadamba. the following eight plants had moderate control capacity:  artocarpus heterophyllus, azadirachta indica, dalbergia latifolia, eucalyptus citriodora, gmelina arborea, pongamia pinnata, pterocarpus marsupium, and shorea  robusta. e. coli, followed by a. baumannii, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. conclusions: a majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against mdr uropathogenic bacteria.

TI  == synthesis, optimization, and characterization of silver nanoparticles from acinetobacter calcoaceticus and their enhanced antibacterial activity when combined with antibiotics.
AB  == background: the development of nontoxic methods of synthesizing nanoparticles is  a major step in nanotechnology to allow their application in nanomedicine. the present study aims to biosynthesize silver nanoparticles (agnps) using a cell-free extract of acinetobacter spp. and evaluate their antibacterial activity. methods: eighteen strains of acinetobacter were screened for agnp synthesis. agnps were characterized using various techniques. reaction parameters were optimized, and their effect on the morphology of agnps was studied. the synergistic potential of agnps on 14 antibiotics against seven pathogens was determined by disc-diffusion, broth-microdilution, and minimum bactericidal concentration assays. the efficacy of agnps was evaluated as per the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints of the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines. results: only a. calcoaceticus lrvp54 produced agnps within 24 hours. monodisperse spherical nanoparticles of 8-12 nm were obtained with 0.7 mm silver nitrate at 70 degrees c. during optimization, a  blue-shift in ultraviolet-visible spectra was seen. x-ray diffraction data and lattice fringes (d =0.23 nm) observed under high-resolution transmission electron microscope confirmed the crystallinity of agnps. these agnps were found to be more effective against gram-negative compared with gram-positive microorganisms.  overall, agnps showed the highest synergy with vancomycin in the disc-diffusion assay. for enterobacter aerogenes, a 3.8-fold increase in inhibition zone area was observed after the addition of agnps with vancomycin. reduction in mic and minimum bactericidal concentration was observed on exposure of agnps with antibiotics. interestingly, multidrug-resistant a. baumannii was highly sensitized in the presence of agnps and became susceptible to antibiotics except  cephalosporins. similarly, the vancomycin-resistant strain of streptococcus mutans was also found to be susceptible to antibiotic treatment when agnps were added. these biogenic agnps showed significant synergistic activity on the beta-lactam class of antibiotics. conclusion: this is the first report of synthesis of agnps using a. calcoaceticus lrvp54 and their significant synergistic activity with antibiotics resulting in increased susceptibility of multidrug-resistant bacteria evaluated as per mic breakpoints of the clsi standard.

TI  == [the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia in newborn and the changes of isolated pathogens].
AB  == objective: to study the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) in  newborn and the profiles of isolated pathogens. methods: the clinical data of 179 neonates in the previous group (from december 2005 to december 2008) and 331 neonates in the present group (from january 2009 to january 2012) admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) and received mechanical ventilation for equal or longer than 48 hours were respectively reviewed and analyzed,and their isolated pathogen profile and drug sensitivity were also compared in two groups.  results: the incidence of vap in the previous group and the present group were 22.35% and 20.24% respectively, no significant difference between two groups (p > 0.05) was observed. gram-negative bacteria was the main pathogens (93.40%), the first 5 common pathogens in the previous group were klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes. however, the first 5 of isolated gram-negative pathogens  in the present group were somewhat different from the previous group, which were  klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes. the drug sensitivity test showed that these pathogens had a general decline in sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics, of which the carbapenem antibiotic drug sensitivity decreased significantly, there was statistically significant difference between the previous group and the present group (p < 0.05). the risk factors of vap include the duration of mechanical ventilation (or = 5.680, 95% ci: 2.867-11.253), the frequency of tracheal intubation (or = 2.219, 95% ci: 1.037- 4.748), birth weight (or = 2. 127, 95% ci: 1.067-4.238) and neonatal asphyxia (or = 2.025, 95% ci: 1.079-3.799) as well as the duration of hospital stay (or = 2.012, 95% ci: 1.215-3.967). conclusions: according to the data in our hospital, the main pathogenic bacteria  of vap were gram-negative pathogens, which showed a general decline in sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics. the incidence of vap was closely related to the duration of mechanical ventilation, the frequency of intubation, birth weight and the hospitalization as well as the neonatal asphyxia.

TI  == [investigation of the presence of new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) by pcr in carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates].
AB  == bacteria producing new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. this broad-spectrum resistance  limits treatment options for infections caused by ndm-1 producers. ndm-1 was first isolated from an indian patient in sweden; since then, ndm-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including turkey. in this study,  we investigated the presence of ndm-1 by pcr method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in samsun,  turkey. a total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 acinetobacter baumannii, 54 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 pseudomonas putida, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 3 enterobacter aerogenes, 3 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia rettgeri, 2 escherichia coli and 1 citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using vitek-2 compact (biomerieux, france) and bd  phoenix (bd diagnostic systems, md) automated systems. the results of antibiotic  susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the clsi recommendations. in our study, ndm-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by pcr. there was only one case study that reported the presence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates from turkey [poirel l et al. antimicrob agents chemother 2012;56:2784].  our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates is not common in turkey. however, since ndm-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. therefore, continuous surveillance  and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of ndm-1 may enable to identify ndm-1 producing isolates. meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of ndm-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.

TI  == surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in indian.
AB  == objective: to record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. methods: urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (uti)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by kirby-bauer's disc  diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. results: from wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during april 2011 to september 2012. two gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), and nine gram-negative bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter sp., escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. both s. aureus and e. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. particularly, all gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for uti. conclusions: antibiograms of 11 uti-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus. moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis is a matter of concern.

TI  == comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: india.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. materials and methods: seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating  isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of salmonella typhi and candida  albicans. reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. a very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. results: the highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by  desnet (5.05) and bacillocid special (5.02). a comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for lysol, bacillocid sp. and desnet, respectively. in the discard jars, bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, desnet for 3 days and hi-giene germitol for 1 day. the remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on day 1. phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like desnet and bacillocid special. conclusions: newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  == background: statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. in this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). results: it was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (vse), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to  rosuvastatin. on the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. conclusion: our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.

TI  == genetic characterization of an extended-spectrum ampc cephalosporinase with hydrolysing activity against fourth-generation cephalosporins in a clinical isolate of enterobacter aerogenes selected in vivo.
AB  == background: extended-spectrum ampc cephalosporinases (esacs) have been reported in enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. here,  we characterize a new ampc variant presenting a broadened substrate activity towards fourth-generation cephalosporins, selected in vivo following cefepime treatment for enterobacter aerogenes. methods: two consecutive clonally related isolates of e. aerogenes were evaluated. screening for esac production was performed using plates containing 200 mg/l cloxacillin. mics were determined by microdilution (clsi guidelines). bla(ampc) genes were cloned into a pcr-blunt ii-topo vector and expressed in escherichia coli. the ampc genes were cloned into vector pgex-6p-1 for protein purification. results: isolate ea595 was resistant to two fourth-generation cephalosporins, cefepime and cefpirome; using plates containing cloxacillin, susceptibility to ceftazidime and cefepime was restored,  suggesting overproduction of the esac beta-lactamase. sequencing identified a new ampc beta-lactamase variant presenting one amino acid substitution, val291gly, inside the h-10 helix. recombinant plasmids harbouring this esac beta-lactamase conferred a broadened resistance profile to cefepime and cefpirome, with resistance levels increasing from 16- to 32-fold in e. coli. ampc-ea595 hydrolysed ceftazidime, cefepime and cefpirome at high levels, presenting a lower k(m) and enabling us to classify the enzyme as an esac. homology modelling suggested that the size of the active site could have increased. conclusions: we  characterized an esac beta-lactamase selected in vivo and conferring a high level of resistance to fourth-generation cephalosporins in e. aerogenes. the broadened  spectrum was caused by a new modification to the h-10 helix, which modified the active site.

TI  == high-dose ciprofloxacin for serious gram-negative infection in an obese, critically ill patient receiving continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration.
AB  == objective: to describe the pharmacokinetic profile and clinical outcome associated with high-dose ciprofloxacin therapy in a patient with the triad of extreme obesity, multiple organ failure, and deep-seated infection. case summary: a 45-year-old, class 3 obese (185 kg; body mass index 53.7), critically ill trauma patient receiving continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (cvvhdf) was treated with ciprofloxacin 800 mg intravenously every 12 hours for presumed enterobacter aerogenes (ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] </=1 mug/ml) lumbar spine osteomyelitis. four sequential plasma ciprofloxacin samples  were obtained and analyzed to determine the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile. the observed steady-state maximum (c(max)) and calculated minimum (c(min)) ciprofloxacin plasma concentrations measured on treatment day 8 were 13 mug/ml and 4.8 mug/ml, respectively, corresponding to an estimated half-life, area under the curve (auc(0-24)), total systemic clearance, and clearance by cvvhdf of 7.6 hours, 192 mug.h/ml, 139 ml/min, and 26 ml/min, respectively. these concentrations produced auc(0-24)/mic ratios >125 and plasma c(max)/mic ratios >10 for mics </=1 mug/ml. intravenous colistin and polymyxin b lumbar wound irrigation were initiated on ciprofloxacin days 12 and 15, respectively, for concomitant multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii infection. lumbar tissue  cultures on day 24 of ciprofloxacin therapy demonstrated no growth, coinciding with overall improvement of the invasive wound. a week later, the patient developed worsening septic shock and died secondary to an occult subdiaphragmatic abscess. discussion: pharmacodynamic outcome studies suggest that auc(0-24)/mic ratios >125 and plasma c(max)/mic ratios >10 are good predictors of clinical and  microbiologic success of ciprofloxacin against gram-negative pathogens. these pharmacodynamic goals were achieved in the plasma with high-dose ciprofloxacin for mics </=1 mug/ml. conclusions: critically ill obese patients with deep-seated infection involving organisms with mics >0.5 mug/ml likely require ciprofloxacin  dosages greater than traditional daily doses of 400-800 mg during cvvhdf to achieve optimal pharmacodynamic targets.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  == background: in effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. methodology: the antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 35218, enterobacter aerogenes atcc 29751, e. aerogenes atcc 13048, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 and enterococcus hirae atcc 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. results: the crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). the most active plant extracts were  from dortenia picta and bridelia micrantha (mic: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from b. micrantha, mallotus oppositifolius, garcinia lucida, garcinia. kola, campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and c. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-positive cocci (mic: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). conclusion: of the 17 plant extracts studied,  seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. the stem bark of b. micrantha and the leaves of d. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli. this study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.

TI  == carbapenemases: molecular diversity and clinical consequences.
AB  == carbapenemases are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze most beta-lactams including carbapenems. carbapenemases are classified in four molecular classes; those belonging to class a are the chromosomally-encoded and clavulanic acid-inhibited  imi, nmc-a and sme, identified in enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens; the plasmid-encoded kpc enzymes identified in enterobacteriaceae (and rarely in pseudomonas aeruginosa); and the ges-type enzymes identified in enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa. the class b enzymes are the most clinically-significant carbapenemases; they are metallo-beta-lactamases, mostly of the imp and the vim series. they have been reported worldwide and their genes  are plasmid- and integron-located, hydrolyzing all beta-lactams with the exception of aztreonam. one single plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase, cmy-10,  identified in an enterobacter aerogenes isolate, has been shown to be a cephaslosporinase with some carbapenemase properties. finally, the class d carbapenemases are being increasingly reported, mostly in acinetobacter baumannii, and they compromise the efficacy of imipenem and meropenem significantly.

TI  == incidence of class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in champagne-ardenne (france): a 1 year prospective study.
AB  == objectives: to assess the frequency and diversity of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in the champagne-ardenne region france, and to identify genetic elements associated with the bla(ctx-m) genes. methods: during 2004, all  the non-duplicate isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii  resistant to ceftazidime and of enterobacteriaceae intermediate or resistant to ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime, screening samples excluded, were collected in 10 public hospitals and 3 private clinics. bla genes were sequenced and bla(ctx-m) environment characterized by pcr mapping. results: in enterobacteriaceae (138/21  861; 0.6%), esbls were predominantly tem-24 (n = 52; 37.7%) and ctx-m-15 (n = 37; 26.8%). three new enzymes were identified, ctx-m-61 (ctx-m-1 group), tem- and shv-type. a. baumannii (n = 5) produced veb-1 and p. aeruginosa (n = 2) shv-2a. isecp1 was detected in 22/27 strains, disrupted in 7 of them. the is903-like element was downstream of bla(ctx-m-14) and bla(ctx-m-16). iscr1 was found upstream of bla(ctx-m-2) and bla(ctx-m-9), and iscr1 and bla(ctx-m-2) were located on a sul1-type class 1 integron. in comparison with 2001-02, esbl distribution among enterobacteriaceae showed an increase in ctx-m-type (44.9% vs  3.7% p < 10(-7)) due to escherichia coli ctx-m-15 and to the almost total disappearance of tem-3 (0.9% vs 51.2%). e. coli was the most frequent species (50.0% vs 5.1% in 1998) despite a similar prevalence to that in 1998 (0.5% vs 0.2%). conclusions: a careful detection of bla(ctx-m)-type spread to other species would help to anticipate clonal endemics such as those observed in enterobacter aerogenes tem-24.

TI  == frequency and predictors of colonization of the respiratory tract by vim-2-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients of a newly established intensive care unit.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the frequency and predictors of colonization of the respiratory tract by metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing gram-negative  bacteria in patients admitted to a newly established intensive care unit (icu) of a tertiary care hospital. specimens of tracheobronchial aspirates for microbiological studies were obtained every day for the first 3 days of the icu stay and subsequently every third day for the rest of the icu stay. pcr analysis  and nucleotide sequencing were performed to identify bacteria that had mbl genes. thirty-five patients (20 male, 15 female) were hospitalized during the initial 3  month period of functioning of the icu. colonization of the lower respiratory tract by gram-negative bacteria was found in 29 of 35 patients (83 %) during the  first 6-20 days (median 13 days) following admission to the icu (13 patients with acinetobacter baumannii, ten with pseudomonas aeruginosa, three with enterobacter aerogenes, two with klebsiella pneumoniae and one with stenotrophomonas maltophilia). six of 29 patients (21 %) colonized with gram-negative bacteria had bla(vim-2)-positive p. aeruginosa isolates; one of these patients developed clinical infection due to this micro-organism. previous use of carbapenems (p=0.01) or other beta-lactams (p=0.03), as well as a stay in the icu of >20 days (p<0.001), were associated with colonization with bla(vim-2)-producing p. aeruginosa. in conclusion, colonization by gram-negative bacteria of the respiratory tract of patients in this newly established icu was common (83 %). use of beta-lactams, including carbapenems, was associated with subsequent colonization of the respiratory tract with mbl-positive p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == antiseptic impregnated endotracheal tubes for the prevention of bacterial colonization.
AB  == the effect of endotracheal tubes (etts) impregnated with chlorhexidine (chx) and  silver carbonate (antiseptic etts) against staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterobacter aerogenes [organisms associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap)], was evaluated in a laboratory airway model. antiseptic etts and control etts (unimpregnated) were inserted in culture  tubes half-filled with agar media (airway model) previously contaminated at the surface with 10(8) cfu/ml of the selected test organism. after five days of incubation, bacterial colony counts on all ett segments were determined. swabs of proximal and distal ends of the agar tract in antiseptic and control models were  subcultured. the initial and residual chx levels, (five days post-implantation in the model) were determined. cultures of antiseptic etts revealed colonization by  the tested pathogens ranging from 1-100 cfu/tube, compared with approximately 10(6) cfu/tube for the control etts (p < 0.001). subcultures from proximal and distal ends of the agar tract showed minimal or no growth in the antiseptic etts  compared with the control etts (p < 0.001). the amount of chx retained in the antiseptic etts after five days of implantation was an average of 45% of the initial level. antiseptic etts prevented bacterial colonization in the airway model and also retained significant amounts of the antiseptic. these results indicate that the effectiveness of antiseptic-impregnated etts in preventing the  growth of bacterial pathogens associated with vap may vary with different organisms.

TI  == comparative in vitro and in vivo study of nine alcohol-based handrubs.
AB  == background: hygienic hand disinfection using alcohol-based handrubs (ahrs) is an  alternative method to conventional handwashing in hospital wards. because a documented choice of such products would consider data from in-care evaluation, we designed a comparative study of 9 ahrs both in vitro and in vivo in actual care conditions. methods: the bactericidal activity of ahrs was first measured in vitro against 4 hospital strains exhibiting multiple antibiotic resistance: acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter aerogenes. in a second time, ahrs were tested in an intensive care unit for antibacterial activity against the cutaneous flora of personnel hands and for acceptance by the care personnel. results: the 9 ahrs could be classified in 3 groups on the basis of their in vitro activity: products of the first group  showed a bactericidal activity higher than 4 log(10) against the 4 strains. only  1 of these products presented simultaneously an effective antibacterial activity  against the cutaneous flora of care personnel hands and a good acceptance by the  care personnel. conclusion: the in vitro study allowed the differentiation of the ahrs tested on the basis of bactericidal activity, but evaluation in an in-care situation allowed further discrimination through both antibacterial activity and  acceptance. thus, the combination of in vitro and in vivo evaluations should provide helpful arguments in the choice of ahrs.

(b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == development of bacterial resistance to the third generation cephalosporins and their clinical use.
AB  == development of gram-negative rods resistance to the third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefoperazone) in connection with their application at the university hospital in olomouc was evaluated in this study. the highest increase in resistance to cefotaxime was detected in enterobacter cloacae (from 22.9% in 1995 to 49.0% in 1997) and enterobacter agglomerans strains (28.0% - 40.5%). in addition, increased resistance to ceftazidime in acinetobacter baumannii (12.5% - 35.1%), enterobacter aerogenes (7.4% - 20.9%), enterobacter cloacae (16.7% - 47.2%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.0% - 26.3%) was observed. finally, the greatest increase in frequency of strains resistant to cefoperazone was observed in e. aerogenes (18.4% - 30.1%), e. agglomerans (31.0%  - 52.3%), e. cloacae (35.5% - 47.2%) and providencia rettgeri (26.5% - 53.2%). a  23.5% increase in third generation cephalosporin use was evident by evaluation of rddd(atb) parameters in 1996 and 1997. corresponding values for individual antibiotics were 26.5% cefotaxime, 20.7% ceftriaxone, and 40.3% ceftazidime increase. however, cefoperazone use decreased by 10.9%.

TI  == impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. however, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. from 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens to 22 agents. linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing d, decreasing %s) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing d, increasing %s). the mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing d, decreasing %s and decreasing d, increasing %s relationships. multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.
