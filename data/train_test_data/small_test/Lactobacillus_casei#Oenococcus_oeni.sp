TI  == selection of lactic acid bacteria from brazilian kefir grains for potential use as starter or probiotic cultures.
AB  == brazilian kefir is a homemade fermented beverage that is obtained by incubating milk or a brown sugar solution with kefir grains that contribute their different  microbiological compositions. it is highly important to isolate and characterize  microorganisms from brazilian kefir grains to obtain starter cultures for the industrial production of a standardized commercial kefir. thus, the present study aimed to isolate lactic acid bacteria from eight kefir grains that were propagated in milk or sugar solutions from five different locations in brazil and to select lactobacillus isolates based on desirable in vitro probiotic properties. one hundred eight isolates from both substrates were identified by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis and/or 16s rrna gene sequencing and  were determined to belong to the following 11 species from the genera: lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus (l.), and oenococcus. leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus kefiranofaciens were isolated only from milk grains, whereas lactobacillus perolens, lactobacillus parafarraginis, lactobacillus diolivorans, and oenococcus oeni were isolated exclusively from sugar water grains. when the microbial compositions of four kefir grains were evaluated with culture-independent analyses, l. kefiranofaciens was observed to predominant in milk grains, whereas lactobacillus hilgardii was most abundant in sugar water kefir. unfortunately, l. hilgardii was not isolated  from any grain, although this bacteria was detected with a culture-independent methodology. fifty-two isolated lactobacilli were tested for gastric juice and bile salt tolerance, antagonism against pathogens, antimicrobial resistance, and  surface hydrophobicity. three lactobacillus strains (l. kefiranofaciens 8u, l. diolivorans 1z, and lactobacillus casei 17u) could be classified as potential probiotics. in conclusion, several lactic acid bacteria that could be used in combination with yeasts as starter cultures for both milk kefir and sugar water kefir were characterized, and the functional properties of several of the lactobacilli isolated from the kefir grains were suggestive of their possible use as probiotics in both kefir and other dairy products.

TI  == the use of the replication region of plasmid prs7 from oenococcus oeni as a putative tool to generate cloning vectors for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a chimeric plasmid, prs7rep (6.1 kb), was constructed using the replication region of prs7, a large plasmid from oenococcus oeni, and pem64, a plasmid derived from pij2925 and containing a gene for resistance to chloramphenicol. prs7rep is a shuttle vector that replicates in escherichia coli using its pij2925 component and in lactic acid bacteria (lab) using the replication region of prs7. high levels of transformants per microg of dna were obtained by electroporation of prs7rep into pediococcus acidilactici (1.5 x 10(7)), lactobacillus plantarum (5.7 x 10(5)), lactobacillus casei (2.3 x 10(5)), leuconostoc citreum (2.7 x 10(5)), and enterococcus faecalis (2.4 x 10(5)). a preliminary optimisation of the technical conditions of electrotransformation showed that p. acidilactici and l. plantarum are better transformed at a later exponential phase of growth, whereas l. casei requires the early exponential phase for better electrotransformation efficiency. prs7rep contains single restriction sites useful for cloning purposes, bamhi, xbai, sali, hincii, sphi and psti, and was maintained at an acceptable rate (>50%) over 100 generations without selective pressure in l. plantarum, but was less stable in l. casei and p. acidilactici. the ability of prs7rep to accept and express other genes was assessed. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the replication region of a plasmid from o. oeni has been used to generate a cloning vector.

TI  == antibacterial activity of hen egg white lysozyme modified by heat and enzymatic treatments against oenological lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of heat-denatured and hydrolyzed hen egg white lysozyme against oenological lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria was investigated. the lysozyme was denatured by heating, and native and heat-denatured lysozymes were hydrolyzed by pepsin. the lytic activity against micrococcus lysodeikticus of heat-denatured lysozyme decreased with the temperature of the heat treatment, whereas the hydrolyzed lysozyme had no enzymatic activity. heat-denatured and hydrolyzed lysozyme preparations showed antimicrobial activity against acetic acid bacteria. lysozyme heated at 90 degrees c exerted potent activity against acetobacter aceti cial-106 and gluconobacter oxydans cial-107 with concentrations required to obtain 50% inhibition of growth (ic50) of 0.089 and 0.013 mg/ml, respectively. this preparation also demonstrated activity against lactobacillus casei cial-52 and oenococcus oeni cial-91 (ic50, 1.37 and 0.45 mg/ml, respectively). the two hydrolysates from native and heat-denatured lysozyme were active against o. oeni  cial-96 (ic50, 2.77 and 0.3 mg/ml, respectively). the results obtained suggest that thermal and enzymatic treatments increase the antibacterial spectrum of hen  egg white lysozyme in relation to oenological microorganisms.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of a spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation metagenome reveals new insights into its bacterial and fungal community diversity.
AB  == this is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic  approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. in addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. the bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with  methods that took all reads into account. the metagenomic sequencing analysis identified hanseniaspora uvarum, hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as erwinia tasmaniensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and oenococcus oeni). furthermore, the sequence reads  associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by myoviridae and siphoviridae, and reflecting lactobacillus as the dominant host. to conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == encapsulated lactic acid bacteria for control of malolactic fermentation in wine.
AB  == the kinetics of both malolactic fermentation in chardonnay wine by encapsulating  lactobacillus casei cells in pectate gel and lyophilized oenococcus oeni culture  has been carried out. the influence of acidity, sulfur dioxide content, and organic acid content on the malolactic activity of the bacteria has been controlled. encapsulated bacteria degraded 30%, of malic acid in white wine, deacidifying it from ph 3.15 to 3.40, whereas the lyophilized culture degraded 48% of malic acid, deacidifying from ph 3.15 to 3.60. the degree of conversion of malic acid in wine by the encapsulated cells was twice as high as that obtained by the free lactobacillus casei cells. the operational stability of calcium pectate gel capsules was 6 months. it has been proved that the encapsulated biocatalyst increases the rate of fermentation, and induces the fermentation to take place at high ethanol concentrations. the proposed encapsulated biocatalyst  is an attractive material for industrial applications in continuous winemaking processes.
