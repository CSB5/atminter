TI  == comparison of oral microbiota in tumor and non-tumor tissues of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == background: bacterial infections have been linked to malignancies due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation. we investigated the association of oral bacteria in oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc/tumor) tissues and compared with adjacent non-tumor mucosa sampled 5 cm distant from the same patient (n = 10). by using culture-independent 16s rrna approaches, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and cloning and sequencing, we assessed the total bacterial diversity in these clinical samples. results: dgge fingerprints showed  variations in the band intensity profiles within non-tumor and tumor tissues of the same patient and among the two groups. the clonal analysis indicated that from a total of 1200 sequences characterized, 80 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected representing six phyla, firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria,  fusobacteria, actinobacteria and uncultivated tm7 in non-tumor and tumor libraries. in combined library, 12 classes, 16 order, 26 families and 40 genera were observed. bacterial species, streptococcus sp. oral taxon 058, peptostreptococcus stomatis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, gemella haemolysans, gemella morbillorum, johnsonella ignava and streptococcus parasanguinis i were highly associated with tumor site where as granulicatella adiacens was prevalent at non-tumor site. streptococcus intermedius was present in 70% of both non-tumor and tumor sites. conclusions: the underlying changes in  the bacterial diversity in the oral mucosal tissues from non-tumor and tumor sites of oscc subjects indicated a shift in bacterial colonization. these most prevalent or unique bacterial species/phylotypes present in tumor tissues may be  associated with oscc and needs to be further investigated with a larger sample size.

TI  == microbial analysis of the autogenous bone collected by bone filter during oral surgery: a clinical study.
AB  == purpose: the purposes of the study presented are to identify the microbial content of the collected bone debris and to determine the antibacterial efficiency of chlorhexidine mouth rinse in reducing the microbial content of the  collected bone debris. patients and methods: twenty-five patients who had asymptomatic fully impacted mandibular third molars bilaterally underwent surgical removal for prophylactic and orthodontic considerations. immediately before surgery all patients rinsed with 10 ml of their assigned solution (chlorhexidine or sterile saline) for 2 minutes. before surgical removal of the teeth, bone debris was collected with a stringent aspiration protocol from the ramus by bone filter. the microbial content of the bone debris was assessed and the bacterial levels between the 2 groups were compared statistically. results: all samples from both groups (chlorhexidine or sterile saline) yielded viable microorganisms. there was no significant difference between the mean/median colony-forming units (cfu)/g values of both group samples, for aerobes (streptococcus salivarius) and anaerobes (bacteroides, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, and veillonella species). with regard to total microorganisms, the mean cfu/g derived from the chlorhexidine group samples were  1.5 x 10(8) cfu/g per bone sample compared with 1.5 x 10(9) cfu/g for the sterile saline control group (p < .05). conclusion: although chlorhexidine rinsing immediately before surgery reduced the levels of total microorganisms when compared with stringent aspiration protocol alone, it has not been found effective on aerobic streptococcus salivarius and, importantly, on anaerobes. the reduced bacterial levels may still carry high infectious risk and may lead to failure in autogenous grafting procedures in oral surgery.

TI  == the bacteriology of the supragingival plaque of child dental patients in kuwait.
AB  == objective: to investigate the bacterial flora of the gingival plaques of pediatric dental patients in order to establish baseline data for future studies  on the complex microbiota of the oral cavity of this group of child dental patients. subjects and methods: forty subjects, aged 3-12 years, were enrolled and investigated after informed consent was obtained. during the patients' first  visit to the dental clinic supragingival plaque samples were collected from the gingival area of buccal and lingual tooth surfaces of all primary and permanent molar teeth using sterile curettes. serially diluted samples were inoculated onto a set of selective and nonselective media and then incubated at the appropriate atmospheric conditions and temperatures. representative colonies of isolates were identified by standard methods, including hemolytic characteristics on blood agar and profiling on api 20s and api 20a as appropriate. results: a total of 183 isolates (123 aerobes and 60 anaerobes) were recovered from the 40 patients with  a mean count of 3 per sample of aerobes compared to 1.5 per sample for the anaerobes. streptococcus sanguis was the predominant aerobic species (23.6%) isolated from 29 (72.5%) of the 40 patients, followed by streptococcus mitis, 19.5 and 60%, streptococcus salivarius, 17.1 and 52.5% and streptococcus mutans,  17.1 and 52.5%. the frequency of isolation of anaerobic bacteria was prevotella spp. 50% from 30 (75%) of the 40 patients, fusobacterium spp., 18.3 and 27.5%, bacteroides spp., porphyromonas spp. and peptostreptococcus spp., 6.7 and 10%, 6.7 and 10%, and 5 and 7.5%, respectively. prevotella intermedia was the single most common species. conclusion: the results show that there were more aerobic/facultative anaerobic bacteria than the obligate anaerobes in the dental  plaque of the pediatric dental patients in kuwait. the high prevalence of the pioneering streptococci as well as black-pigmented prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. indicates that the dental plaques of the children were in the  developing stage, a precursor to the development of periodontal diseases.

TI  == isolation of bacteria from cervical lymph nodes in patients with oral cancer.
AB  == thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. all 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent  extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection)  with free flap reconstruction. a total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. bacterial translocation was found more  often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional  lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). as the gingival carcinoma group includes more t4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved  nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. oral streptococci (streptococcus intermedius, strep. constellatus, strep. oralis, strep. mitis, strep. sanguis, strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. aerobic enteric bacteria (enterococcus, escherichia, klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. among the anaerobic bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer  might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain  the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.

TI  == [aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in chronic sinusitis in adults].
AB  == the aim of the study was to analyse microbiologically samples obtained from 30 patients aged from 21 to 73 years treated for chronic sinusitis. aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 16 patients (53%), and anaerobic organisms only in 5 patients (17%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 9 patients (30%). the isolated aerobic bacteria were as follows: streptococci from  the species streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus group c, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative rods from the genus haemophilus and rods from the enterobacteriaceae family, and strains of moraxella catarrhalis. the isolated anaerobic microorganisms gram-negative rods from the genus prevotella, bacteroides, fusobacterium, gram-positive cocci from the genus peptostreptococcus. other organisms from the genus vailonella, eubacterium and actinomyces were isolated less frequently. in 15 patients only one isolate was recovered, in 15 patients isolated bacteria were mixed with other microorganisms.

TI  == bacteriologic findings in tonsillitis and pericoronitis.
AB  == bacteriologic samples from 31 young men were cultured quantitatively for aerobes  and anaerobes; these samples included 31 specimens of tonsils (16 infected and 15 healthy), 16 specimens from pericoronal pockets of lower third molars (11 infected and 5 symptom-free), and 6 postoperative specimens from lower-third-molar extraction sockets. anaerobes were isolated more often from infected third molars than from infected tonsils (14.5 isolates vs. 8.4 isolates, respectively; p < .001). infected tonsil samples contained significantly more anaerobic species if an adjacent partly erupted lower third molar was present rather than absent (10.3 isolates vs. 6.9 isolates, respectively; p < .05). eubacterium aerofaciens, clostridium species, peptostreptococcus micros, and prevotella oris were frequently isolated. streptococcus salivarius was found more frequently in tonsillar specimens, whereas corynebacterium species, prevotella denticola, capnocytophaga species, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and lactobacillus species were more common in pericoronal pocket samples. thus, partial eruption of lower third molars increases the number of anaerobic bacterial species on tonsils and many species can be isolated simultaneously from both tonsils and lower third molars.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == physico-chemical and structural properties of the surfaces of peptostreptococcus  micros and streptococcus mitis as compared to those of mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the surface properties of nine streptococcus mitis and four peptostreptococcus micros strains from the oral cavity were examined and compared with a large group of oral streptococci. zeta potential and contact angle measurements were employed to determine physico-chemical cell surface properties. in addition, elemental surface concentration ratios were obtained via x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,  and surface structures were examined with transmission electron microscopy. the s. mitis and p. micros strains were found to have higher isoelectric points, higher hydrophobicities and higher n/c surface concentration ratios than some other oral streptococci. the combined data suggest that both species possess large amounts of surface protein. all the s. mitis strains displayed abundant surface fibrils in negative staining, but the p. micros strains were devoid of surface appendages indicating that surface protein is present in different forms  in the two species. the surfaces of s. mitis and p. micros type strains differed  significantly from the other strains examined.

TI  == an in vitro method to study the adherence of bacteria to saliva-treated tooth enamel sections.
AB  == an in vitro bacterial adherence assay which employed human tooth enamel sections  precoated with saliva and an epifluorescent staining technique with acridine orange was developed. the assay was used to study the adherence properties of fresh and type strains of the following oral bacterial species: bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, capnocytophaga species, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus species, veillonella species, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguis. approximately half of the bacteria tested adhered well to  enamel, including the fresh isolates of b. gingivalis, b. intermedius, veillonella species and s. sanguis. adherence did not correlate in all cases with the known distribution of these species in vivo. three-quarters of the fresh strains adhered better than the type strains of the same species. the assay method is an alternative to the widely used hydroxyapatite bead assay.

TI  == bacteremia after tooth extractions studied with the aid of prereduced anaerobically sterilized culture media.
AB  == both prereduced molten agar and broth and aerobic molten agar and broth were inoculated with blood samples collected from patients with periodontitis, but in  otherwise good health, both before and after extraction of two or more teeth. postoperative blood samples from 23 of 25 patients sampled yielded anaerobic and  facultative species. colony counts from nine samples yielded from less than 1 to  over 100 colonies per ml of blood. organisms detected were species belonging to the genera bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, leptotrichia, propionibacterium, peptococcus, veillonella, plus streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius, vibrio forms, and strains resembling s. mutans. the data indicate that prereduced anaerobically sterilized culture medium with polyanethol sulfonate is effective for detecting anaerobic species in bacteremia and that anaerobic species can be prevalent in bacteremias immediately after tooth extraction in patients with periodontitis.
