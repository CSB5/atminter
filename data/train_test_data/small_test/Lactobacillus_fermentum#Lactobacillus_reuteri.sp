TI  == probiotic and technological properties of lactobacillus spp. strains from the human stomach in the search for potential candidates against gastric microbial dysbiosis.
AB  == this work characterizes a set of lactobacilli strains isolated from the stomach of healthy humans that might serve as probiotic cultures. ten different strains were recognized by rep-pcr and pfge fingerprinting among 19 isolates from gastric biopsies and stomach juice samples. these strains belonged to five species, lactobacillus gasseri (3), lactobacillus reuteri (2), lactobacillus vaginalis (2), lactobacillus fermentum (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). all ten strains were subjected to a series of in vitro tests to assess their functional and technological properties, including acid resistance, bile tolerance, adhesion to  epithelial gastric cells, production of antimicrobial compounds, inhibition of helicobacter pylori, antioxidative activity, antibiotic resistance, carbohydrate  fermentation, glycosidic activities, and ability to grow in milk. as expected, given their origin, all strains showed good resistance to low ph (3.0), with small reductions in counts after 90 min exposition to this ph. species- and strain-specific differences were detected in terms of the production of antimicrobials, antagonistic effects toward h. pylori, antioxidative activity and adhesion to gastric epithelial cells. none of the strains showed atypical resistance to a series of 16 antibiotics of clinical and veterinary importance. two l. reuteri strains were deemed as the most appropriate candidates to be used  as potential probiotics against microbial gastric disorders; these showed good survival under gastrointestinal conditions reproduced in vitro, along with strong anti-helicobacter and antioxidative activities. the two l. reuteri strains further displayed appropriated technological traits for their inclusion as adjunct functional cultures in fermented dairy products.

TI  == cholesterol assimilation by lactobacillus probiotic bacteria: an in vitro investigation.
AB  == excess cholesterol is associated with cardiovascular diseases (cvd), an important cause of mortality worldwide. current cvd therapeutic measures, lifestyle and dietary interventions, and pharmaceutical agents for regulating cholesterol levels are inadequate. probiotic bacteria have demonstrated potential to lower cholesterol levels by different mechanisms, including bile salt hydrolase activity, production of compounds that inhibit enzymes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a, and cholesterol assimilation. this work investigates 11 lactobacillus strains for cholesterol assimilation. probiotic strains for investigation were selected from the literature: lactobacillus reuteri ncimb 11951, l. reuteri ncimb 701359, l. reuteri ncimb 702655, l. reuteri ncimb 701089, l. reuteri ncimb 702656, lactobacillus fermentum ncimb 5221, l. fermentum ncimb 8829, l. fermentum ncimb 2797, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103 gg, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 314, and lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917. cholesterol assimilation was investigated in culture media and under simulated intestinal conditions. the best cholesterol assimilator was l. plantarum atcc 14917 (15.18+/-0.55 mg/10(10) cfu) in mrs broth. l. reuteri ncimb 701089 assimilated over 67% (2254.70+/-63.33 mg/10(10) cfu) of cholesterol, the most of  all the strains, under intestinal conditions. this work demonstrates that probiotic bacteria can assimilate cholesterol under intestinal conditions, with l. reuteri ncimb 701089 showing great potential as a cvd therapeutic.

TI  == lactobacillus gorillae sp. nov., isolated from the faeces of captive and wild western lowland gorillas (gorilla gorilla gorilla).
AB  == four strains of gram-staining-positive, anaerobic rods were isolated from the faeces of western lowland gorillas (gorilla gorilla gorilla). three strains, kz01(t), kz02 and kz03, were isolated at the kyoto city zoo, japan, and one strain, gg02, was isolated in the moukalaba-doudou national park, gabon. these strains were investigated taxonomically. these strains belonged to the lactobacillus reuteri phylogenetic group according to phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences and specific phenotypic characteristics. phylogenetic  analysis of their 16s rrna gene sequences revealed that strains kz01(t), kz02, kz03 and gg02 formed a single monophyletic cluster and had a distinct line of descent. based on sequence similarity of the 16s rrna gene, lactobacillus fermentum jcm 1173(t) (96.6 %) was the closest neighbour to these novel strains,  although it was clear that these strains belonged to a different species. partial phes sequences also supported these relationships. dna-dna relatedness between strain kz01(t) and l. fermentum jcm 1173(t) was less than 22 % and the dna g+c content of strain kz01(t) was 50.7 mol%. the cell-wall peptidoglycan type was a4beta (l-orn-d-asp) and the major fatty acids were c16 : 0, c18 : 1omega9c and c19 : 1 cyclo 9,10. therefore, based on phylogenetic, phenotypic and physiological evidence, these strains represent a novel species of the genus lactobacillus, for which the name lactobacillus gorillae sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is kz01(t) ( = jcm 19575(t) = dsm 28356(t)).

TI  == investigation of probiotic bacteria as dental caries and periodontal disease biotherapeutics.
AB  == oral diseases, specifically dental caries and periodontal disease, are characterised by increases in pathogenic microorganisms, increased demineralisation and increased inflammation and levels of inflammatory markers. despite the therapeutic strategies, oral diseases have elevated prevalence rates. recent work has demonstrated that probiotic bio-therapeutics can decrease oral pathogen counts, including caries-causing streptococcus mutans and oral inflammation. the aim of this work was to investigate putative probiotic bacteria, selected for s. mutans inhibition and for their oral health-promoting characteristics. the probiotic bacteria were screened for s. mutans inhibition, probiotic bacteriocin activity, salivary ph modulation, probiotic nutrient (sucrose) competition, probiotic co-aggregation with s. mutans, bacterial attachment to oral epithelial keratinocytes, bacterial nitric oxide production and bacterial antioxidant activity. the results indicate that lactobacillus reuteri strains ncimb 701359, ncimb 701089, ncimb 702655 and ncimb 702656 inhibited s. mutans to non-detectable levels (<10 cfu/ml). l. reuteri strains also demonstrated the highest antioxidant capacity of the tested strains (7.73-13.99 microm trolox equivalents), suggesting their use as both caries and periodontal disease therapeutics. although lactobacillus fermentum ncimb 5221 inhibited s. mutans at lower levels, it significantly buffered the ph (4.18) of saliva containing s. mutans, co-aggregated with s. mutans (10.09%), demonstrated  high levels of sucrose consumption (138.11 mm) and successfully attached to gingival epithelial cells (11%). this study identified four l. reuteri strains and one l. fermentum strain to be further investigated as oral disease biotherapeutics.

TI  == quantitative high-resolution melting pcr analysis for monitoring of fermentation  microbiota in sourdough.
AB  == current methods of monitoring the microbial ecology of food fermentation system are generally labor intensive and/or time consuming. this study developed two methods based on high-resolution melting curves (hrm) to monitor sourdough microbiota during fermentation and to investigate the effect of cereal substrate  on microbial ecology. a strain cocktail of lactobacillus fermentum fua3165, lactobacillus plantarum fua3309, lactobacillus paracasei fua3166 and lactobacillus reuteri fua3168 was used to ferment red (town and pan8609) and white (commercial and segaolane) sorghum sourdough, and wheat sourdough. the microbial composition of sourdoughs was determined by plate count and hrm-qpcr to differentiate at the species level. the resistance of each species to sorghum phenolic extract was measured. there was no difference in microbial composition among the four sorghum sourdoughs, with l. fermentum fua3165 in all sourdoughs. the competiveness of the strains in sorghum sourdoughs corresponded to their resistance to sorghum phenolic extract. in a second experiment, five l. reuteri strains, the human-lineage strains fua3400 and 3401 isolated from wheat sourdough, the rodent-lineage strain fua5448 isolated from rye sourdough and the  sorghum isolates fua3168 and 3324, were used to ferment wheat, rye and sorghum sourdoughs. the microbial composition of sourdoughs was determined by plate counts and hrm-qpcr to different l. reuteri strains representing different host-adapted lineages. no difference among different substrates was observed; indicating cereal type had no selective effect on sourdough microbial ecology. in conclusion, hrm-qpcr assays were established as rapid and highly specific tool for monitoring of sourdough microbiota. the ability to distinguish highly similar microbes in samples containing only few genotypes makes hrm-qpcr suitable for quality control in other food fermentation systems. the presence of phenolic compounds in sorghum sourdough favored organisms with higher resistance.

TI  == diversity and functional characterization of lactobacillus spp. isolated throughout the ripening of a hard cheese.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the lactobacillus spp. intra- and inter- species diversity in a piedmont hard cheese made of raw milk without thermal treatment and without addition of industrial starter, and to perform a first screening for potential functional properties. a total of 586 isolates were collected during the cheese production and identified by means of molecular methods: three hundred and four were identified as lactobacillus rhamnosus, two hundred and forty as lactobacillus helveticus, twenty six as lactobacillus fermentum, eleven as lactobacillus delbrueckii, three as lactobacillus pontis, and two as lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus reuteri, respectively. a high  genetic heterogeneity was detected by using the repetitive bacterial dna element  fingerprinting (rep-pcr) with the use of (gtg)5 primer resulting in eight clusters of l. helveticus and sixteen clusters in the case of l. rhamnosus. most  of isolates showed a high auto-aggregation property, low hydrophobicity values, and a general low survival to simulated digestion process. however, sixteen isolates showed promising functional characteristics.

TI  == antifungal activity of lactobacilli and its relationship with 3-phenyllactic acid production.
AB  == in this study, 13 lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains (including 5 lactobacillus casei, 2 lactobacillus rhamnosus, 2 lactobacillus fermentum, 1 lactobacillus acidophilus, 1 lactobacillus plantarum, 1 lactobacillus sakei, and 1 lactobacillus reuteri species) were assessed for both their antifungal activity against four food spoilage molds (colletotrichum gloeosporioides, botrytis cinerea, penicillium expansum, and aspergillus flavus) and their capability to produce the novel antimicrobial compound 3-phenyllactic acid (pla). results demonstrated that all molds were sensitive to varying degrees to the cell-free supernatants (cfs) from lab fermentations (p<0.05), with growth inhibitions ranging from 2.65% to 66.82%. the inhibition ability of cfs was not affected by a heating treatment (121 degrees c, 20 min); however, it declined markedly when the ph of cfs was adjusted to 6.5. with the exception of l. plantarum nrrl b-4496 and l. acidophilus atcc-4495, all other lab strains produced pla ranging from 0.021 to 0.275 mm. the high minimum inhibitory concentration for commercial pla (3.01-36.10mm) suggests that it cannot be considered the only compound related with the antifungal potential of studied lab and that synergistic effects may exist among other metabolism products.

TI  == enrichment of conjugated linoleic acid (cla) in hen eggs and broiler chickens meat by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == 1. the aim of this work was to compare conjugated linoleic acid (cla) concentrations in chickens supplemented with 4 american tissue culture collection (atcc) bacterial strains, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus lactis, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus fermentum, and 4 isolates of lactobacillus  reuteri from camel, cattle, sheep and goat rumen extracts. 2. micro-organisms were grown anaerobically in mrs broth, and 10(6) cfu/ml of bacteria were administered orally to mixed-sex, 1-d-old broiler chickens weekly for 4 weeks and to 23-week-old layer hens weekly for 6 weeks. 3. the 4 strains were evaluated for their effects on synthesis of cla in hen eggs and broiler meat cuts. 4. administration of pure lactobacillus and isolated l. reuteri strains from camel,  cattle, goat and sheep led to significantly increased cla concentrations of 0.2-1.2 mg/g of fat in eggs and 0.3-1.88 mg/g of fat in broiler chicken flesh homogenates of leg, thigh and breast. 5. these data demonstrate that lactic acid  bacteria of animal origin (l. reuteri) significantly enhanced cla synthesis in both eggs and broiler meat cuts.

TI  == polysaccharide from seeds of plantago asiatica l. affects lipid metabolism and colon microbiota of mouse.
AB  == polysaccharide from the seeds of plantago asiatica l. was given via oral administration to mice (0.4 g/kg body weight, 30 days) to observe its effects on  mouse nutrient metabolism and colon microbiota. it was found the polysaccharide intake could lower the apparent absorption of lipid. total triglyceride, cholesterol, and atherogenic index in blood serum with total lipid and cholesterol levels in liver of polysaccharide group mice were all significantly lower than those of the control group (p < 0.05). furthermore, the effect of the  polysaccharide intake on mouse colon bacterial communities was investigated. mice from the polysaccharide group showed a higher colon bacterial diversity than the  control group. bacteroides sp., eubacterium sp., butyrate-producing bacteria butyrivibrio sp., and probiotics bifidobacterium bifidum , lactobacillus fermentum , and lactobacillus reuteri in mouse colon were all increased after polysaccharide intake. these indicated that the intake of polysaccharide from p.  asiatica l. could be beneficial for lipid metabolism and colon microbiota.

TI  == antibiotic resistances of intestinal lactobacilli isolated from wild boars.
AB  == acquired antibiotic resistances have been reported in lactobacilli of various animal and food sources, but there are no data from wild boar. the objective was  a preliminary examination of the antibiotic resistance prevalence of intrinsically vancomycin-resistant lactobacilli isolated from wild boar intestines and analysis of the genetic determinants implicated. out of three wild boars, 121 lactobacilli were recovered and grouped according to their whole cell  protein patterns. initial phenotypic screening revealed that all were susceptible to erythromycin (2 mug/ml), but 30 were resistant to tetracycline (32 mug/ml). based on randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr clustering, 64 strains were selected as representative genotypes for identification and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determination. partial 16s rrna gene sequencing identified four species: (i) l. mucosae (n=57), (ii) l. reuteri (n=47), (iii) l. fermentum (n=12), and (iv) l. murinus (n=5). most heterofermentative strains displayed low  mics for ampicillin (amp), chloramphenicol (chl), streptomycin (str), kanamycin (kan), gentamicin (gen), erythromycin (ery), quinupristin/dalfopristin (q/d), and clindamycin (cli). atypical mics were found mainly in l. mucosae and l. reuteri for tet, kan, str, amp and chl, but except the tet mics of l. mucosae mostly at low level. l. murinus strains revealed atypical mics for aminoglycosides, and/or  chl, amp, cli. pcr screening detected tet(w) in 12 and tet(m) in one of heterofermentative strains, as well as the aph(3')-iii kanamycin gene in l. murinus. this is the first report showing acquired antibiotic resistance determinants in intestinal lactobacilli of wild boar origin.

TI  == molecular identification of lactobacillus spp. associated with puba, a brazilian  fermented cassava food.
AB  == puba or carima is a brazilian staple food obtained by spontaneous submerged fermentation of cassava roots. a total of 116 lactobacilli and three cocci isolates from 20 commercial puba samples were recovered on de man, rogosa and sharpe agar (mrs); they were characterized for their antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens and identified taxonomically by classical and molecular methods. in all samples, lactic acid bacteria were recovered as the dominant microbiota (7.86 +/- 0.41 log10 cfu/g). 16s-23s rrna ardra pattern assigned 116 isolates to the lactobacillus genus, represented by the species lactobacillus fermentum (59 isolates), lactobacillus delbrueckii (18 isolates), lactobacillus casei (9 isolates), lactobacillus reuteri (6 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (3 isolates), lactobacillus gasseri (2 isolates), lactobacillus nagelii (1 isolate), and lactobacillus plantarum group (18 isolates). reca gene-multiplex pcr analysis revealed that l. plantarum group isolates belonged to lactobacillus plantarum (15 isolates) and lactobacillus paraplantarum (3 isolates). genomic diversity was investigated by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence)-based pcr using the primer eric2 (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus). the lactobacillus isolates exhibited genetic heterogeneity and species-specific fingerprint patterns. all the isolates showed antagonistic activity against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria tested. this antibacterial effect was attributed to acid production, except in the cases of three isolates that apparently produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. this study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of lactobacillus spp. of puba.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == strain-dependent augmentation of tight-junction barrier function in human primary epidermal keratinocytes by lactobacillus and bifidobacterium lysates.
AB  == in this study, we investigated whether probiotic lysates can modify the tight-junction function of human primary keratinocytes. the keratinocytes were grown on cell culture inserts and treated with lysates from bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum,  or lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. with the exception of l. fermentum (which decreased cell viability), all strains markedly enhanced tight-junction barrier function within 24 h, as assessed by measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (teer). however, b. longum and l. rhamnosus gg were the most efficacious, producing dose-dependent increases in resistance that were maintained for 4 days. these increases in teer correlated with elevated expression of tight-junction protein components. neutralization of toll-like receptor 2 abolished both the increase in teer and expression of tight-junction proteins induced by b. longum, but not l. rhamnosus gg. these data suggest that some bacterial strains increase tight-junction function via modulation of protein components but the different pathways involved may vary depending on the bacterial strain.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == bacteriophage-encoded lytic enzymes control growth of contaminating lactobacillus found in fuel ethanol fermentations.
AB  == background: reduced yields of ethanol due to bacterial contamination in fermentation cultures weaken the economics of biofuel production. lactic acid bacteria are considered the most problematic, and surveys of commercial fuel ethanol facilities have found that species of lactobacillus are predominant. bacteriophage lytic enzymes are peptidoglycan hydrolases that can degrade the gram positive cell wall when exposed externally and provide a novel source of antimicrobials that are highly refractory to resistance development. results: the streptococcal phage lambdasa2 (lambdasa2) endolysin demonstrated strong lytic activity towards 17 of 22 strains of lactobacilli, staphylococci or streptococci  and maintained an optimal specific activity at ph 5.5 and in the presence of </=  5% ethanol (fermentation conditions) toward l. fermentum. lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins lysa, lysa2 and lysgay showed exolytic activity towards  60% of the lactobacilli tested including four l. fermentum isolates from fuel ethanol fermentations. in turbidity reduction assays lysa was able to reduce optical density >75% for 50% of the sensitive strains and >50% for the remaining  strains. lysa2 and lysgay were only able to decrease cellular turbidity by <50%.  optimal specific activities were achieved for lysa, lysa2, and lysgay at ph 5.5.  the presence of ethanol (</=5%) did not reduce the lytic activity. lysins were able to reduce both l. fermentum (br0315-1) (lambdasa2 endolysin) and l. reuteri  (b-14171) (lysa) contaminants in mock fermentations of corn fiber hydrolysates. conclusion: bacteriophage lytic enzymes are strong candidates for application as  antimicrobials to control lactic acid bacterial contamination in fuel ethanol fermentations.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == the dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated during traditional fura processing in ghana.
AB  == fura is a millet-based spontaneously fermented dumpling produced and consumed in  parts of west africa, particularly nigeria, burkina faso and ghana. from eight traditional fura production sites in northern ghana, 862 lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified to species level using a combination of genotypic and phenotypic methods including (gtg)(5)-based pcr fingerprinting and 16s rrna gene sequencing, multiplex pcr by means of reca gene sequence comparison, conventional morphological characteristics and carbohydrate fermentation profiling. during millet dough fermentation, ph decreased from 5.6-6.4 to 4.1-3.7 and total lactic acid bacteria (lab) counts increased from 4.4-5.3 to 7.9-9.2 log(10) (cfu/g). the initial stages of the fermentation were characterized by co-dominance of homo- and heterofermentative species of pediococcus acidilactici, weisella confusa, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus paraplantarum whereas l. fermentum was dominating at the end of the fermentation. l. fermentum was predominant in all fermentations (p < 0.05) and a high uniformity was observed among production sites regarding the dominance of l. fermentum. l. fermentum and w. confusa were isolated in all production sites and almost at all fermentation stages indicating that they are indigenous to traditional fura processing. the other lab bacteria species which comprised a minor proportion of the total lab occurred occasionally and in an irregular pattern among the production sites.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == mannitol production by heterofermentative lactobacillus reuteri crl 1101 and lactobacillus fermentum crl 573 in free and controlled ph batch fermentations.
AB  == certain lactic acid bacteria, especially heterofermentative strains, are capable  to produce mannitol under adequate culture conditions. in this study, mannitol production by lactobacillus reuteri crl 1101 and lactobacillus fermentum crl 573  in modified mrs medium containing a mixture of fructose and glucose in a 6.5:1.0  ratio was investigated during batch fermentations with free ph and constant ph 6.0 and 5.0. mannitol production and yields were higher under constant ph conditions compared with fermentations with free ph, the increase being more pronounced in the case of the l. fermentum strain. maximum mannitol production and yields from fructose for l. reuteri crl 1101 (122 mm and 75.7 mol%, respectively) and l. fermentum crl 573 (312 mm and 93.5 mol%, respectively) were  found at ph 5.0. interestingly, depending on the ph conditions, fructose was used only as an alternative external electron acceptor or as both electron acceptor and energy source in the case of the l. reuteri strain. in contrast, l. fermentum crl 573 used fructose both as electron acceptor and carbon source simultaneously, independently of the ph value, which strongly affected mannitol production by this strain. studies on the metabolism of these relevant mannitol-producing lactobacilli provide important knowledge to either produce mannitol to be used as food additive or to produce it in situ during fermented food production.

TI  == characterization of tetracycline resistance lactobacilli isolated from swine intestines at western area of taiwan.
AB  == to investigate the frequency of tetracycline resistance (tet-r) lactobacilli in pig intestines, a total of 256 pig colons were analyzed and found to contain typical colonies of tet-r lactic acid bacteria in every sample, ranging from 3.2  x 10(3) to 6.6 x 10(5) cfu/cm(2). from these samples, a total of 159 isolates of  tet-r lactobacilli were obtained and identified as belonging to 11 species, including lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus ruminis, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus letivazi. based on the efsa (2008) breakpoints, all isolates, after mic analysis, were qualified as tet-r, from which the significant high tet-r mic(50) and mic(90) values indicated an ecological distribution of tet-r lactobacilli mostly with high resistance potency in pig colons. pcr-detection identified 5 tet genes in these isolates, the most predominant one being tet (w), followed by tet (m), (l), (k), and (q). their detection rates were 82.0%, 22.5%, 14.4%, 8.1% and 0.9%, respectively. noteworthily, isolates of the same species carrying identical tet gene(s) usually had a wide different mic values. furthermore, strain-subtyping of these isolates  by rep-pcr demonstrated a notable genotypic biodiversity % (average = 62%).

TI  == structure-function relationships of the antibacterial activity of phenolic acids  and their metabolism by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to determine structure-function relationships of antibacterial phenolic acids and their metabolites produced by lactic acid bacteria (lab). methods and results: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 6 hydroxybenzoic and 6 hydroxycinnamic acids were determined with lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus hammesii, escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis as indicator strains. the antibacterial activity of phenolic acids increased at lower ph. a decreasing number of hydroxyl groups enhanced the activity of hydroxybenzoic acids, but had  minor effects on hydroxycinnamic acids. substitution of hydroxyl groups with methoxy groups increased the activity of hydroxybenzoic, but not of hydroxycinnamic, acid. metabolism of chlorogenic, caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, protocatechuic or p-hydroxybenzoic acids by l. plantarum, l. hammesii, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus reuteri was analysed by lc-dad-ms. furthermore, mics of substrates and metabolites were compared. decarboxylated and/or reduced metabolites of phenolic acids had a lower activity than the substrates. strain-specific metabolism of phenolic acids generally corresponded to resistance. conclusions: the influence of lipophilicity on the antibacterial activity of hydroxybenzoic acids is stronger than that of hydroxycinnamic acids.  metabolism of phenolic acids by lab detoxifies phenolic acids. significance and impact of the study: results allow the targeted selection of plant extracts for food preservation, and selection of starter cultures for fermented products.

TI  == microbiological and chemical characterisation of ting, a sorghum-based sourdough  product from botswana.
AB  == ting is a fermented sorghum product of botswana which is used to prepare porridges of different consistencies. this study aimed to characterise ting with  respect to fermentation microbiota and metabolite composition, and to develop starter cultures for ting fermentation. the ph values of 10 ting samples from botswana ranged between 3.5 and 4.0 and cell counts ranged between 1.2x10(8) and  1.2x10(10)cfu/g lactic acid bacteria. yeast cell counts were below 10(5)cfu/g in  all samples and enterobacteriaceae were less than 10 cfu/g. the microbiota of samples consisted of 2-4 dominant strains and strains were identified based on the sequence of their 16s rrna genes as lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus harbinensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus coryniformis. binary strain combinations were employed as starter cultures to produce ting. major fermentation products were lactate, acetate and ethanol, additionally, 1,2 propanediol and 1,3 propanediol were produced by some strains. all strains were capable of producing ting, which was accompanied by a decrease in ph from 6.3 to  4 within 8h. traditionally processed ting requires 2 to 3 days to attain a ph below 4; the starter cultures thus reduced the fermentation time to 8h.

TI  == an in vitro protocol for direct isolation of potential probiotic lactobacilli from raw bovine milk and traditional fermented milks.
AB  == a method for isolating potential probiotic lactobacilli directly from traditional milk-based foods was developed. the novel digestion/enrichment protocol was set up taking care to minimize the protective effect of milk proteins and fats and was validated testing three commercial fermented milks containing well-known probiotic lactobacillus strains. only probiotic bacteria claimed in the label were isolated from two out of three commercial fermented milks. the application of the new protocol to 15 raw milk samples and 6 traditional fermented milk samples made it feasible to isolate 11 potential probiotic lactobacillus strains  belonging to lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus vaginalis species. even though further analyses need to ascertain functional properties of these lactobacilli, the novel protocol set-up  makes it feasible to isolate quickly potential probiotic strains from traditional milk-based foods reducing the amount of time required by traditional procedures that, in addition, do not allow to isolate microorganisms occurring as sub-dominant populations.

TI  == diversity and metabolic impact of intestinal lactobacillus species in healthy adults and the elderly.
AB  == the present study aimed at assessing the counts and species distribution of intestinal lactobacilli and exploring if the data are associated with bmi and blood glucose level in healthy adults and elderly persons. the bmi (p < 0.01), the level of fasting blood glucose (p < 0.001) and the total counts of lactobacilli (p < 0.01 by bacteriology; p < 0.001 by real-time pcr) were higher in the elderly. the number of species in adults was lower (p < 0.05), who were more often colonised with lactobacillus acidophilus (p = 0.031) and l. helveticus (p < 0.001). in contrast, l. plantarum (p = 0.035), l. paracasei (p < 0.001) and  l. reuteri (p = 0.031) were more prevalent in the elderly. l. rhamnosus was detected in adults (p < 0.001), but not in any elderly person. bmi was associated with counts of lactobacilli, adjusted for age and sex (p = 0.008). the higher bmi in both groups of persons was associated with the presence of obligate homofermentative lactobacilli and l. sakei, both adjusted for age and sex. plasma glucose values were positively correlated with bmi and negatively correlated with colonisation with l. paracasei (p = 0.0238) in adults and on the borderline with  l. fermentum (p = 0.052) in the elderly. thus, the species-specific pcr analysis  of lactobacillus sp. combined with viable plating data indicates substantial age-related structural differences in the intestinal lactobacilli communities. the higher counts of intestinal lactobacillus sp. are associated with higher bmi  and blood glucose content, while their specific fermentative groups and species of lactobacilli appear at different glucose levels both in adults and in the elderly.

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria fermentation of human milk oligosaccharide components, human milk oligosaccharides and galactooligosaccharides.
AB  == human milk contains about 7% lactose and 1% human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) consisting of lactose with linked fucose, n-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. in infant formula, galactooligosaccharides (goss) are added to replace hmos. this study investigated the ability of six strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab), lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri, streptococcus thermophilus and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris, to digest hmo components, defined hmos, and goss. all strains grew on lactose and glucose. n-acetylglucosamine utilization varied between strains and was maximal in l. plantarum; fucose utilization was low or absent in  all strains. both hetero- and homofermentative lab utilized n-acetylglucosamine via the embden-meyerhof pathway. lactobacillus acidophilus and l. plantarum were  the most versatile in hydrolysing pnp analogues and the only strains releasing mono- and disaccharides from defined hmos. whole cells of all six lab hydrolysed  onp-galactoside and pnp-galactoside indicating beta-galactosidase activity. high  beta-galactosidase activity of l. reuteri, l. fermentum, s. thermophilus and l. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris whole cells correlated to lactose and gos hydrolysis. hydrolysis of lactose and goss by heterologously expressed beta-galactosidases confirmed that lab beta-galactosidases are involved in gos digestion. in summary, the strains of lab used were not capable of utilizing complex hmos but metabolized hmo components and goss.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of probiotic and clinical lactobacillus strains in relation to safety aspects of probiotics.
AB  == the evaluation of the safety of probiotic strains includes the exclusion of antibiotic resistance of clinical importance. ninety-two strains from the genus lactobacillus isolated from probiotics, food, and clinical sources were included  in the investigation. species tested were the l. acidophilus group, l. casei group, l. reuteri/fermentum group, and l. sakei/curvatus group. cell and colony morphology, fermentation patterns, and growth characteristics as well as soluble  whole cell proteins were analyzed. antibiotic resistance against clinically important agents was determined by broth dilution tests. the vana and tet genes were confirmed. resistances occurred mainly against gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, sulfonamides, and, in some cases, glycopeptides. the natural glycopeptide resistance within the l. casei group and l. reuteri appears to be not of clinical relevance, as there was no vana gene present. therefore, the transfer of this resistance is very unlikely. tet-(a), -(b), -(c), -(m), or -(o)  gene could not be detected. the protein fingerprinting within the l. casei group  proved that l. rhamnosus strains of clinical origin clustered together with probiotic strains. for safety evaluations resistance patterns of a broad range of strains are a useful criterion together with the exclusion of known resistance genes (like the vana gene) and can be used for decision making on the safety of probiotics, both by authorization bodies and manufacturers.

TI  == phenolic acids and flavonoids in nonfermented and fermented red sorghum (sorghum  bicolor (l.) moench).
AB  == this study aimed to identify phenolic acids and flavonoids in the red sorghum variety pan 3860 and to determine changes in their concentrations during fermentation with lactobacilli. sorghum sourdoughs fermented with two binary strain combinations, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus reuteri , were compared to chemically acidified controls. four glycerol esters were tentatively identified, caffeoylglycerol, dicaffeoylglycerol, coumaroyl-caffeoylglycerol, and coumaroyl-feruloylglycerol, that have previously not been detected in sorghum. chemical acidification resulted in hydrolysis of phenolic acid esters and flavonoid glucosides. during lactic fermentation, phenolic acids, phenolic acid esters, and flavonoid glucosides were metabolized. analysis of ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and naringenin-glucoside contents in single-strain cultures of lactobacilli demonstrated that glucosidase, phenolic acid reductase, and phenolic acid decarboxylase activities contributed to polyphenol metabolism. this study demonstrates that microbial fermentation of sorghum affects the content of polyphenols and can influence the nutritional value and antimicrobial activity of sorghum.

TI  == development of buckwheat and teff sourdoughs with the use of commercial starters.
AB  == in this study we investigated the suitability of commercial starters for the production of gluten free sourdoughs. for this purpose, four different laboratory scale sourdoughs were developed from the flours buckwheat or teff. two different  starters (sa, sb) were used to start the fermentations, which were carried out under two technological conditions. sourdoughs were propagated by back-slopping until the stability was reached. the composition of the stable sourdoughs was investigated by culture dependent techniques and the development of the dominant  biota was monitored by pcr-dgge. unique and complex lab and yeasts communities were detected in each sourdough, comprising strains which originated from the flours. the competitiveness of the starter lab varied according to the substrate  and the fermentation conditions applied. among the lab present in both sa and sb, l. helveticus and l. paracasei strains did not persist in buckwheat or teff sourdoughs. lc. argentinum was competitive only in buckwheat sourdoughs, whereas  l. reuteri persisted only in teff sourdough. l. fermentum and l. helveticus present in both starters dominated only the sourdoughs fermented at the higher temperature. remarkably, the starter yeasts were outcompeted by spontaneous yeast strains, i.e. kazachstania barnetti and saccharomyces cerevisiae in teff sourdoughs, whereas no yeasts were isolated from buckwheat sourdoughs. the isolation of autochthonous lab and yeasts from the stable teff and buckwheat sourdoughs indicates that both flours represent an important reservoir for the isolation of novel and competitive starters for the production of gluten free sourdough bread.

TI  == intestinal lactobacillus sp. is associated with some cellular and metabolic characteristics of blood in elderly people.
AB  == the higher counts or particular groups (firmicutes/bacteroidetes) of intestinal microbiota are related to host metabolic reactions, supporting a balance of human ecosystem. we further explored whether intestinal lactobacilli were associated with some principal cellular and metabolic markers of blood in 38 healthy >65-year-old persons. the questionnaire, routine clinical and laboratory data of  blood indices as much as the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-ldl) and baseline diene conjugates in low-density lipoprotein (bdc-ldl) of blood sera were explored. the pcr-based intestinal lactobacillus sp. composition and counts of cultivable lactobacilli (lab) were tested. the facultative heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus paracasei) were the most frequent (89 and 97%, respectively) species found, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus reuteri were present in almost half of the elderly persons. the number of species simultaneously colonizing the individuals ranged from 1 to 7 (median 4). in elderly consuming probiotics the lab counts were significantly higher than in these not consuming (median 7.8, range 4.2-10.8 vs. median 6.3, range 3.3-9.7 log cfu/g; p=0.005), adjusted (or=1.71, ci95 1.04-2.82; p=0.035) for age and body mass index (bmi). the colonization by l. acidophilus was negatively related (r=-0.367, p=0.0275) to l. reuteri, staying significant after adjusting for age, sex and bmi (or=0.16, ci95 0.04-0.73; p=0.018). however, the blood glucose concentration showed a tendency for a negative correlation for colonization with lactobacillus fermentum (r=-0.309, p=0.062) adjusted for bmi (adj. r(2)=0.181; p=0.013) but not for age and sex. the higher white blood cells (wbc) count was positively related (r=0.434, p=0.007) to presence of lactobacillus reuteri adjusted for age, sex and bmi (adj. r(2)=0.193, p=0.027). the lower values of ox-ldl were predicted by higher counts of cultivable lactobacilli adjusted by sex, age and bmi (r = -0.389, p = 0.016; adj. r(2)=0.184 p=0.029). in conclusion, the pilot study of elderly persons shows that the intestinal lactobacilli are tightly associated with wbc count, blood glucose and content of ox-ldl which all serve as risk markers in pathogenesis of inflammation, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease (cvd).

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria for potential probiotic use  in iberian dry fermented sausages.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select lactic acid bacteria and bifibobacteria strains as potential probiotic cultures during the processing of iberian dry fermented sausages. a total of 1000 strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages (363), and human (337) and pig faeces (300) in different culture media. around 30% of these strains, mainly isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages in lamvab agar, were pre-selected for testing as potential probiotics by their ability to grow adequately at the ph values and nacl concentrations of these meat products during the ripening process. of the in vitro investigations used to predict the survival of a strain in conditions present in the gastro intestinal tract, exposure to ph 2.5 showed itself to be a  highly discriminating factor with only 51 out of 312 pre-selected strains resisting adequately after 1.5h of exposure. all acid-resistant isolates identified as lactobacilli originated from human faeces (lactobacillus casei and  lactobacillus fermentum) and pig faeces (lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus animalis, lactobacillus murinus, and lactobacillus vaginalis). pediococcus acidilactici strains were isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages and pig faeces, whereas the greatest number of enterococcus strains were identified as enterococcus faecium, with this species being isolated from iberian dry fermented sausages, and human and pig faeces. most of these strains are promising probiotic meat culture candidates suitable for iberian dry fermented sausages.

TI  == isolation and characterization of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces.
AB  == this study examined four lactobacilli isolated from pig feces. two hundred lactic acid bacteria strains were obtained from pig feces using selective culture media  (with vancomycin and bromocresol green; termed lamvab agar). microscopy, the catalase test, gram-staining, and rapd-pcr analysis were used to group the bacteria into 20 related clusters. phenotypic analysis using the api 50 ch test and genotypic analysis of 16s rdna sequences identified these clusters as representing single strains of each of lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus reuteri. bacterial survival under the conditions of low ph (2.0) and high concentration (5.0%, w/v)  of bile salt was much better than that of the reference strain (lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 33199). the isolated bacteria were quite capable of inhibiting the growth of two pathogens, escherichia coli k88 and salmonella typhimurium. the high acid-resistance, bile resistance and antagonism against pathogens, suggest that the four lactic acid bacteria isolated from pig feces could prove useful as  piglet probiotics.

TI  == rapid identification of the three major species of dairy obligate heterofermenters lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus  parabuchneri by species-specific duplex pcr.
AB  == in this study, the biodiversity of 154 strains of lactic acid bacteria, including 112 dairy product isolates presumptively identified as obligately heterofermentative lactobacilli (ohl) by classical microbiological tests, as well as 23 ohl-type strains, was investigated by pcr-based methods and gene sequencing. using these techniques, 51% of the cheese isolates were actually identified as ohl. the non-ohl isolates were identified to the leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weisella, pediococcus or streptococcus genera. among the ohl cheese isolates, five species were directly identified including three of the most frequently isolated species -lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus brevis- and two rarely isolated species - lactobacillus diolivorans and lactobacillus reuteri. a sixth group made up of two dairy isolates was also identified and according to 16s rrna gene and intergenic  spacer region (isr) sequencing data corresponded to lactobacillus sp. and may constitute a new species. species-specific primers were designed for the rapid and reliable detection of the three most frequently isolated species by species-specific duplex pcr.

TI  == comparative genome analysis of lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus fermentum  reveal a genomic island for reuterin and cobalamin production.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri is a heterofermentative lactic acid bacterium that naturally inhabits the gut of humans and other animals. the probiotic effects of  l. reuteri have been proposed to be largely associated with the production of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound reuterin during anaerobic metabolism of glycerol. we determined the complete genome sequences of the reuterin-producing l. reuteri jcm 1112(t) and its closely related species lactobacillus fermentum ifo 3956. both are in the same phylogenetic group within the genus lactobacillus. comparative genome analysis revealed that l. reuteri jcm 1112(t) has a unique cluster of 58 genes for the biosynthesis of reuterin and cobalamin (vitamin b(12)). the 58-gene cluster has a lower gc content and is apparently inserted into the conserved region, suggesting that the cluster represents a genomic island acquired from an anomalous source. two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2d-nmr) with (13)c(3)-glycerol demonstrated that l. reuteri jcm 1112(t) could convert glycerol to reuterin in vivo, substantiating the potential  of l. reuteri jcm 1112(t) to produce reuterin in the intestine. given that glycerol is shown to be naturally present in feces, the acquired ability to produce reuterin and cobalamin is an adaptive evolutionary response that likely contributes to the probiotic properties of l. reuteri.

TI  == lactobacillus equigenerosi sp. nov., a coccoid species isolated from faeces of thoroughbred racehorses.
AB  == two strains of lactic acid bacteria were isolated from faeces of two actively racing thoroughbred horses. the isolates formed a subcluster in the lactobacillus reuteri phylogenetic group, closely related to lactobacillus fermentum, l. gastricus, l. ingluviei and l. mucosae, by phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences. levels of dna-dna relatedness revealed that the isolates belonged to the same taxon and were genetically separated from their phylogenetic relatives. biochemical and physiological characteristics also distinguished the isolates from their phylogenetic relatives. the isolates produced spherical or oval cells, and tetrad-like cells were rarely seen. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of this morphological characteristic within the genus lactobacillus. thus, the isolates represent an atypical novel species of the genus lactobacillus, for which the name lactobacillus equigenerosi sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is nric 0697t (=jcm 14505t =dsm 18793t).

TI  == the adhesion of putative probiotic lactobacilli to cultured epithelial cells and  porcine intestinal mucus.
AB  == aims: to investigate the adhesion of lactobacilli and their subsequent competitive exclusion ability against pathogens. methods and results: four species of putative probiotic lactobacilli were studied for their adhesion abilities. first, the adhesion to caco-2 cells was examined by light and electron microscopy. the four species were then labelled by [methyl-(3)h] thymidine and their adhesion to porcine intestinal mucus was determined by radioactivity. the tested lactobacilli showed best adhesion on ileal mucus compared with duodenal and jejunal mucus. oxidative compound pre-treatment (naio(3) and naio(4)) dramatically decreased the adhesion of the lactobacilli to mucus. pre-treating mucus with proteolytic enzymes (proteinase k and trypsin) resulted in the increase of adhesion in lactobacillus serotype reuteri i2021, but the results in  the other species were variable. lactobacillus serotype fermentum i5007 showed greatest adhesion potential and exerted the best competitive exclusion against salmonella and escherichia. conclusions: adhesion ability in lactobacilli is species-specific. lactobacilli with higher adhesion index have better competitive exclusion ability. significance and impact of the study: this study suggests that there is a positive correlation between adhesion and competitive exclusion ability of lactobacilli. additionally, the in vitro adhesion assay is a feasible  way to screen unknown lactobacilli, potentially for future industrial applications.

TI  == evaluation in vitro of the antagonistic substances produced by lactobacillus spp. isolated from chickens.
AB  == to determine the inhibitory capacity of lactic acid bacteria due to the action of antagonistic substances, we tested 474 isolates of lactobacillus from the crop and cecum of chickens against gram-positive and gram-negative indicator microorganisms by the spot-on-the-lawn and well-diffusion antagonism methods. of  the 474 isolates, 265 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the indicator microorganisms. isolates identified as l. reuteri, l. salivarius, or lactobacillus spp. inhibited enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. but not l. casei, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, or l. helveticus by the well-diffusion simultaneous antagonism method  under anaerobic incubation conditions. the antagonistic substances produced by some of the lactobacillus isolates were inactivated after treatment by proteolytic enzymes, which suggested that the substances could be antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins.

TI  == species diversity and relative abundance of vaginal lactic acid bacteria from women in uganda and korea.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining vaginal health of women. the aim of this study was to compare the species richness and relative abundance  of lactobacillus and other lactic acid bacteria in women of two geographically distant countries, uganda and korea. methods and results: vaginal samples were obtained from two women populations in uganda and korea. the lactobacillus rogosa sl agar was used for initial isolation of lactic acid bacteria. after phenotypic  analyses, the 16s rrna gene was amplified by polymerase-chain reaction and analysed by the blast program and phylogenetic tree construction. a total of 338  (128 korean and 210 ugandan) vaginal lactic acid bacterial strains were isolated, including five genera: lactobacillus, leuconostoc, pediococcus, streptococcus and weissella. while lactobacillus crispatus was common in both populations, lactobacillus fermentum was common only in korean women, and lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus vaginalis only in ugandan women. among other lactic acid bacteria, weissella was more common in ugandan, and pediococcus in korean women. all weissella strains produced hydrogen peroxide, and all pediococcus strains inhibited candida species. conclusion: although many  lactic acid bacteria colonize women, their species distributions may be different in women of geographically separated communities. significance and impact of the  study: the knowledge of species richness and relative abundance of vaginal lactic acid bacteria, including lactobacillus, pediococcus and weissella, may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial replacement therapy.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility profiles of lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus fermentum.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus fermentum, which are commonly used as food processing aids and probiotics, can potentially act as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes. acquired resistance genes may be transferred via the food chain or in the gastrointestinal tract to pathogenic bacteria. knowledge of  the distributions of antibiotic mics for a species is needed when using a phenotypic method to assess the presence of acquired resistance genes. in the present study, 56 l. reuteri and 56 l. fermentum strains that differed by source  and spatial and temporal origin were assessed for antibiotic susceptibility using an etest kit and a broth microdilution protocol. l. fermentum strains displayed a uniform distribution of mics for all six antibiotics tested. l. reuteri strains had a bimodal distribution of mics or a distribution with mics above the test range for 7 of the 14 antibiotics tested. genetic relatedness was observed among  l. reuteri strains with high mics for both ampicillin and tetracycline and among  strains with high mics for both erythromycin and clindamycin. results obtained with the etest and the broth microdilution method corresponded well with each other. thus, further research may make it possible to define microbiological breakpoints for distinguishing between strains with and without acquired resistance genes.

TI  == a comparative study of the preventative effects exerted by two probiotics, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus fermentum, in the trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid model of rat colitis.
AB  == the intestinal anti-inflammatory effects of two probiotics isolated from breast milk, lactobacillus reuteri and l. fermentum, were evaluated and compared in the  trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (tnbs) model of rat colitis. colitis was induced in  rats by intracolonic administration of 10 mg tnbs dissolved in 50% ethanol (0.25  ml). either l. reuteri or l. fermentum was daily administered orally (5 x 10(8) colony-forming units suspended in 0.5 ml skimmed milk) to each group of rats (n 10) for 3 weeks, starting 2 weeks before colitis induction. colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically, and the colonic luminal contents were used for bacterial studies and for scfa production. both probiotics showed intestinal anti-inflammatory effects in this model of experimental colitis, as evidenced histologically and by a significant reduction of colonic myeloperoxidase activity (p<0.05). l. fermentum significantly counteracted the colonic glutathione depletion induced by the inflammatory process. in addition, both probiotics lowered colonic tnfalpha levels (p<0.01) and inducible no synthase expression when compared with non-treated rats; however, the decrease in colonic cyclo-oxygenase-2 expression was only achieved with l.fermentum administration. finally, the two probiotics induced the growth of lactobacilli species in comparison with control colitic rats, but the production of scfa in colonic contents was only increased when l. fermentum was given. in conclusion, l. fermentum can exert beneficial immunomodulatory properties in inflammatory bowel disease, being more effective than l. reuteri, a probiotic with reputed efficacy in promoting beneficial effects on human health.

TI  == activity of hiv entry and fusion inhibitors expressed by the human vaginal colonizing probiotic lactobacillus reuteri rc-14.
AB  == novel therapeutic approaches are needed to combat the rapid increase in hiv sexual transmission in women. the probiotic organism lactobacillus reuteri rc-14  which safely colonizes the human vagina and prevents microbial infections, has been genetically modified to produce anti-hiv proteins which were capable of blocking the three main steps of hiv entry into human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. the hiv entry or fusion inhibitors were fused to the native expression and secretion signals of bspa, mlp or sep in l. reuteri rc-14 and the  expression cassettes were stably inserted into the chromosome. l. reuteri rc-14 expressed the hiv inhibitors in cell wall-associated and secreted forms. l. reuteri rc-14 expressing cd4d1d2-antibody-like fusion proteins were able to bind  single or dual tropic coreceptor-using hiv-1 primary isolates. this is the first  study to show that a well-documented and proven human vaginal probiotic strain can express potent functional viral inhibitors, which may potentially lower the sexual transmission of hiv.

TI  == probiotics for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: a review of the evidence from microbiological and clinical studies.
AB  == recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) afflict a great number of women around  the world. the use of probiotics, especially lactobacilli, has been considered for the prevention of utis. since lactobacilli dominate the urogenital flora of healthy premenopausal women, it has been suggested that restoration of the urogenital flora, which is dominated by uropathogens, with lactobacilli may protect against utis. this review is based on a search of pubmed for relevant articles. many in vitro studies, animal experiments, microbiological studies in healthy women, and clinical trials in women with utis have been carried out to assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for prophylaxis against uropathogens. most of them had encouraging findings for some specific strains of  lactobacilli. lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 (previously called l. fermentum rc-14) seemed to be the most effective among the studied lactobacilli for the prevention of utis. l. casei shirota and l. crispatus ctv-05 have also shown efficacy in some studies. l. rhamnosus gg did not appear to be quite as effective in the prevention of utis. the evidence from the available studies suggests that probiotics can be beneficial for preventing recurrent utis  in women; they also have a good safety profile. however, further research is needed to confirm these results before the widespread use of probiotics for this  indication can be recommended.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr analysis of fecal lactobacillus species in infants receiving a prebiotic infant formula.
AB  == the developing intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants is considered to play  an important role in the priming of the infants' mucosal and systemic immunity. generally, bifidobacterium and lactobacillus predominate the microbiota of breast-fed infants. in intervention trials it has been shown that lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on, for example, diarrhea and atopy. however, the lactobacillus species distribution in breast-fed or formula-fed infants has not yet been determined in great detail. for accurate enumeration of different lactobacilli, duplex 5' nuclease assays, targeted on rrna intergenic spacer regions, were developed for lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the  designed and validated assays were used to determine the amounts of different lactobacillus species in fecal samples of infants receiving a standard formula (sf) or a standard formula supplemented with galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9:1 ratio (osf). a breast-fed group (bf) was studied in parallel as a reference. during the 6-week intervention period a significant increase was shown in total percentage of fecal lactobacilli in the bf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.1% +/- 1.5%) and the osf group (0.8% +/- 0.3% versus 4.4% +/- 1.4%). the lactobacillus species distribution in the osf group was comparable to breast-fed  infants, with relatively high levels of l. acidophilus, l. paracasei, and l. casei. the sf-fed infants, on the other hand, contained more l. delbrueckii and less l. paracasei compared to breast-fed infants and osf-fed infants. an infant milk formula containing a specific mixture of prebiotics is able to induce a microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of bf infants.

TI  == growth of lactic acid bacteria and rhizopus oligosporus during barley tempeh fermentation.
AB  == the zygomycete rhizopus oligosporus is traditionally used to ferment soybean tempeh, but it is also possible to ferment other legumes and cereals to tempeh. the traditional soybean tempeh harbours a multitude of microorganisms with potentially beneficial or detrimental effects on quality. lactic acid bacteria (lab) have positive effects on the safety of soybean tempeh, but the effects of lab on r. oligosporus growth have not been investigated. we have developed a cereal grain tempeh by fermenting pearled barley with r. oligosporus atcc 64063.  four lab species, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri and lactococcus lactis were assessed for their growth abilities and their effects on r. oligosporus growth during barley tempeh fermentation. growth of lab was assayed as colony forming units (cfu), while growth of r. oligosporus was measured as ergosterol content and hyphal length. the two fungal measurements highly correlated (r=0.83, p<0.001, n=90). the ergosterol content of fungal mycelia ranged from 11.7 to 30.1 mg/g fungal dry matter. l. plantarum multiplied  from 4.8 to 7.4 log cfu/g dry tempeh and l. fermentum increased from 4.4 to 6.8 log cfu/g during 24 h incubation at 35 degrees c. l. reuteri and l. lactis had significantly slower growth, with increases from 4.8 to 5.6 log cfu/g and 5.0 to  5.4 log cfu/g, respectively. the growth of r. oligosporus and the final ph (4.9)  in barley tempeh were not significantly influenced by any of the lab investigated.

TI  == glucan synthesis in the genus lactobacillus: isolation and characterization of glucansucrase genes, enzymes and glucan products from six different strains.
AB  == members of the genera streptococcus and leuconostoc synthesize various alpha-glucans (dextran, alternan and mutan). in lactobacillus, until now, the only glucosyltransferase (gtf) enzyme that has been characterized is gtfa of lactobacillus reuteri 121, the first gtf enzyme synthesizing a glucan (reuteran)  that contains mainly alpha-(1-->4) linkages together with alpha-(1-->6) and alpha-(1-->4,6) linkages. recently, partial sequences of glucansucrase genes were detected in other members of the genus lactobacillus. this paper reports, for the first time, isolation and characterization of dextransucrase and mutansucrase genes and enzymes from various lactobacillus species and the characterization of  the glucan products synthesized, which mainly have alpha-(1-->6)- and alpha-(1-->3)-glucosidic linkages. the four gtf enzymes characterized from three  different lb. reuteri strains are highly similar at the amino acid level, and consequently their protein structures are very alike. interestingly, these four lb. reuteri gtfs have relatively large n-terminal variable regions, containing rdv repeats, and relatively short putative glucan-binding domains with conserved  and less-conserved yg-repeating units. the three other gtf enzymes, isolated from lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus parabuchneri, contain smaller variable regions and larger putative glucan-binding domains compared to the lb. reuteri gtf enzymes.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == peptide surface display and secretion using two lpxtg-containing surface proteins from lactobacillus fermentum br11.
AB  == a locus encoding two repetitive proteins that have lpxtg cell wall anchoring signals from lactobacillus fermentum br11 has been identified by using an antiserum raised against whole l. fermentum br11 cells. the first protein, rlp, is similar to the rib surface protein from streptococcus agalactiae, while the other protein, mlp, is similar to the mucus binding protein mub from lactobacillus reuteri. it was shown that multiple copies of mlp exist in the genome of l. fermentum br11. regions of rlp, mlp, and the previously characterized surface protein bspa were used to surface display or secrete heterologous peptides in l. fermentum. the peptides tested were 10 amino acids of the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein and a six-histidine epitope (his(6)). the bspa promoter and secretion signal were used in combination with the rlp cell wall sorting signal to express, export, and covalently anchor the heterologous peptides to the cell wall. detection of the cell surface protein fusions revealed that rlp was a significantly better surface display vector than  bspa despite having lower cellular levels (0.7 mg per liter for the rlp fusion compared with 4 mg per liter for the bspa fusion). the mlp promoter and encoded secretion signal were used to express and export large (328-kda at 10 mg per liter) and small (27-kda at 0.06 mg per liter) amino-terminal fragments of the mlp protein fused to the his(6) and cftr peptides or his(6) peptide, respectively. therefore, these newly described proteins from l. fermentum br11 have potential as protein production and targeting vectors.

AB  == four sourdoughs (a to d) were produced under practical conditions by using a starter mixture of three commercially available sourdough starters and a baker's  yeast constitutively containing various species of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the sourdoughs were continuously propagated until the composition of the lab flora remained stable. two lab-specific pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) systems were established and used to monitor the development of the microflora. depending on the prevailing ecological conditions  in the different sourdough fermentations, only a few lactobacillus species were found to be competitive and became dominant. in sourdough a (traditional process  with rye flour), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and a new species, l. mindensis,  were detected. in rye flour sourdoughs b and c, which differed in the process temperature, exclusively l. crispatus and l. pontis became the predominant species in sourdough b and l. crispatus, l. panis, and l. frumenti became the predominant species in sourdough c. on the other hand, in sourdough d (corresponding to sourdough c but produced with rye bran), l. johnsonii and l. reuteri were found. the results of pcr-dgge were consistent with those obtained by culturing, except for sourdough b, in which l. fermentum was also detected. isolates of the species l. sanfranciscensis and l. fermentum were shown by randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr analysis to originate from the commercial  starters and the baker's yeast, respectively.

AB  == a homo-tetrameric approximately 160-kda cystathionine gamma-lyase was purified to homogeneity from lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016 by four chromatographic steps. the activity was pyridoxal-5'-phosphate dependent and the enzyme catalyzed the alpha,gamma-elimination reaction of l-cystathionine, producing l-cysteine, ammonia and alpha-ketobutyrate. the enzyme was active towards a range of amino acids and amino acid derivatives, including methionine. the ph and temperature optima were found to be 8.0 and 35 degrees c. respectively. isoelectric ph (pi) was approximately 5.0 as determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis. sensitivity to chemical inhibitors was typical of lactococcal cystathionine gamma- and beta-lyases, except it was inhibited by sulphydryl reagents. the n-terminal sequence was mkfntqlihggnsed, which had 100% homology with cystathionine beta-lyase of lb. reuteri 104r (accession number (cac05298). lb. reuteri dsm 20016. together with 10 other strains of non-starter lactic acid bacteria, was used as adjunct starter in the production of miniature ('anestrato  pugliese-like cheeses. after 40 d ripening, the water-soluble extract of the cheeses with added lactobacillus fermentum dt41 and lb. reuteri dsm 20016 contained the highest enzyme activities on cystathionine and methionine substrates. determinations of methanethiol, dimethyl sulphide, dimethyl disulphide and dimethyl trisulphide in the miniature cheeses confirmed the findings of enzyme activities.

AB  == aims: the overall growth kinetics of four potentially probiotic strains (lactobacillus fermentum, lact. reuteri, lact. acidophilus and lact. plantarum) cultured in malt, barley and wheat media were investigated. the objectives were to identify the main factors influencing the growth and metabolic activity of each strain in association with the cereal substrate. methods and results: all fermentations were performed without ph control. a logistic-type equation, which  included a growth inhibition term, was used to describe the experimental data. in the malt medium, all strains attained high maximum cell populations (8.10-10.11 log10 cfu ml(-1), depending on the strain), probably due to the availability of maltose, sucrose, glucose, fructose (approx. 15 g l(-1) total fermentable sugars) and free amino nitrogen (approx. 80 mg l(-1)). the consumption of sugars during the exponential phase (10-12 h) resulted in the accumulation of lactic acid (1.06-1.99 g l(-1)) and acetic acid (0.29-0.59 g l(-1)), which progressively decreased the ph of the medium. each strain demonstrated a specific preference for one or more sugars. since small amounts of sugars were consumed by the end of the exponential phase (17-43%), the decisive growth-limiting factor was probably  the ph, which at that time ranged between 3.40 and 3.77 for all of the strains. analysis of the metabolic products confirmed the heterofermentative or homofermentative nature of the strains used, except in the case of lact. acidophilus which demonstrated a shift towards the heterofermentative pathway. all strains produced acetic acid during the exponential phase, which could be attributed to the presence of oxygen. lactobacillus plantarum, lact. reuteri and  lact. fermentum continued to consume the remaining sugars and accumulate metabolic products in the medium, probably due to energy requirements for cell viability, while lact. acidophilus entered directly into the decline phase. in the barley and wheat media all strains, especially lact. acidophilus and lact. reuteri, attained lower maximum cell populations (7.20-9.43 log10 cfu ml(-1)) than in the malt medium. this could be attributed to the low sugar content (3-4 g l(-1) total fermentable sugar for each medium) and the low free amino nitrogen concentration (15.3-26.6 mg l(-1)). in all fermentations, the microbial growth ceased at ph values (3.73-4.88, depending on the strain) lower than those observed for malt fermentations, which suggests that substrate deficiency in sugars and free amino nitrogen contributed to growth limitation. conclusions: the malt medium supported the growth of all strains more than barley and wheat media  due to its chemical composition, while lact. plantarum and lact. fermentum appeared to be less fastidious and more resistant to acidic conditions than lact. acidophilus and lact. reuteri. significance and impact of the study: cereals are  suitable substrates for the growth of potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei in a murine model of escherichia coli urinary tract infection.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of the intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei strain shirota against escherichia coli in a murine urinary tract infection (uti) model was examined. uti was induced by intraurethral administration of escherichia coli strain hu-1 (a clinical isolate from a uti patient, positive for type 1 and p fimbriae), at a dose of 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) cfu in 20 microl of saline, into a c3h/hen mouse bladder which had been traumatized with 0.1 n hcl followed immediately by neutralization with 0.1 n naoh 24 h before the challenge infection. chronic infection with the pathogen at 10(6) cfu in the urinary tract (bladder and kidneys) was maintained for more than 3 weeks after the challenge, and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and myeloperoxidase activity in the urine were markedly elevated during the infection period. a single administration of l. casei shirota at a dose of 10(8) cfu 24 h before the challenge infection dramatically inhibited e. coli growth and inflammatory responses in the urinary tract. multiple daily treatments with l. casei shirota during the postinfection period also showed antimicrobial activity  in this uti model. a heat-killed preparation of l. casei shirota exerted significant antimicrobial effects not only with a single pretreatment (100 microg/mouse) but also with multiple daily treatments during the postinfection period. the other lactobacillus strains tested, i.e., l. fermentum atcc 14931(t), l. jensenii atcc 25258(t), l. plantarum atcc 14917(t), and l. reuteri jcm 1112(t), had no significant antimicrobial activity. taken together, these results suggest that the probiotic l. casei strain shirota is a potent therapeutic agent  for uti.

TI  == rapid pcr-based procedure to identify lactic acid bacteria: application to six common lactobacillus species.
AB  == the goal of this study was to develop a method allowing rapid identification of the lactic acid bacteria strains in use in the laboratory (lactobacillus plantarum ncimb8826; l. fermentum kld; l. reuteri 100-23; l. salivarius ucc43321; l. paracasei lbtgs1.4; l. casei atcc393), based on pcr amplification of 16s rna coding sequences. first, specific forward oligonucleotides were designed in the variable regions of 16s rna coding sequences of six lactobacillus strains. the reverse oligonucleotide was designed in the region where the sequences were homologous for the six strains. the expected size of the amplification product was +/-1000 bp. the specificity of the method was tested on total chromosomal dna. for five out of the six strains, the amplification of the fragment was strain-specific and the method was directly applicable to colonies. for the strain l. casei atcc393, an additional argument to the classification of this bacteria in the paracasei group could be proposed. validation of the developed method was performed by applying it to six lactobacillus reference strains and to various species of bacteria.

TI  == purification and characterization of a surface-binding protein from lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 that inhibits adhesion of enterococcus faecalis 1131.
AB  == lactobacilli have been shown to be important in the maintenance of the healthy urogenital flora. one strain, lactobacillus fermentum rc-14, releases surface-active components which can inhibit adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria. using a quantitative method for determining inhibition of adhesion, a protein with high anti-adhesive properties against enterococcus faecalis 1131 was purified. the n-terminal sequence of the 29-kda protein was identical to that of  a collagen-binding protein from lactobacillus reuteri ncib 11951, and exhibited close homology with a basic surface protein from l. fermentum br11. the results suggest that this anti-adhesive cell surface protein of lactobacillus could protect against uropathogens by preventing their adhesion. the federation of european microbiological societies.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == lactobacillus mucosae sp. nov., a new species with in vitro mucus-binding activity isolated from pig intestine.
AB  == a new lactobacillus species from pig small intestine has been identified. in an attempt to isolate lactobacillus reuteri strains carrying the putative colonization-factor gene (mub, for mucus binding) a mub-derived gene probe was used to screen pig intestinal material. a number of isolates were obtained and primary characterization showed that they were gram-positive, catalase-negative,  non-spore-forming, non-motile rods. growth occurred at 45 degrees c but not at 15 degrees c and the dna g+c content was 46 mol%. cell wall analysis together with dna-dna hybridization and analysis of the 16s rrna sequence revealed that the new isolates represent a previously undescribed lactobacillus species closely related to l. reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus pontis. the name lactobacillus mucosae is proposed for this species and the type strain is s32t.

TI  == strain-dependent induction of cytokine profiles in the gut by orally administered lactobacillus strains.
AB  == different lactobacillus strains are frequently used in consumer food products. in addition, recombinant lactobacilli which contain novel expression vectors can now be used in immunotherapeutic applications such as oral vaccination strategies and in t cell tolerance induction approaches for autoimmune disease. both for food and clinical applications of lactobacilli, proper selection of wild type strains  is crucial. for that purpose, eight different common lactobacillus strains were analysed with respect to mucosal induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, iga-producing plasma cells in the gut, as well as systemic antibody responses against a parenterally administered antigen. immunohistochemical analysis of cytokine-producing cells in the gut villi showed no significant induction of the cytokines il-1alpha, ifn-gamma, il-4 or il-10 after oral administration of wild type lactobacillus strains. in contrast, oral administration of l. reuteri and l. brevis induced expression of the proinflammatory/th1 cytokines tnf-alpha, il-2 and/or il-1beta. oral administration of these two strains and l. fermentum also significantly enhanced  the igg response against parenterally administered haptenated chicken gamma globulin (tnp-cgg). the five other strains did not show this adjuvanticity. l. reuteri induced relatively high levels of igg2a compared to l. murines, a nonadjuving lactobacillus strain. these findings imply that different lactobacillus strains induce distinct mucosal cytokine profiles and possess differential intrinsic adjuvanticity. this suggests that rational lactobacillus strain selection provides a strategy to influence cytokine expression and thereby influence immune responses.

TI  == differentiation of lactobacillus isolates from infant faeces by sds-page and rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  == isolates of lactobacilli from infant faeces phenotypically characterized as lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (six strains), lact. rhamnosus (six strains), lact. gasseri (three strains), lact. acidophilus (one strain) and lact. fermentum/reuteri (three strains) according to recent classification systems were subjected to sds-page of whole cell proteins and rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probe hybridization, in order to confirm the phenotypic characterization and elucidate the exact taxonomic position of the three strains that had properties between fermentum and reuteri. results suggested a good agreement between the phenotypic characterization, sds-page and rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probe hybridization for strains of all species except for the lact. fermentum/reuteri strains. results obtained by rrna probes suggested a possible phylogenetic relatedness of the strains to lact. reuteri. isolates from infant faeces with interesting probiotic properties could be used as components of fermented milk products.

TI  == the identification of vaginal lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal dna probes to 20 american type culture collection lactobacillus strains. most women were colonized by l. crispatus (32%), followed by l. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated l. 1086v (15%), l. gasseri (5%), l. fermentum (0.3%), l. oris (0.3%), l. reuteri  (0.3%), l. ruminis (0.3%), and l. vaginalis (0.3%). h2o2 was produced by 95% of l. crispatus and 94% of l. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of l. 1086v.  colonization by l. crispatus or l. jensenii was positively associated with being  white (p<.001), age >/=20 years (p=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (p=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (p<.001) and gonorrhea (p=.03). l. crispatus and l. jensenii, not l. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.

TI  == antagonistic activity of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus species from ogi,  an indigenous fermented food.
AB  == seven lactobacillus species each with one or more strains were isolated from various fermented cereal gruel's (ogi). they were identified as l. plantarum (3 strains), l. delbrueckii (1 strain), l. brevis (2 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. casei (1 strain), l. fermentum (1 strain) and l. acidophilus (1 strain). bacteriocin production was observed in cell-free supernatants of 8 of these strains with l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii and l. reuteri strains (white maize ogi) being negative. the bacteriocin produced by the eight strains inhibited the growth of various target organisms with the inhibition strongly noticed using enterococcus faecalis as indicator. while catalase treatment, ph changes and heat treatment up to 80 degrees c had no effect on the activity of bacteriocin from these isolates, treatment with trypsin and proteinase k resulted in complete loss of inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins. a reduction in the inhibitory activity of the bacteriocins was also found to occur with increasing concentrations of glucose or peptone in the cultivation medium.

TI  == cloning of erythromycin-resistance determinants and replication origins from indigenous plasmids of lactobacillus reuteri for potential use in construction of cloning vectors.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri l1 and n16 strains contain a 7.0-kb plasmid (pte80) and a 15-kb plasmid (pte15), respectively, encoding resistance to erythromycin (em(r)). physical maps of both plasmids were established. nucleotide sequences of the genetic determinants encoding em(r) on pte80 and pte15 revealed the existence of  a very similar (ca. 99% nucleotide sequence and ca. 98% amino acid sequence identity) open reading frame for an em(r) transmethylase gene (erm) in both plasmids. these structural erm genes, 753 and 750 bp in length, respectively, were highly related (ca. 98% nucleotide sequence and ca. 97% amino acid sequence  identity) to the erm gene of l. fermentum plasmid plem3. sequence analysis showed that these two erm genes from pte80 and pte15 could be categorized under the ermb (ermam) class. these are the first members of the ermb (ermam) class of em(r) determinant from l. reuteri to be characterized at the nucleotide sequence level. the em(r) gene from pte80 (erm80) was then ligated into puc18/19 to construct replication origin (ro)-screening vectors pue80(+) and pue80(-) (pue80(+/-)). these plasmids contain the puc18/19-derived multiple cloning site, ampicillin-resistance trait, and the lacz' gene, which enable direct screening for recombinants in escherichia coli. once the recombinant contains a ro from l.  reuteri, the em(r) trait of erm80 is used as a selection marker for the replication of the chimeric plasmid as it is transformed into l. reuteri using the cloned ro as a replicon. replication regions from pte80 and pte15 were successfully cloned into the constructed vector pue80(-). the ro cloned from pte80 was further identified as being highly stable in l. reuteri and also bearing a relatively narrow host range compared with that of pte15. the em(r) determinant (erm80) and ro cloned from pte80 could be used in the future construction of derivatives of cloning vectors for this microbe. moreover, the pue80(+/-) and pte80-ro constructed in this study have the potential to be developed as a suicide vector and an e. coli-l. reuteri shuttle vector, respectively.

TI  == use of conserved randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) fragments and rapd pattern for characterization of lactobacillus fermentum in ghanaian fermented maize dough.
AB  == the present work describes the use of randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) for the characterization of 172 dominant lactobacillus isolates from present and  previous studies of ghanaian maize fermentation. heterofermentative lactobacilli  dominate the fermentation flora, since approximately 85% of the isolates belong to this group. cluster analysis of the rapd profiles obtained showed the presence of two main clusters. cluster 1 included lactobacillus fermentum, whereas cluster 2 comprised the remaining lactobacillus spp. the two distinct clusters emerged at the similarity level of <50%. all isolates in cluster 1 showed similarity in their rapd profile to the reference strains of l. fermentum included in the study. these isolates, yielding two distinct bands of approximately 695 and 773 bp with the primers used, were divided into four subclusters, indicating that several strains are involved in the fermentation and remain dominant throughout the process. the two distinct rapd fragments were cloned, sequenced, and used as  probes in southern hybridization experiments. with one exception, lactobacillus reuteri lmg 13045, the probes hybridized only to fragments of different sizes in  ecori-digested chromosomal dna of l. fermentum strains, thus indicating the specificity of the probes and variation within the l. fermentum isolates.

TI  == the bspa locus of lactobacillus fermentum br11 encodes an l-cystine uptake system.
AB  == bspa is a basic surface-exposed protein from lactobacillus fermentum br11. sequence comparisons have shown that it is a member of family iii of the solute binding proteins. it is 89% identical to the collagen binding protein, cnb, from  lactobacillus reuteri. compared with the database of escherichia coli proteins, bspa is most similar to the l-cystine binding protein fliy. to investigate the function of bspa, mutants depleted for bspa were generated by homologous recombination with a temperature-sensitive plasmid. these mutants were significantly impaired in their abilities to take up l-cystine. uptake rates of l-glutamine, l-histidine, and l-lysine, which are substrates for other binding proteins with similarity to bspa, were unaffected. evidence was obtained that bspa is necessary for maximal resistance to oxidative stress. specifically, inactivation of bspa causes defective growth in the presence of oxygen and sensitivity to paraquat. measurements of sulfhydryl levels showed that incubation of l. fermentum br11 with l-cystine resulted in increased levels of sulfhydryl groups both inside and outside the cell; however, this was not the case with a bspa mutant. the role of bspa as an extracellular matrix protein adhesin was also addressed. l. fermentum br11 does not bind to immobilized type i collagen or laminin above background levels but does bind immobilized fibronectin. inactivation of bspa did not significantly affect fibronectin binding; therefore, we have not found evidence to support the notion that bspa is an extracellular matrix protein binding adhesin. as bspa is most probably not a lipoprotein, this  report provides evidence that gram-positive bacterial solute binding proteins do  not necessarily have to be anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane to function in solute uptake.

TI  == antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
AB  == forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.

TI  == characterization of the bacterial flora of sudanese sorghum flour and sorghum sourdough.
AB  == the microflora of a sudanese sorghum flour, a spontaneously fermented sourdough and a long-term sourdough produced in a sudanese household by consecutive re-inoculations, was studied. the dominant contaminants of sorghum flour were gram-negative, catalase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria with counts of about 10(5)  cfu g-1. the spontaneously fermented sorghum sourdough showed a bacterial succession from gram-negative, catalase-positive contaminants to enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus fermentum and lact. reuteri. the total bacterial count reached about 10(10) cfu g-1 and the ph dropped from 6.4 to 3.35 in about 42 h. in this phase, only the latter two species remained dominant  in a ratio of 1:1. from the sudanese long-term dough, seven strains of lactobacillus were isolated, representing the dominant flora. sequence comparison of partial 16s rrna gene sequences were used to clarify their phylogenetic positions. five strains were classified as lact. vaginalis and could be regarded  as heterogeneous biovars of this species. the other two strains could be assigned to lact. helveticus. rapd-pcr and sugar fermentation patterns were useful in differentiation of these strains.

TI  == electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases, a new tool for bacterial species identification: application to 10 lactobacillus species.
AB  == lactobacilli have been used as industrial starters for a long time, but in many cases their phenotypic identification is still neither easy nor reliable. previously we observed that the cell wall peptidoglycan hydrolases of lactobacillus helveticus were highly conserved enzymes; the aim of the present work was to determine whether peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns obtained by renaturing sds-page could be of interest in the identification of lactobacilli species. for that purpose, the peptidoglycan hydrolase patterns of 94 strains of  lactobacilli belonging to 10 different species were determined; most of the species studied are used either in dairy, meat, bakery or vegetable fermentations: l. helveticus, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii, l. brevis, l. fermentum, l. jensenii, l. plantarum, l. sake, l. curvatus and l. reuteri. within a species, the strains exhibited highly similar patterns: the apparent molecular  weights of the lytic bands were identical, with only slight variations of intensity. moreover, each species, including phylogenetically close species such  as l. sake and l. curvatus, or l. acidophilus and l. helveticus, gave a different pattern. interestingly, the closer the species were phylogenetically, the more related were their patterns. the sensitivity of the method was checked using various quantities of l. acidophilus cells: a peptidoglycan hydrolase extract of  5 x 10(6) cells was sufficient to obtain an informative pattern, as was a single  colony. finally, the method was also successfully applied to distinguish two carnobacterium species. in conclusion, the electrophoretic pattern of peptidoglycan hydrolases is proposed as a new tool for lactobacilli identification: it is rapid, sensitive and effective even for phylogenetically close species. furthermore, this work provides the first evidence of the potential overall taxonomic value of bacterial peptidoglycan hydrolases.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus supplementation with and without arginine on liver damage and bacterial translocation in an acute liver injury model in the rat.
AB  == in acute liver failure following hepatitis, toxic insults, or after major liver surgery, there is an increased bacterial translocation from the gut. this may explain some of the infectious complications seen in these conditions. to elucidate mechanisms and find possible preventive measures, we investigated the effect of rectal administration of arginine and probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus spp.) on bacterial translocation and the extent of liver failure. sprague-dawley  rats were used and five different lactobacillus strains (lb. reuteri r2lc, lb. rhamnosus dsm 6594 (= strain 271), lb. plantarum dsm 9843 (= strain 299v), lb. fermentum 8704:3 (= strain 245), and lb. reuteri (= strain 108) were administered rectally once daily for 8 days with and without 2% arginine. acute liver injury (ali) was induced on the eighth day by intraperitoneal injection of d-galactosamine (1.1 g/kg body weight), and samples were collected after 24 and 48 hours. bacterial translocation was evaluated by bacterial culture from portal  and arterial blood, mesenteric lymph nodes, and liver tissue. liver enzymes and bilirubin were evaluated in the serum. the bacterial load in the cecum and colon  was determined and the liver histopathological changes were studied. there was no mortality at any time. the liver enzymes and bilirubin decreased in some of the groups supplemented with lactobacilli with and without arginine compared with the ali control group. the incidence of bacterial translocation and the number of the translocated bacteria decreased significantly in some of the supplemented groups. lb. plantarum + arginine administration significantly reduced the level of the released liver enzymes, hepatocellular necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration, bacterial translocation, and the number of enterobacteriaceae in the cecum and colon. rectal administration of different lactobacillus strains with and without arginine in an ali model significantly modulates the extent of the liver failure and reduces bacterial translocation. lb. plantarum dsm 9843 (=  strain 299v) with or without arginine seemed superior to the other lactobacillus  strains. the beneficial effect of arginine administration alone indicates a possible role of nitric oxide and polyamines in this process, and the lactobacilli may execute their action via the same mechanisms or via bacterial antagonism and/or enhancement of systemic and intestinal mucosal immunity.

AB  == a total of 241 lactic acid bacteria belonging to lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus fermentum/reuteri and lactobacillus brevis from various processing stages of maize dough fermentation were investigated. results indicated that each processing stage has its own microenvironment with strong antimicrobial activity. about half of the lact. plantarum and practically  all of the lact. fermentum/reuteri investigated were shown to inhibit other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, explaining the elimination of these organisms during the initial processing stages. further, widespread microbial interactions amounting to 85% to 18% of all combinations tested were demonstrated amongst lactic acid bacteria within the various processing stages, i.e. raw material, steeping, 0 h and 48 h of fermentation, explaining the microbial succession taking place amongst lactic acid bacteria during fermentation. the antimicrobial effect was explained by the combined effect of acids, compounds sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and other compounds with antimicrobial activity  with the acid production being the most important factor. the pattern of antimicrobial factors was not species-specific and the safety and storage stability of fermented maize seem to depend on a mixed population of lactic acid  bacteria with different types of antimicrobial characteristics. this means that introduction of pure cultures as starters may impose a risk to the product.

AB  == quantitative differences in the content of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the content of the stomach, small and large intestine have been established when studying microflora of the gastrointestinal tract of minks kept in the 30-kilometer zone of the chernobyl npp (experimental animals) and at the cherkassy fur farm (control animals). obligate heterofermentative species of lactic acid bacteria related to lactobacillus fermentum and l. reuteri prevailed  in the stomach of experimental minks. species composition of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the stomach of the cherkassy minks is characterized by the availability of both obligate and facultative heterofermentative species of bacteria--l. bavaricus, l. coryniformis, l. reuteri and of obligate homofermentative bacteria--l. salivarius and l. jensenii. in limiting dilutions (10(-9)-10(-10)) of the content of small intestine of the control minks one could find bacteria of l. coryniformis species and representatives of obligate heterofermentative bacteria--l. confusus and l. fermentum that is 1-2 orders higher then in the experimental minks. both lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria (the latter up to 10(+9) cells/g of the content) were isolated from the lower departments of small and large intestine of the chernobyl and cherkassy minks. among the species of lactic acid bacteria isolated from the experimental animals homofermentative species (l. acidophilus, l. sharpeae) and,  heterofermentative (l. confusus, l. fermentum) in the control were found.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == identification of lactobacilli from sourdough and description of lactobacillus pontis sp. nov.
AB  == the microflora of sourdough preparations was investigated by examining the physiological characteristics, whole-cell protein patterns, and 16s rrna sequences of lactobacillus isolates. strains isolated from sourdough were placed  in the species lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus sanfrancisco, and lactobacillus reuteri. 16s rrna sequences were determined for l. brevis, lactobacillus fructivorans, lactobacillus fermentum, l. sanfrancisco, and l. reuteri, and oligonucleotide probes for fast specific identification of these sourdough lactobacilli were deduced. the physiological characteristics, protein patterns, and 16s rrna sequences of these organisms were compared with data for other sourdough lactobacilli and additional reference strains. strains of a lactobacillus species were isolated from rye sourdough; these strains may account for most of the flora in sourdough made from wheat or rye. these organisms were differentiated from other sourdough lactobacilli by their protein pattern, 16s rrna sequence, g + c content, and physiological properties. the 16s rrna sequence of this species was determined, and we constructed a phylogenetic tree which reflected the relationships of this species to other lactobacilli. this organism  is closely related to l. reuteri. a new lactobacillus species, lactobacillus pontis, is proposed. the type strain is l. pontis lth 2587 (= dsm 8475 = lmg 14187). we describe a general strategy in which a polyphasic approach was used to characterize a new species.

TI  == characterization and frequency distribution of species of lactic acid bacteria involved in the processing of mawe, a fermented maize dough from benin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria involved in the natural fermentation of both home-produced and commercial mawe were investigated during a 72 h fermentation period. lactobacillus spp. constitute the majority (94%) of the strains of the lactic acid bacteria isolated, among which 89% represent the betabacterium group. they include l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) (41%), l. fermentum or l. reuteri (19%), l. brevis (26%), l. confusus (less than 2%), l. curvatus (less than 1%) and l. buchneri (less than 1%). other isolated lactic acid bacteria were l. salivarius, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, pediococcus acidilactici and leuconostoc mesenteroides. several species were detected at the early stage of fermentation, but the final stage was dominated by l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) and l. fermentum or l. reuteri totalling 90% of the isolated strains. the trend was the same for both home-produced and commercial mawe. no strains of l. plantarum, generally reported as dominating lactic acid bacteria at the final stage of fermentation of most plant foods, were isolated.

TI  == binding of lactobacillus reuteri to fibronectin immobilized on glass beads.
AB  == human fibronectin was immobilized on glass beads. the beads were used to evaluate binding of lactobacillus reuteri to fibronectin. organisms bound to the glass beads were detected using fluorescence microscopy after treatment with acridine orange. this binding was confirmed and quantified with the use of [3h]-labelled organisms. three strains of lactobacillus reuteri, three strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and one strain of lactobacillus fermentum were tested for binding capacity. l. reuteri strain 1063 exhibited a strong binding to the immobilized fibronectin, and l. acidophilus 1754 showed a slight binding. the binding of l. reuteri to the fibronectin was mediated by a protein as judged by the absence of  binding after treatment of the bacteria with proteolytic enzymes. treatment of the bacteria with urea, sds and heat (80 degrees c) also reduced binding. treatment of the bacterial cells prior to the assay with fibronectin interfered with binding. albumin did not show this interaction.

TI  == single-stranded dna plasmid, vector construction and cloning of bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase in lactobacillus.
AB  == vector plasmids were constructed by ligating chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance genes to taqi-digested dna of a cryptic plasmid from lactobacillus plantarum. the minimal region of lactobacillus plasmid dna that was required for  dna replication was defined and a single-stranded dna intermediate replication system was observed. homologies with other origins of replication of plasmids from gram-positive bacteria, replicating via rolling circle mechanism, were found. it was shown that the constructed vectors, named ppsc20 and ppsc22, were transformable into l. plantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. using plasmid ppsc22, the alpha-amylase gene of bacillus stearothermophilus was cloned and expressed in several lactobacillus species.

TI  == conjugal transfer of plasmid pam beta 1 in lactobacillus reuteri and between lactobacilli and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == the broad-host-range plasmid pam beta 1 (erythromycin resistance) was transferred conjugally from streptococcus lactis to lactobacillus reuteri, l. murinus, and l. fermentum. transfer of pam beta 1 between two l. reuteri strains occurred, and lactobacillus transconjugants could act as donors of pam beta 1 in crosses with enterococcus faecalis jh2-2.
