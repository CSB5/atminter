TI  == antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential of biosurfactants isolated from lactobacilli against multi-drug-resistant pathogens.
AB  == background: biosurfactants (bs) are amphiphilic compounds produced by microbes, either on the cell surface or secreted extracellularly. bs exhibit strong antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties, making them good candidates for applications used to combat infections. in this study, our goal was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities of bs produced by lactobacillus jensenii and lactobacillus rhamnosus against clinical multidrug  resistant (mdr) strains of acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). cell-bound bs from both l. jensenii and l. rhamnosus were extracted and isolated. the surface activities of crude bs samples were evaluated using an oil spreading assay. the antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities of both bs against the above mentioned mdr pathogens were determined. results: surface activities for both bs ranged from 6.25 to 25 mg/ml  with clear zones observed between 7 and 11 cm. bs of both l. jensenii and l. rhamnosus showed antimicrobial activities against a. baumannii, e. coli and s. aureus at 25-50 mg/ml. anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities were also observed for the aforementioned pathogens between 25 and 50 mg/ml. finally, analysis by electron microscope indicated that the bs caused membrane damage for  a. baumannii and pronounced cell wall damage in s. aureus. conclusion: our results indicate that bs isolated from two lactobacilli strains has antibacterial properties against mdr strains of a. baumannii, e. coli and mrsa. both bs also displayed anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities against a. baumannii, e. coli  and s. aureus. together, these capabilities may open up possibilities for bs as an alternative therapeutic approach for the prevention and/or treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == lactobacillus crispatus dominant vaginal microbiome is associated with inhibitory activity of female genital tract secretions against escherichia coli.
AB  == objective: female genital tract secretions inhibit e. coli ex vivo and the activity may prevent colonization and provide a biomarker of a healthy microbiome. we hypothesized that high e. coli inhibitory activity would be associated with a lactobacillus crispatus and/or jensenii dominant microbiome and differ from that of women with low inhibitory activity. study design: vaginal swab cell pellets from 20 samples previously obtained in a cross-sectional study  of near-term pregnant and non-pregnant healthy women were selected based on having high (>90% inhibition) or low (<20% inhibition) anti-e. coli activity. the v6 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene was amplified and sequenced using the illumina hiseq 2000 platform. filtered culture supernatants from lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, and gardnerella vaginalis were also assayed for e. coli inhibitory activity. results: sixteen samples (10 with high and 6 with low activity) yielded evaluable microbiome data. there was no difference in the predominant microbiome species in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women (n = 8  each). however, there were significant differences between women with high compared to low e. coli inhibitory activity. high activity was associated with a  predominance of l. crispatus (p<0.007) and culture supernatants from l. crispatus exhibited greater e. coli inhibitory activity compared to supernatants obtained from l. iners or g. vaginalis. notably, the e. coli inhibitory activity varied among different strains of l. crispatus. conclusion: microbiome communities with  abundant l. crispatus likely contribute to the e. coli inhibitory activity of vaginal secretions and efforts to promote this environment may prevent e. coli colonization and related sequelae including preterm birth.

TI  == lactobacillus proteins are associated with the bactericidal activity against e. coli of female genital tract secretions.
AB  == background: female genital tract secretions are bactericidal for escherichia (e.) coli ex vivo. however, the intersubject variability and molecules that contribute to this activity have not been defined. methods: the bactericidal activity and concentration of immune mediators in cervicovaginal lavage (cvl) collected from 99 healthy women were determined. results: cvl reduced the number of e. coli colonies by 68% [-26, 100] (median [range]). cvl were active against laboratory and clinical isolates of e. coli, but were inactive against lactobacillus species. bactericidal activity correlated with the concentration of protein recovered (p<0.001), but not with cytokines, chemokines or antimicrobial peptides. four cvl with>90% inhibitory activity (active) and two with<30% activity were subjected to ms/ms proteomic analysis. 215 proteins were identified and six were found exclusively in active samples. four of these corresponded to lactobacillus crispatus or jensenii proteins. moreover, culture supernatants from lactobacillus jensenii were bactericidal for e. coli. conclusion: both host and commensal microbiota proteins contribute to mucosal defense. identification of these proteins will facilitate the development of strategies to maintain a healthy vaginal microbiome and prevent colonization with pathogenic bacteria such as e. coli that increase the risk for urinary tract infections, preterm labor and perinatal infection.

TI  == altered biomarkers of mucosal immunity and reduced vaginal lactobacillus concentrations in sexually active female adolescents.
AB  == background: genital secretions collected from adult women exhibit in vitro activity against herpes simplex virus (hsv) and escherichia coli (e. coli), but prior studies have not investigated this endogenous antimicrobial activity or its mediators in adolescent females. methodology/principal findings: anti-hsv and anti-e.coli activity were quantified from cervicovaginal lavage (cvl) specimens collected from 20 sexually active adolescent females (15-18 years). soluble immune mediators that may influence this activity were measured in cvl, and concentrations of lactobacillus jensenii and crispatus were quantified by pcr from vaginal swabs. results for adolescents were compared to those obtained from  54 healthy, premenopausal adult women. relative to specimens collected from adults, cvl collected from adolescent subjects had significantly reduced activity against e. coli and diminished concentrations of protein, igg, and iga but significantly increased anti-hsv activity and concentrations of interleukin (il)-1alpha, il-6 and il-1 receptor antagonist. vaginal swabs collected from adolescent subjects had comparable concentrations of l. crispatus but significantly reduced concentrations of l. jensenii, relative to adult swabs. conclusions/significance: biomarkers of genital mucosal innate immunity may differ substantially between sexually active adolescents and adult women. these findings warrant further study and may have significant implications for prevention of sexually transmitted infections in adolescent females.

TI  == immunobiotic lactobacillus jensenii elicits anti-inflammatory activity in porcine intestinal epithelial cells by modulating negative regulators of the toll-like receptor signaling pathway.
AB  == the effect of lactobacillus jensenii tl2937 on the inflammatory immune response triggered by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) and lipopolysaccharide (lps) in a porcine intestinal epitheliocyte cell line (pie cells) was evaluated. challenges with etec or lps elicited toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-mediated inflammatory responses in cultured pie cells, indicating that our cell line may be useful for studying inflammation in the guts of weaning piglets. in addition,  we demonstrated that l. jensenii tl2937 attenuated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines caused by etec or lps challenge by downregulating tlr4-dependent nuclear factorkappab (nf-kappab) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) activation. furthermore, we demonstrated  that l. jensenii tl2937 stimulation of pie cells upregulated three negative regulators of tlrs: a20, bcl-3, and mkp-1, deepening the understanding of an immunobiotic mechanism of action. l. jensenii tl2937-mediated induction of negative regulators of tlrs would have a substantial physiological impact on homeostasis in pie cells, because excessive tlr inflammatory signaling would be downregulated. these results indicated that pie cells can be used to study the mechanisms involved in the protective activity of immunobiotics against intestinal inflammatory damage and may provide useful information for the development of new immunologically functional feeds that help to prevent inflammatory intestinal disorders, including weaning-associated intestinal inflammation.

TI  == acid-bile, antibiotic resistance and inhibitory properties of propionibacteria isolated from turkish traditional home-made cheeses.
AB  == in this study, a total of 29 propionibacterium spp. were isolated from traditional home-made turkish cheese samples. as a result of the identification,  isolates were identified as propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii (15 strains), propionibacterium jensenii (12), and propionibacterium thoenii (2). all isolates and 5 reference strains were examined for their abilities to survive at ph 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 and in the presence of 0.06, 0.15 and 0.30% bile salts, their influence on the growth of food-borne and  spoilage bacteria, as well as their sensitivity against 11 selected antibiotics.  only seven propionibacteria strains survived in both the acidic and bile salt environments. propionibacterium spp. strains strongly inhibited growth of the escherichia coli atcc 11229 and shigella sonnei mu:57 strains (91%). all propionibacteria strains were sensitive to a majority of the antibiotics used in  the investigations. overall, dairy propionibacteria showed high antibacterial activity, resistance to ph 4.0, 5.0, high resistance to bile salts and will provide an alternative source to lactobacillus and bifidobacterium as probiotic culture.

TI  == the effect of probiotics and organic acids on shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7.
AB  == probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for stec. shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and  hemolytic uremic syndrome. stec possesses shiga toxin 1 (stx1) and shiga toxin 2  (stx2), both of which have a and b subunits. although stec containing both stx1 and stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. thus, the effect of lactobacillus, pediococcus, and bifidobacterium strains on stx2a expression levels in stec was investigated. lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included l. rhamnosus gg, l. curvatus, l. plantarum, l. jensenii, l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. reuteri, p. acidilactici, p. cerevisiae, p. pentosaceus, b. thermophilum, b. boum, b. suis and b. animalis. e. coli o157:h7 (edl 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. following rna extraction and cdna synthesis, relative stx2a mrna levels were determined according to a comparative  critical threshold (ct) real-time pcr. data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and the level of stx2a expression between treated and untreated stec was compared. observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2a was down-regulated, when compared to the control  culture. probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in  ph, influenced stx2a gene expression.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide production and resistance to nonoxinol-9 in lactobacillus spp.  isolated from the vagina of reproductive-age women.
AB  == lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. however, some species of lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide-producers. women, who usually use intrauterine dispositive (iud) and spermicides such as nonoxinol-9 (n-9) as contraceptive methods, increase the risk of acquiring an urinary tract infection  and a bacterial vaginosis; some studies have demonstrated that these compounds alter the normal vaginal biota. it is known that they inhibit lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1% and that they do not have an effect on the  growth of escherichia coli. it is probable that the presence of nonoxinol-9 affects the ecological balance of the vagina by inhibiting the protector lactobacilli. in this study, we identified lactobacillus acidophilus, l. brevis,  l. crispatus, l. fermentii and l. jensenii as the species most frequently isolated from women. seventy-one hydrogen peroxide-producer strains and 48 strains resistant to the inhibitory effect of nonoxinol-9 were detected. l. brevis showed the highest number of resistant strains.

TI  == selection and identification of anaerobic lactobacilli producing inhibitory compounds against vaginal pathogens.
AB  == two strains of lactobacillus crispatus (15l08 and 21l07) and one strain of lactobacillus jensenii (5l08) were selected from amongst 100 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant to mucosal colonization and the production of h2o2 and/or bacteriocin-like compound. all three strains self-aggregated and adhered to vaginal epithelial cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as gardnerella vaginalis and candida albicans. lactobacillus crispatus 15l08 was characterized as a potential h2o2 producer. a high level of bacteriocin-like compound was synthesized by l. jensenii 5l08, with a bactericidal mode of action for g. vaginalis, c. albicans and escherichia coli. however, h2o2-dependent activity alone was not sufficient to inhibit the growth of c. albicans. simultaneous actions of h2o2 and bacteriocin-like compound produced by lactobacilli may be important for antagonizing pathogenic bacteria. these strains of lactobacilli may be excellent candidates for eventual use as probiotics to restore the normal microbial communities in the vaginal ecosystem.

TI  == prebiotic effects of oligosaccharides on selected vaginal lactobacilli and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select endogenous human vaginal lactobacilli strains on the basis of the main probiotic properties observed in the vaginal environment in order to use them for the evaluation of the potential prebiotic properties of oligosaccharides. from vaginal samples of 50 women with a normal flora, 17 lactobacilli strains were first isolated because of their high level of hydrogen peroxide production. then six strains were selected mainly for their ability (i) to adhere to vaginal cells, (ii) to produce compounds in sufficient amount, such as lactic acid, having an inhibitory action on pathogens, and less importantly, (iii) to demonstrate arginine deiminase activity. these six strains  were found to belong to three distinct species: lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii and l. vaginalis. one strain of each species was chosen as a potential vaginal probiotic strain with regard to our criteria. these three strains were then used to evaluate the prebiotic properties of different oligosaccharide series: two fructooligosaccharide series (fos actilight and fos raftilose) and two glucooligosaccharide series varying by their osidic linkages (alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos and alpha-1,2/alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos). the test was based on the ability of the oligosaccharides to promote the growth of the three beneficial strains selected but not of pathogenic microorganisms often encountered in urogenital infections such as candida albicans, escherichia coli and gardnerella vaginalis. oligosaccharide hydrolysis was followed by hplc analysis. this revealed that two oligosaccharide series (fos actilight dp3 and all alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos dp > or = 4) were used only by the lactobacilli strains, the pathogenic microorganisms being unable to metabolise them. the selected lactobacilli and oligosaccharides are good candidates for incorporation  in a formula to prevent vaginal infections.

TI  == vaginal lactobacillus isolates inhibit uropathogenic escherichia coli.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activities of lactobacillus jensenii ks119.1 and ks121.1, and lactobacillus gasserii ks120.1 and ks124.3 strains isolated from the vaginal microflora of healthy women, against uropathogenic, diffusely adhering afa/dr escherichia coli (afa/dr daec) strains ih11128 and 7372 involved in recurrent cystitis. we observed that some of the lactobacillus isolates inhibited the growth and decreased the viability of e. coli ih11128 and 7372. in addition, we observed that adhering lactobacillus strains inhibited adhesion of e. coli ih11128 onto hela cells, and inhibited internalization of e. coli ih11128 within hela cells.

TI  == inhibition of hiv infectivity by a natural human isolate of lactobacillus jensenii engineered to express functional two-domain cd4.
AB  == the predominant mode of hiv transmission worldwide is via heterosexual contact, with the cervico-vaginal mucosa being the main portal of entry in women. the cervico-vaginal mucosa is naturally colonized with commensal bacteria, primarily  lactobacilli. to address the urgent need for female-controlled approaches to block the heterosexual transmission of hiv, we have engineered natural human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus jensenii to secrete two-domain cd4 (2d cd4) proteins. the secreted 2d cd4 recognized a conformation-dependent anti-cd4 antibody and bound hiv type 1 (hiv-1) gp120, suggesting that the expressed proteins adopted a native conformation. single-cycle infection assays using hiv-1hxb2 carrying a luciferase reporter gene demonstrated that lactobacillus-derived 2d cd4 inhibited hiv-1 entry into target cells in a dose-dependent manner. importantly, coincubation of the engineered bacteria with  recombinant hiv-1hxb2 reporter virus led to a significant decrease in virus infectivity of hela cells expressing cd4-cxcr4-ccr5. engineered lactobacilli also caused a modest, but statistically significant, decrease in infectivity of a primary isolate, hiv-1jr-fl. this represents an important first step toward the development of engineered commensal bacteria within the vaginal microflora to inhibit heterosexual transmission of hiv.

TI  == antimicrobial components of vaginal fluid.
AB  == objective: we examined the antimicrobial activity and composition of vaginal fluid. study design: vaginal fluid from preweighed tampons was assayed for ph, lactic acid, and antimicrobial polypeptides. the fluid was also fractionated by molecular filtration. antimicrobial activity of whole fluid was determined against representative resident and exogenous microbes, and its fractions were tested against escherichia coli. results: vaginal fluids (5/5 donors) were permissive for lactobacillus crispatus and vaginalis and candida albicans, but not for escherichia coli, streptococcus group b, and lactobacillus jensenii in three of five donors. the antimicrobial activity against e coli was predominantly in a <3-kd fraction and correlated with both low ph and high lactic acid content. compared with a matched ph buffer, lactic acid markedly suppressed the growth of  e coli. concentrated 2- or 5-fold, the protein-rich fraction was active against e coli. conclusion: vaginal fluid exerts selective antimicrobial activity against nonresident bacterial species. the activity is mediated by lactic acid, low ph, and antimicrobial polypeptides.

TI  == lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  == samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. yeasts (20.1%), streptococcus spp. (8.7%), staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. the lactobacillus isolates were l. brevis (24.6%) l. fermentum (18.5%) l. casei (16.9%), l. delbrueckii (15.4%), l. plantarum (9.23%), l. acidophilus (7.69%), l. jensenii (4.62%), l. salivarius (1.54%) and l. gasseri (1.54%). the most common species was l. brevis (24.6%). the strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. all the lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella dysenteriae, s. sonnei, klebsiella spp. and campylobacter sp. all the lactobacilli except l. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. the involvement of lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. the ability of lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei in a murine model of escherichia coli urinary tract infection.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of the intraurethrally administered probiotic lactobacillus casei strain shirota against escherichia coli in a murine urinary tract infection (uti) model was examined. uti was induced by intraurethral administration of escherichia coli strain hu-1 (a clinical isolate from a uti patient, positive for type 1 and p fimbriae), at a dose of 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) cfu in 20 microl of saline, into a c3h/hen mouse bladder which had been traumatized with 0.1 n hcl followed immediately by neutralization with 0.1 n naoh 24 h before the challenge infection. chronic infection with the pathogen at 10(6) cfu in the urinary tract (bladder and kidneys) was maintained for more than 3 weeks after the challenge, and the number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and myeloperoxidase activity in the urine were markedly elevated during the infection period. a single administration of l. casei shirota at a dose of 10(8) cfu 24 h before the challenge infection dramatically inhibited e. coli growth and inflammatory responses in the urinary tract. multiple daily treatments with l. casei shirota during the postinfection period also showed antimicrobial activity  in this uti model. a heat-killed preparation of l. casei shirota exerted significant antimicrobial effects not only with a single pretreatment (100 microg/mouse) but also with multiple daily treatments during the postinfection period. the other lactobacillus strains tested, i.e., l. fermentum atcc 14931(t), l. jensenii atcc 25258(t), l. plantarum atcc 14917(t), and l. reuteri jcm 1112(t), had no significant antimicrobial activity. taken together, these results suggest that the probiotic l. casei strain shirota is a potent therapeutic agent  for uti.

TI  == adherence of human vaginal lactobacilli to vaginal epithelial cells and interaction with uropathogens.
AB  == three strains of lactobacillus, identified as lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus jensenii, were selected from among 70 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant  to mucosal colonization or antagonism. all three self-aggregated and adhered to epithelial vaginal cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as g. vaginalis, and inhibiting the growth in vitro of escherichia coli and streptococcus agalactiae. the surface components involved in self-aggregation appeared to be proteins for l. gasseri and lipoproteins for l. acidophilus and l. jensenii, as judged by susceptibility to treatment with appropriate degrading enzymes. the factors responsible for adherence to epithelial vaginal cells seemed to be glycoproteins (l. acidophilus and l. gasseri) and carbohydrate (l. jensenii). the receptors of the vaginal cells were glycolipids, which presumably  were the targets of the competition observed between the lactobacilli and the pathogenic microbes.
