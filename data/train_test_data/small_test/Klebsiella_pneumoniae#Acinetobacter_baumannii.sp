TI  == multi-drug resistant acinetobacter baumannii infections in lung transplant patients in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit.
AB  == background: multi-drug resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacteria are a growing threat to solid organ transplantation (sot) patients in the intensive care unit (icu). we aimed to examine the mortality rates of gram negative mdr bacterial infection in sot patients compared with patient population undergoing other cardio-thoracic surgeries and hospitalized under similar icu conditions. methods: a retrospective study from a single medical center, including patients with mdr acinetobacter baumannii and carbapenem resistant klebsiella pneumoniae infection, hospitalized in the cardiothoracic icu. data were collected from computerized databases and data were verified using the hospitalization files. microbiological data were provided by the microbiology lab. results: during the study period, 205 sot patients and 5031 other patients were hospitalized in the cardio-thoracic icu. active infection with gram negative mdr bacteria was identified in 147 patients, of which 37 underwent sot (18% of total transplant recipients) and 110  underwent another cardiothoracic surgery (2% of total patients who are not transplant recipients). mortality rates were high among both groups of patients,  with no significant difference between them.. conclusions: infection with resistant bacteria is more prevalent among patients following sot compared with patients following other cardiothoracic surgeries. mortality is high in all patients regardless of the immunocompromised condition. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == device-associated infection rates and bacterial resistance in six academic teaching hospitals of iran: findings from the international nocosomial infection  control consortium (inicc).
AB  == device-associated health care-acquired infections (da-hais) pose a threat to patient safety, particularly in the intensive care unit (icu). however, few data  regarding da-hai rates and their associated bacterial resistance in icus from iran are available. a da-hai surveillance study was conducted in six adult and pediatric icus in academic teaching hospitals in tehran using cdc/nhsn definitions. we collected prospective data regarding device use, da-hai rates, and lengths of stay from 2584 patients, 16,796 bed-days from one adult icu, and bacterial profiles and bacterial resistance from six icus. among the da-hais, there were 5.84 central line-associated bloodstream infections (clabs) per 1000 central line-days, 7.88 ventilator-associated pneumonias (vaps) per 1000 mechanical ventilator-days and 8.99 catheter-associated urinary tract infections  (cautis) per 1000 urinary catheter-days. the device utilization ratios were 0.44  for central lines, 0.42 for mechanical ventilators and 1.0 for urinary catheters. the device utilization ratios of mechanical ventilators and urinary catheters were higher than those reported in the icus of the inicc and the cdc's nhsn reports, but central line use was lower. the da-hai rates in this study were higher than the cdc's nhsn report. however, compared with the inicc report, the vap rate in our study was lower, while the clab rate was similar and the cauti rate was higher. nearly 83% of the samples showed a mixed-type infection. the most frequent pathogens were acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and enterococcus spp. in the s. aureus isolates, 100% were resistant to oxacillin. overall resistances  of a. baumannii and k. pneumonia to imipenem were 70.5% and 76.7%, respectively.  a multiple drug resistance phenotype was detected in 68.15% of the isolates. the  da-hai rates in iran were shown to be higher than the cdc-nhsn rates and similar  to the inicc rates. resistance to oxacillin and imipenem was higher as well. comparing device use, da-hai rates, and bacterial resistance for the primary isolated bacteria indicated a direct association between urinary catheter use and the rates of cauti.

TI  == comparative evaluation of colistin susceptibility testing methods among carbapenem-non-susceptible klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates.
AB  == we compared six colistin susceptibility testing (st) methods in 61 carbapenem-non-susceptible klebsiella pneumoniae (n=41) and acinetobacter baumannii (n=20) with provisionally elevated colistin mics by the routine st. colistin mics were determined by broth microdilution (bmd) as reference method, bmd with 0.002% polysorbate 80 (p80) (bmd-p80), agar dilution (ad), etest, vitek2 and mic test strip (mts). the eucast recommended susceptible/resistant breakpoint of </=2/>2 mug/ml was applied for both k. pneumoniae and a. baumannii. the proportion of colistin-resistant strains was 95.1/77.0/96.7/57.4/65.6/98.4% by bmd/bmd-p80/ad/etest/mts/vitek2, respectively. etest and mts produced excessive rates of very major errors (vmes; 39.3 and 31.1%, respectively), while bmd-p80 18.0% vmes, ad 3.3% vmes and vitek2 no vme. major errors (mes) were rather limited by all tested methods. these data show that gradient diffusion methods may lead to inappropriate colistin therapy. clinical laboratories should consider using automated systems, such as vitek2 or dilution methods for colistin st.

TI  == development of two real-time multiplex pcr assays for the detection and quantification of eight key bacterial pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the frequent lack of a positive and timely microbiological diagnosis in patients  with lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) is an important obstacle to antimicrobial stewardship. patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but, because these  are often slow, negative, or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice. the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two multiplex real-time pcr assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. we found that all eight bacterial targets could be reliably quantified from sputum specimens down to a concentration of 100 cfus/reaction (8333 cfus/ml). furthermore, all 249 positive control isolates were correctly detected with our assay, demonstrating effectiveness on both reference strains and local clinical isolates. the specificity was 98% on a panel of nearly 100 negative control isolates. bacterial load was quantified accurately when three bacterial targets were present in mixtures of varying concentrations, mimicking likely clinical scenarios in lrti.  concordance with culture was 100% for culture-positive sputum specimens, and 90%  for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, and additional culture-negative bacterial infections were detected and quantified. in conclusion, a quantitative  molecular test for eight key bacterial causes of lrti has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time-point of patient admission than current standard methods. this should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use.

TI  == bactericidal efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) against  the eskape pathogens.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens within the clinical environment is presenting a mounting problem in hospitals worldwide. the 'eskape' pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) have been  highlighted as a group of causative organisms in a majority of nosocomial infections, presenting a serious health risk due to widespread antimicrobial resistance. the stagnating pipeline of new antibiotics requires alternative approaches to the control and treatment of nosocomial infections. atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (apntp) is attracting growing interest as an alternative infection control approach within the clinical setting. this study presents a comprehensive bactericidal assessment of an in-house-designed apntp jet both against biofilms and planktonic bacteria of the eskape pathogens. standard plate counts and the xtt metabolic assay were used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of apntp, with both methods demonstrating comparable eradication times. apntp exhibited rapid antimicrobial activity against all of the eskape pathogens in the planktonic mode of growth and provided efficient and  complete eradication of eskape pathogens in the biofilm mode of growth within 360s, with the exception of a. baumannii where a >4log reduction in biofilm viability was observed. this demonstrates its effectiveness as a bactericidal treatment against these pathogens and further highlights its potential application in the clinical environment for the control of highly antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == repurposing non-antimicrobial drugs and clinical molecules to treat bacterial infections.
AB  == there is a pressing need to develop novel antimicrobials to circumvent the scourge of antimicrobial resistance. the objective of this study is to identify non-antibiotic drugs with potent antimicrobial activity, within an applicable clinical range. a library, containing 727 fda approved drugs and small molecules, was screened against eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobactercloacae). drugs that showed antimicrobial activity in an applicable clinical range were further tested in vitro and in vivo in an infected mouse model. the initial screening identified 24 non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules active against gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) isolates. two non-antibiotic drugs showed activity against gram-negative pathogens. among the active non-antibiotic drugs, only ebselen (eb) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (fdurd), showed bactericidal activity, in an applicable  clinical range, against multi-drug-resistant staphylococcus isolates including mrsa, vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa), and vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa).the minimum inhibitory concentration at which 90% of clinical isolates of s. aureus were inhibited (mic90) was found to be 0.25 and 0.0039mg/l  for eb and fdurd, respectively. treatment with eb orally significantly increased  mice survival in a lethal model of septicemic mrsa-infection by (60%) compared to that of control. fdurd oral and intraperitoneal treatment significantly enhanced  mouse survival by 60% and 100%, respectively. these data encourage screening and  repurposing of non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.

TI  == inhibition of aminoglycoside acetyltransferase resistance enzymes by metal salts.
AB  == aminoglycosides (ags) are clinically relevant antibiotics used to treat infections caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, as well as mycobacteria. as with all current antibacterial agents, resistance to ags is an increasing problem. the most common mechanism of resistance to ags is the presence of ag-modifying enzymes (ames) in bacterial cells, with ag acetyltransferases (aacs) being the most prevalent. recently, it was discovered that zn(2+) metal ions displayed an inhibitory effect on the resistance enzyme aac(6')-ib in acinetobacter baumannii and escherichia coli. in this study, we explore a wide array of metal salts (mg(2+), cr(3+), cr(6+), mn(2+), co(2+), ni(2+), cu(2+), zn(2+), cd(2+), and au(3+) with different counter ions) and their inhibitory effect on a large repertoire of aacs [aac(2')-ic, aac(3)-ia, aac(3)-ib, aac(3)-iv, aac(6')-ib', aac(6')-ie, aac(6')-iid, and eis]. in addition, we determine the mic values for amikacin and tobramycin in combination  with a zinc pyrithione complex in clinical isolates of various bacterial strains  (two strains of a. baumannii, three of enterobacter cloacae, and four of klebsiella pneumoniae) and one representative of each species purchased from the  american type culture collection.

TI  == susceptibility trends and molecular characterization of gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections in jordan and lebanon: smart 2011-2013.
AB  == objectives: to investigate phenotypic and genotypic patterns of antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract infection (uti) and intra-abdominal infection (iai) in medical centres of jordan and lebanon. methods: gram-negative bacilli from the smart study, collected between the years 2011 and 2013, were first identified at local laboratories. these isolates were shipped to a central laboratory where re-identification, susceptibility testing, and molecular characterization were performed using standard methods. results: among the 523 uti-associated isolates, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis were the most frequent (70%, 14%, and 5%, respectively). e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequent species among the 527 iai-associated isolates (46%, 14%, and 12%, respectively). incidence rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers among uti-associated e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis were 43%, 54%, and 4%, respectively. corresponding rates among iai-associated isolates were 49%, 56%, and 12%, respectively. acinetobacter baumannii and p. aeruginosa isolates showed very disturbing low susceptibility patterns. ctx-m-15  was the most prevalent esbl produced. seventeen isolates were non-susceptible to  carbapenems (estimated prevalence of 1.6%). conclusions: the alarmingly high rates of esbl production and emergence of carbapenemases emphasize the urgent need to develop antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and to maintain antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems.

TI  == the risk factors for mortality and septic shock in liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia.
AB  == background/aims: although bacteremias due to the six eskape pathogens have recently been identified as a serious emerging problems in solid organ transplant (sot), no information in liver transplant recipients is available. we sought to investigate the risk factors for mortality and septic shock in liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia. methodology: a retrospective analysis of bacteremia after liver transplantation was reviewed. risk factors for mortality and septic shock caused by eskape bacteremia were identified. results: forty-nine episodes ofbacteremia in 37 liver transplant recipients were due to eskape strains. the only factor for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with eskape was septic shock (odds ratio [or] = 67.500, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 8.464-538.300, p < .001). the factors for septic shock independently associated with eskape were white blood cells count > 15,000/mm3 (or = 15.205, 95% ci = 2.271-101.799, p = .005) and temperature of 39 degrees c or greater (or = 10.959, 95% ci = 1.592-75.450, p = .015). conclusions: to improve the results of liver transplantation, more effectively therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when liver transplant recipients with eskape bacteremia present with septic shock, elevated white blood cells count and high body temperature.

TI  == repurposing salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs to combat drug resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the us. repurposing food and drug administration (fda) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. in this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. the fda approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic):  0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). the two drugs were also effective against another gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecium (mic 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter aerogenes. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant s. aureus clinical isolates, with mics at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. a time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. oxyclozanide was non-toxic to hepg2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro mics but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. these data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.

TI  == microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a university hospital.
AB  == background: microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in state university of campinas, no data has been published yet. methods: the main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. the blood culture records requested from  4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. the samples were processed using the bact/alert system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. results: a total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). there were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). the prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns) (15.87%), escherichia coli (13.0%), staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), enterobacter sp (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and candida sp (5.1%). examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of  the s. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and 80% of the cns isolates were oxacillin-resistant. for a. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs  were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for p. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. when all gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to  beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. conclusions: eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. for empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.

TI  == inhibitory-based method for detection of klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase acinetobacter baumannii isolated from burn patients.
AB  == background: klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc) is one of the carbapenemases that can cause multi-antibiotics resistance in acinetobacter baumannii. a simple phenotypic rapid and accurate test for the detection of a. baumannii - kpc-producer can be useful in treating related infections. the aim of this study was to determine the synergism effect of boronic acid (ba), as an inhibitor, and meropenem to confirm modified hodge test (mht) positive strains for kpc-production. materials and methods: totally, 126 a. baumannii isolates were used as clinical strains. imipenem resistant isolates were identified by disk diffusion method according to the clinical laboratory standards institute recommendations. presence of kpc in imipenem resistant isolates was determined using the mht. in addition, we used ba as a kpc inhibitor for final confirmation  of the species of interest. additionally, we employed the use of synergism effect of meropenem and cloxacillin to detect false positive cases. results: of 126 strains, 108 were resistant to imipenem, for which 93 strains were mht positive.  totally, 68 out of 93 mht positive isolates had at least 5 mm enlargement of the  diameter of the zone of growth inhibition between the meropenem alone and meropenem combined with ba. of these 68 isolates, 8 had at least 5 mm enlargement of the diameter of the zone of growth inhibition with ba alone and in 60 strains  it was observed by cloxacillin. conclusion: our study suggests that mht alone cannot confirm kpc-producer microorganisms and that it requires other complementary tests such as the usage of inhibitors.

TI  == trends in paediatric bloodstream infections at a south african referral hospital.
AB  == background: the epidemiology of paediatric bloodstream infection (bsi) in sub-saharan africa is poorly documented with limited data on hospital-acquired sepsis, impact of hiv infection, bsi trends and antimicrobial resistance. methods: we retrospectively reviewed paediatric bsi (0-14 years) at tygerberg children's hospital between 1 january 2008 and 31 december 2013 (excluding neonatal wards). laboratory and hospital data were used to determine bsi rates, blood culture contamination, pathogen profile, patient demographics, antimicrobial resistance and factors associated with mortality. fluconazole resistant candida species, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), multi-drug resistant acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing enterobacteriaceae were classified as antimicrobial resistant pathogens. results: of 17001 blood cultures over 6 years, 935 cultures isolated 979 pathogens (5.5% yield; 95% ci 5.3-5.7%). contamination rates were high (6.6%, 95% ci 6.4-6.8%), increasing over time (p = 0.003). discrete bsi episodes were identified (n = 864) with median patient age of 7.5 months, male predominance (57%) and 13% hiv prevalence. bsi rates declined significantly over time (4.6-3.1, overall rate 3.5 per 1000 patient days; 95% ci 3.3-3.7; chi square for  trend p = 0.02). gram negative pathogens predominated (60% vs 33% gram positives  and 7% fungal); klebsiella pneumoniae (154; 17%), staphylococcus aureus (131; 14%) and escherichia coli (97; 11%) were most prevalent. crude bsi mortality was  20% (176/864); hiv infection, fungal, gram negative and hospital-acquired sepsis  were significantly associated with mortality on multivariate analysis. hospital-acquired bsi was common (404/864; 47%). overall antimicrobial resistance rates were high (70% in hospital vs 25% in community-acquired infections; p < 0.0001); hospital-acquired infection, infancy, hiv-infection and gram negative sepsis were associated with resistance. s. pneumoniae bsi declined significantly  over time (58/465 [12.5%] to 33/399 [8.3%]; p =0.04). conclusion: although bsi rates declined over time, children with bsi had high mortality and pathogens exhibited substantial antimicrobial resistance in both community and hospital-acquired infections. blood culture sampling technique and local options  for empiric antimicrobial therapy require re-evaluation.

TI  == influence of antimicrobial consumption on gram-negative bacteria in inpatients receiving antimicrobial resistance therapy from 2008-2013 at a tertiary hospital  in shanghai, china.
AB  == background: irrational use of antimicrobial agents is a major cause of increased  antimicrobial resistance. effective antibiotic stewardship strategies nationwide  or in local health care settings are necessary to reduce antibiotic use and bacteria resistance. methods: we evaluated the effectiveness of china's antimicrobial stewardship policy on antimicrobial use and applied time-series analysis methodology to determine the temporal relationship between antibiotic use and gram-negative bacteria resistance at changhai hospital from 2008-2013. isolates investigated included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. results: consumption of 7 restricted-use antibiotics was dramatically reduced. resistance to ceftazidime in p aeruginosa and a baumannii and resistance to ciprofloxacin in p aeruginosa significantly decreased. by using cross-correlation analysis, associations between ciprofloxacin resistance in p aeruginosa and fluoroquinolones consumption (r = 0.48; lag = 0; p = .02), ceftazidime resistance in p aeruginosa and third-generation cephalosporins consumption (r = 0.54; lag = -1; p = .01) were identified. no substantial association between other pairs was found. conclusions: enhanced nationwide antimicrobial stewardship campaigns launched in  2011 have made great achievements in regard to antibiotic use but have had limited effects on the reversal of gram-negative bacteria resistance in health care settings. sound infection prevention and control programs to reduce the transmission of resistant pathogens for hospitals in china are urgently needed.

TI  == the challenge of antimicrobial resistance in managing intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == background: in recent years, there has been a worldwide increase in infections caused by microorganisms resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. methods: in  the past few decades, an increased prevalence of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including enterococcus spp., carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella spp., carbapenemase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, and resistant candida spp., also has been observed among intra-abdominal infections (iais). results: the increasing prevalence of multi-drug resistance is responsible for a substantial increase in morbidity and mortality rates associated with iais. conclusions: it is necessary for every surgeon treating iais to understand the underlying epidemiology and clinical consequences of antimicrobial resistance. emergence of  drug resistance, combined with the lack of new agents in the drug development pipeline, indicates that judicious antimicrobial management will be necessary to  preserve the utility of the drugs available currently.

TI  == characterization of carbapenemases in extensively drug resistance acinetobacter baumannii in a burn care center in iran.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug resistance (mdr) and extensively drug resistance (xdr) in acinetobacter baumannii has made an important challenge in the treatment of infections caused by this organism. the ability of carbapenemase production is one of the main mechanisms for the emergence of mdr and/or xdr in a. baumannii. the aim of this study was to detect carbapenemase producer a. baumannii. in this  study, 65 imipenem resistant a. baumannii were collected from burned patients. biochemical identification, antibiotic susceptibility test and multiplex polymerase chain reactions for the detection of carbapenemases genes were performed. the results showed that all strains carried bla oxa-51. 83%, 12.5% and 9.23% strains harbored bla oxa-23, bla vim and bla kpc genes, respectively. none  of the isolates carried bla imp, bla oxa-48, blandm-1 and bla spm-1 genes. the results of this study indicate the emergence of klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc) in a. baumannii causing nosocomial infections in burned patients which can be important for hospital infection prevention systems in iran.

TI  == the carbapenem inactivation method (cim), a simple and low-cost alternative for the carba np test to assess phenotypic carbapenemase activity in gram-negative rods.
AB  == a new phenotypic test, called the carbapenem inactivation method (cim), was developed to detect carbapenemase activity in gram-negative rods within eight hours. this method showed high concordance with results obtained by pcr to detect genes coding for the carbapenemases kpc, ndm, oxa-48, vim, imp and oxa-23. it allows reliable detection of carbapenemase activity encoded by various genes in species of enterobacteriaceae (e.g., klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and  enterobacter cloacae), but also in non-fermenters pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. the cim was shown to be a cost-effective and highly robust phenotypic screening method that can reliably detect carbapenemase activity.

AB  == background and aim: tigecycline is a semi-synthetic tetracycline with activity against most multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria. methods: we studied in vitro activity of tigecycline by agar dilution (ad) and etest methods to evaluate their correlation. the study included 206 isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  (esbl)-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and mdr acinetobacter baumannii recovered from blood cultures of patients of baskent university between 2008 and 2010. results: esbl-producing e. coli had mic50/mic90 values of 0.5/0.5  microg/ml by ad and 0.25/0.5 microg/ml by etest. esbl-producing k. pneumoniae had mic50/mic90 values of 1/2 microg/ml by ad and 0.75/2 microg/ml by etest, whereas  mdr a. baumannii had mic50/mic90 values of 4/4 microg/ml by ad and 2/4 microg/ml  by etest. the correlation between ad and etest was weak for esbl-producing e. coli and strong for esbl-producing k. pneumoniae and mdr a. baumannii. tigecycline mic values for esbl-producing e. coli were lower than the tigecycline concentration, while they were higher than the concentrations attainable by treatment doses for a. baumannii. conclusion: tigecycline is an appropriate agent in the treatment of e. coli bacteremia, but it is not for treating a. baumannii bacteremia. tigecycline could be used for k. pneumoniae bacteremia treatment after determining its mic value. determining the mic value by gold-standard methods is more appropriate due to the correlation between etest and ad at high mic values.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == colistin, mechanisms and prevalence of resistance.
AB  == background: infections caused by multi-drug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, particularly acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, that cause nosocomial infections, represent a growing problem worldwide. the rapid increase in the prevalence of gram-negative pathogens that are resistant to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides as well as all beta-lactams, including carbapenems, monobactam, cephalosporins and broad-spectrum penicillins, has prompted the reconsideration of colistin as a valid therapeutic option. colistin is an old class of cationic, which act by disrupting the bacterial membranes resulting in cellular death. although there has been a significant recent increase in the data gathered on colistin, focusing on its chemistry, antibacterial activity, mechanism of action and resistance, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and new clinical application, the prevalence of colistin resistance has been very little reported in the literature. this review concentrates on recent literature aimed at optimizing the clinical use of  this important antibiotic. methods: the available evidence from various studies (microbiological and clinical studies, retrieved from the pubmed, and scopus databases) regarding the mechanisms and prevalence of resistance was evaluated. results: increasing use of colistin for treatment of infections caused by these bacteria has led to the emergence of colistin resistance in several countries worldwide. although resistance to polymyxins is generally less than 10%, it is higher in the mediterranean and south-east asia (korea and singapore), where colistin resistance rates are continually increasing. conclusion: there is a critical need for effective infection prevention and control measures and strict  use of antibiotics in the world to control the rise and spread of colistin resistance.

TI  == spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  == ac-gf(a6c)g(a6c)k(a6c)g(a6c)f(a6c)g(a6c)gk(a6c)kkkk-amide (a6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (amp) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43mum. spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this  amp interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. cd and 2d-(1)h nmr experiments indicated this amp  on binding to sds and dpc micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages  of helical and random coil conformers. cd investigations in the presence of three phospholipid suvs consisting of popc, 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc revealed: (1) the interactions occurring with popc suvs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the amp yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) the interactions with 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc suvs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the cd spectra. (3) the presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of suvs as was the case with micelles. this data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this amp are very different from the diversity of  conformations adopted by this amp on insertion into the lipid bilayer. cd spectra of this amp in the presence of suvs consisting of lps isolated from p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.

TI  == rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart).
AB  == background: data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (icus) in taiwan are lacking. methods: we surveyed the mic distribution patterns  of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of  major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan in 2007. we also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute in 2014 were applied. results: colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against acinetobacter baumannii isolates but  moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. cloacae. the ceftobiprole mic90 value was 4 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/ml for p. aeruginosa. the  phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the mic value of ceftobiprole among s. aureus isolates. interestingly, the proportion of isolates  that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among p. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. conclusion: continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of icu pathogens to  important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens  against infections in the icu.

TI  == comparative evaluation of multiplex pcr and routine laboratory phenotypic methods for detection of carbapenemases among gram negative bacilli.
AB  == background: carbapenem resistant pathogens cause infections associated with significant morbidity and mortality. objective: this study evaluates the use of multiplex pcr for rapid detection of carbapenemase genes among carbapenem resistant gram negative bacteria in comparison with the existing phenotypic methods like modified hodge test (mht), combined disc test (cdt) and automated methods. material and methods: a total of 100 carbapenem resistant clinical isolates, [escherichia coli (25), klebsiella pneumoniae (35) p. aeruginosa (18) and acinetobacter baumannii (22)] were screened for the presence of carbapenemases (bla ndm-1, bla vim , blaimp and blakpc genes) by phenotype methods such as the modified hodge test (mht) and combined disc test (cdt) and the molecular methods such as multiplex pcr. results: seventy of the 100 isolates were mht positive while, 65 isolates were positive by cdt. all the cdt positive isolates with edta and apb were metallo betalactamase (mbl) and k. pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc) producers respectively. bla ndm-1 was present as a lone gene  in 44 isolates. in 14 isolates bla ndm-1 gene was present with blakpc gene, and in one isolate bla ndm-1 gene was present with blavim , gene. only one e. coli isolate had a lone blakpc gene. we didn't find bla imp gene in any of the isolates. neither of the genes could be detected in 35 isolates. conclusion: accurate detection of the genes related with carbapenemase production by molecular methods like multiplex pcr overcome the limitations of the phenotypic methods and automated systems.

TI  == global assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility among gram-negative organisms collected from pediatric patients between 2004 and 2012: results from the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial.
AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) was designed to monitor  susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents among important pathogens. we report here on susceptibility among gram-negative pathogens collected globally from pediatric patients between 2004 and 2012. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using guidelines published by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). most enterobacteriaceae showed high rates of susceptibility (>95%) to amikacin, tigecycline, and the carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem); 90.8% of acinetobacter baumannii isolates were susceptible to minocycline, and susceptibility rates were highest in north america, europe, and asia/pacific rim. amikacin was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa (90.4% susceptibility), with susceptibility rates being highest in north america. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were reported for 11.0% of escherichia  coli isolates and 24.2% of klebsiella pneumoniae isolates globally, with rates reaching as high as 25.7% in the middle east and >43% in africa and latin america, respectively. statistically significant (p<0.01) differences in susceptibility rates were noted between pediatric age groups (1 to 5 years, 6 to  12 years, or 13 to 17 years of age), globally and in some regions, for all pathogens except haemophilus influenzae. significant (p<0.01) differences were reported for all pathogens globally and in most regions, considerably more frequently, when pediatric and adult susceptibility results were compared. amikacin, tigecycline, and the carbapenems were active in vitro against most gram-negative pathogens collected from pediatric patients; a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were susceptible to fewer antimicrobial agents. susceptibility rates among isolates from pediatric patients were frequently different from those among isolates collected from adults.

TI  == epidemiological monitoring of nosocomial infections caused by acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == introduction: acinetobacter baumannii is a frequent cause of infections in hospitals around the world, which is very difficult to control and treat. it is particularly prevalent in intensive care wards. aim: the main objective of the research was to establish the application of epidemiological monitoring of nosocomial infections (nis) caused by a. baumannii in order to determine: the type and distribution of nis, and to investigate antimicrobial drug resistance of a. baumannii. material and methods: 855 patients treated at the clinic of anesthesiology and reanimation, university clinical center tuzla during 2013 were followed prospectively for the development of nis. infections caused by a. baumannii were characterized by the anatomical site and antibiotics resistance profile. results: nis were registered in 105 patients (12.3%; 855/105). the predominant cause of infection was a. baumannii with an incidence of 51.4% (54/105), followed by esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae with 15.2% (16/105) of cases, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus with 8.6% (9/105), and esbl-producing proteus mirabilis with 7.6% (8/105). according to the anatomical site, and type of nis caused by a. baumannii, the most frequent were respiratory  infections (74.1%; 40/54). infections of surgical sites were registered in 11.1%  (6/54) of cases, while bloodstream infections in 9.2% (5/54). a. baumannii isolates tested resistant against most antibiotics examined, but showed a high degree of susceptibility to tobramycin (87%; 47/54) and colistin (100%; 54/54). conclusion: the increasing incidence of multi- and extensively drug-resistant acinetobacter spp. emphasizes the importance of administration of an adequate antibiotic strategy and the implementation of strict monitoring of the measures for controlling nosocomial infections.

TI  == bloodstream infections among carriers of carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae: etiology, incidence and predictors.
AB  == carriers of carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (crkp) are increasingly recognised through active surveillance in much of the world. we studied incidence, aetiology and predictors of bloodstream infections (bsi) among such carriers. via a retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary care teaching  hospital, we examined occurrence of bsi within 45 days of crkp carrier detection. three nested case-control studies were conducted to analyse parameters associated with all-cause (all), gram-negative rod (gnr) and crkp bsi. cases and controls were compared with respect to demographics, clinical parameters and recent receipt of antibiotics. a total of 431 patients were identified as crkp carriers  (28% by clinical culture, 72% by rectal surveillance), mean age was 75.2 years. twenty percent of the patients (n = 85) developed bsi, of them 80% (n = 68) with  gnr. of 83 gnr isolates, 58 (70%) were enterobacteriaceae, of which 19 were crkp  and 20 were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers (23% and 24% of total gnr, respectively); 29% of the gnr isolates were nonfermenters (14.5% pseudomonas aeruginosa, 14.5% acinetobacter baumannii). mechanical ventilation predicted all bsi (p = 0.04), whereas clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea  predicted gnr bsi (p = 0.04). receipt of broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam, amikacin, imipenem) was significantly associated with all bsi or gnr bsi. no exposure independently predicted crkp bsi. we conclude that patients detected as crkp carriers are at high risk for bsi within 45 days of detection, primarily with multidrug-resistant gnr. lack of predictive factors  differentiating between pathogens and associated high mortality raises once more  the dilemma regarding the appropriate empiric therapy for crkp carriers who develop severe sepsis.

TI  == drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  == puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). the most common species was escherichia coli (n=98), followed by enterococcus faecalis (n=54), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), proteus mirabilis (n=32), staphylococcus aureus (n=27), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and enterobacter cloacae (n=21). s.  aureus and acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while e. coli, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections.  resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blactx-m-1 group beta-lactamases. the ctx-m gene in e. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blactx-m-15, and phylogroup b2 isolates with blactx-m-15 were classified into st131 with o25b allele, harboring  aac(6')-ib-cr and various virulence factors. carbapenemase genes blandm-1 and blandm-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup a e. coli. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates had type iv or v sccmec, including isolates of st361 (cc672), which is related to an emerging st672 clone in the indian subcontinent. this study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.

TI  == faecal carriage of carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli in hospital settings in southern france.
AB  == the emergence of carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli is a worldwide problem. to date, no study has evaluated the prevalence of faecal carriage of carbapenemase-producing and carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli (cr gnb) in france. from 1 february to 30 april 2012, we conducted a prospective, multicentre study in three university hospitals and four general hospitals in the south of france. the carriage of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) and other cr gnb was screened by both cultivation on chromid(r) carba and chromid(r) oxa-48 media (biomerieux) and molecular tools [multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and nuclisens easyq(r) kpc (biomerieux)]. the genetic relationship between isolates was assessed by rep-pcr (diversilab, biomerieux) or multilocus sequence typing (mlst). the prevalences of cr gnb and carbapenemase-producing bacteria were 2.4 % (27/1,135) and 0.4 % (n = 5), respectively. two strains corresponded to oxa-23-producing acinetobacter baumannii and belonged to the widespread sequence type (st) 2/international clone ii, whereas one strain was an st15 oxa-48-producing klebsiella pneumoniae. two oxa-48-producers were detected exclusively by pcr. this first french study revealed the very low dissemination of carbapenemase-producing bacteria in patients attending hospitals in southern france during a non-outbreak situation.  however, the increasing description of epidemic cases in this area must reinforce the use of hygiene procedures to prevent diffusion of these multidrug-resistant microorganisms.

TI  == gram-negative infections in adult intensive care units of latin america and the caribbean.
AB  == this review summarizes recent epidemiology of gram-negative infections in selected countries from latin american and caribbean adult intensive care units (icus). a systematic search of the biomedical literature (pubmed) was performed to identify articles published over the last decade. where appropriate, data also were collected from the reference list of published articles, health departments  of specific countries, and registries. independent cohort data from all countries (argentina, brazil, chile, colombia, cuba, mexico, trinidad and tobago, and venezuela) signified a high rate of icu infections (prevalence: argentina, 24%; brazil, 57%). gram-negative pathogens, predominantly acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli, accounted for >50% of icu infections, which were often complicated by the presence of multidrug-resistant strains and clonal outbreaks. empirical use of antimicrobial  agents was identified as a strong risk factor for resistance development and excessive mortality. infection control strategies utilizing hygiene measures and  antimicrobial stewardship programs reduced the rate of device-associated infections. to mitigate the poor health outcomes associated with infections by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, urgent focus must be placed on infection control strategies and local surveillance programs.

TI  == antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of alcoholic extracts obtained from vegetative organs of a. retroflexus.
AB  == in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of amaranthus retroflexus leaves and inflorescence alcoholic (ethanol 70%) extracts of various concentrations ranging from 0.78 to 400 mul/ml were analyzed on different clinical and reference bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtills, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii) and fungal strains (candida albicans, c. famata, c. utilis, saccharomyces cerevisiae) using agar disk diffusion method and broth dilution method (mic determination) for antimicrobial  activity and teac (trolox capacity) assay for the evaluation of the antioxidant activity. the adapted diffusion method was used to test the antimicrobial effect  of the extracts separately and in combination with a range of standard antibiotics, in order to evidence any synergic effects of a. retroflexus extracts on the antibiotics activity. the extracts showed the highest inhibitory effect against k. pneumoniae and b. subtilis with no activity against s. aureus among the bacterial strains, while in case of the fungal strains the most intensive effect was exhibited against c. famata by both extracts. the a. retroflexus leaves extract improved the ciprofloxacin and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid activity towards the p. aeruginosa clinical strain. the inflorescences extract significantly increased chloramphenicol activity on b. subtilis strain. the antioxidant activity assay showed that the studied extracts exhibited the ability to neutralize the free radicals leading to the conclusion that the tested extracts bear compounds with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and antioxidant activity that could represent a potential alternative for treating various infectious diseases.

TI  == mechanisms of polymyxin resistance: acquired and intrinsic resistance in bacteria.
AB  == polymyxins are polycationic antimicrobial peptides that are currently the last-resort antibiotics for the treatment of multidrug-resistant, gram-negative bacterial infections. the reintroduction of polymyxins for antimicrobial therapy  has been followed by an increase in reports of resistance among gram-negative bacteria. some bacteria, such as klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii, develop resistance to polymyxins in a process referred to as acquired resistance, whereas other bacteria, such as proteus spp., serratia spp., and burkholderia spp., are naturally resistant to these drugs. reports of polymyxin resistance in clinical isolates have recently increased, including acquired and intrinsically resistant pathogens. this increase is considered a serious issue, prompting concern due to the low number of currently  available effective antibiotics. this review summarizes current knowledge concerning the different strategies bacteria employ to resist the activities of polymyxins. gram-negative bacteria employ several strategies to protect themselves from polymyxin antibiotics (polymyxin b and colistin), including a variety of lipopolysaccharide (lps) modifications, such as modifications of lipid a with phosphoethanolamine and 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose, in addition to the use of efflux pumps, the formation of capsules and overexpression of the outer membrane protein oprh, which are all effectively regulated at the molecular level. the increased understanding of these mechanisms is extremely vital and timely to facilitate studies of antimicrobial peptides and find new potential drugs targeting clinically relevant gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == trends and correlation of antibacterial usage and bacterial resistance: time series analysis for antibacterial stewardship in a chinese teaching hospital (2009-2013).
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to describe the effect of antibacterial stewardship and evaluate the trends and correlation of antibacterial resistance and usage from 2009 to 2013 in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in northwest china. antibacterial usage was expressed as defined daily doses per 100 patients  per day (ddds/100 pds). hospital-wide population-level data and time series analysis were used to evaluate the trends and determine associations between antibacterial exposure and acquisition of resistance. yearly consumption of overall antibacterials significantly decreased from 66.54 to 28.08 ddds/100 pds (beta = -10.504, p < 0.01). the resistant rates of the five most frequently isolated species (including escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae) significantly decreased or remained stable, and none of them showed a statistically significant upward trend. the medical quality indicators got better or remained stable. autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) models demonstrated that the monthly resistance rate of p. aeruginosa to imipenem was strongly correlated with antipseudomonal carbapenems usage (beta = 34.94, p < 0.001), as did the correlation of p. aeruginosa to meropenem with antipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporins usage (beta = 32.76, p < 0.01) and k. pneumoniae  to amikacin with aminoglycosides usage (beta = 22.01, p < 0.001). the decreased antibacterial use paralleled the improved bacterial resistance without deteriorating medical quality indicators during antimicrobial stewardship. it also suggests that optimum antibiotic use is necessary to alleviate the threat posed by resistant microorganisms at the hospital level.

TI  == the molecular basis of beta-lactamase production in gram-negative bacteria from saudi arabia.
AB  == resistance to beta-lactams among gram-negative bacteria is a worldwide issue. increased prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producers and the dissemination of carbapenem-resistance genes are particularly concerning. esbl-producing strains are common in the kingdom of saudi arabia, particularly among the enterobacteriaceae, and carbapenem resistance is on the increase, especially among the non-fermenters. beta-lactamase production is a major mechanism of resistance to these agents and although beta-lactamase-producing strains have been documented in the kingdom, relatively few reports characterized the molecular basis of this production. nevertheless, available data suggest that ctx-m (ctx-m-15 in particular) is the predominant esbl in the enterobacteriaceae, with shv also being prevalent in klebsiella pneumoniae. carbapenem resistance in  the latter is mainly due to oxa-48 and ndm-1. in pseudomonas aeruginosa, veb-like enzymes are the most common esbls, and vim is the prevalent metallo-beta-lactamase. oxa-10 extended-spectrum enzymes are also frequent. per and ges esbls have been reported in acinetobacter baumannii, and oxacillinases (oxa-23 in particular) are the dominant carbapanamases in this species.

TI  == etiological factors causing lower respiratory tract infections isolated from hospitalized patients.
AB  == lower respiratory tract infections (lrti) account for 20-30 % of all hospital-acquired contagions. they are characterized by high mortality of hospitalized patients. the most serious form of lrti is pneumonia, and the most common etiological factors in such cases are bacteria. the article gives the analysis of bacterial flora samples obtained from lower respiratory tract of hospitalized patients. in vitro susceptibility of pathogens to selected antibiotics has also been assessed. we carried out a retrospective analysis of 1,171 bacterial strains isolated from 1,171 patients treated in clinics of the military institute of medicine in warsaw, poland. in most cases the samples were  collected from an endotracheal or tracheostomic tube (71.5 %) and from bronchoalveolar lavage (21.7 %). the most commonly isolated pathogens included acinetobacter baumannii (35.8 %), staphylococcus aureus (27.6 %), klebsiella pneumoniae (19.4 %), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.2 %). multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria exhibited 100 % susceptibility to colistin only. klebsiella pneumoniae esbl+ and acinetobacter baumannii were most susceptible to  carbapenems, while pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to ceftazidime. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were 100 % susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline. in conclusion, identifying the etiological factors causing infections of the lower respiratory tract and determining their drug-susceptibility is of key importance in empirical treatment.

TI  == one-step species-specific high resolution melting analysis for nosocomial bacteria detection.
AB  == nosocomial infections are a major public health concern worldwide. early and accurate identification of nosocomial pathogens which are often multidrug resistant is crucial for prompt treatment. hence, an alternative real-time polymerase chain reaction coupled with high resolution melting-curve analysis (hrma) was developed for identification of five nosocomial bacteria. this assay targets species-specific regions of each nosocomial bacteria and produced five distinct melt curves with each representing a particular bacterial species. the melting curves were characterized by peaks of 78.8 +/- 0.2 degrees c for acinetobacter baumannii, 82.7 +/- 0.2 degrees c for escherichia coli, 86.3 +/- 0.3 degrees c for klebsiella pneumoniae, 88.8 +/- 0.2 degrees c for pseudomonas aeruginosa and 74.6 +/- 02 degrees c for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the assay was able to specifically detect the five bacterial species with an overall detection limit of 2 x 10(-2) ng/mul. in conclusion, the hrm assay developed is a simple and rapid method for identification of the selected nosocomial pathogens.

TI  == arbekacin: another novel agent for treating infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == arbekacin sulfate (abk), an aminoglycoside antibiotic, was discovered in 1972 and was derived from dibekacin to stabilize many common aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. abk shows broad antimicrobial activities against not only gram-positive  bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) but also gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae. abk has been approved as an injectable formulation in japan since 1990, under the trade name habekacin, for the treatment of patients with pneumonia and sepsis caused by mrsa. the drug has been used in more than 250,000 patients, and its clinical benefit and safety have been proven over two decades. abk currently shows promise for the application for the treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections such as multidrug-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii because  of its synergistic effect in combination with beta-lactams.

TI  == isecp1-mediated transposition of blakpc into the chromosome of a clinical isolate of acinetobacter baumannii from puerto rico.
AB  == carbapenems are the last-resort antibiotics for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli. klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc) hydrolyses beta-lactam antibiotics including the carbapenems. kpcs have been detected in enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates worldwide associated with transposon tn4401 commonly located in plasmids. acinetobacter baumannii has become an important multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen capable of hydrolysing the carbapenem antibiotics. kpc-producing a. baumannii has so far only been reported in puerto rico. during a surveillance study, four kpc-producing a. baumannii with identical pulse type were identified  in a single institution. the objectives of this study were to characterize the kpc genetic background and the allelic diversity of one of the isolates. next-generation sequencing and multilocus sequence typing (mlst) were performed.  molecular characterization of the isolate demonstrated blakpc in tn4401b located  in the bacterial chromosome within a 26.5 kb dna fragment, which included a kq-like element (18.9 kb) very similar to that described previously in a k. pneumoniae plasmid and a 7.6 kb dna fragment with 98 % homology to a putative plasmid from yersinia pestis strain py-95. our data suggested that the 26.5 kb dna fragment harbouring blakpc was integrated in the chromosome by a transposition event mediated by the transposase of isecp1 found in the kq-like element. mlst showed a novel sequence type, st250. to our knowledge, this is the  first report of the identification of the genetic background of blakpc in a. baumannii.

TI  == microbiology, resistance patterns, and risk factors of mortality in ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in a northern thai tertiary-care university based general surgical intensive care unit.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) occurrence, causative pathogens, and resistance patterns in surgical intensive care units (sicu) are different between western and developing asian countries. in thailand, resistant  organisms have progressively increased in the last decade. however, the evidence  describing causes of vap and its outcomes, especially secondary to resistant pathogens, in asian developing countries' sicus is very limited. therefore, the objective of this study was to describe the incidence, pathogen characteristics,  and risk factors that impact mortality and patient survival following vap in a tertiary northern thai sicu. methods: between 2008 and 2012, vap occurred in a total of 150 patients in chiang mai university's general sicus (6.3+/-2.8 cases per 1,000 mechanical ventilator days). the following clinical data were collected from 46 patients who died and 104 patients who survived: microbiologic results, susceptible patterns, and survival status at hospital discharge. antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were classified as susceptible, multidrug resistant (mdr), extensively drug resistant (xdr), and pan-drug resistant (pdr). the hazard ratio (hr) was calculated for risk factor analysis. results: regarding the microbiology, gram negative organisms were the major pathogens (n=142, 94.7%). the first three most common organisms were acinetobacter baumannii (38.7% of all  organisms, mortality 41.4%), klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%, mortality 30.8%), and  pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.7%, mortality 16%) respectively. the most common gram  positive organism was staphylococcus aureus (4.0%, mortality 50%). the median day of vap occurrence were significantly different between the three groups (p<0.01): susceptible (day 4), mdr (day 5), and xdr (day 6.5). only half of all vap cases were caused by susceptible organisms. antibiotic resistance was demonstrated by 49.3% of the gram negative organisms and 62.5% of the gram positive organisms. extensive drug resistance was evident only in acinetobacter baumannii (30.6%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.3%). no pan-drug resistance was found during surveillance. the significant hr risk factors were age (p=0.03), resistant organisms (p=0.04), xdr (p=0.02), and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score (<0.01). acinetobacter baumannii (p=0.06) and intubation due  to severe sepsis (p=0.08) demonstrated a trend toward a significant increase in the hr. on the other hand, there were significantly decreased hrs in trauma patients (p=0.01). initial administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy had a tendency toward a significant decrease in the hr (p=0.08). conclusion: gram negative organisms were the primary cause of bacterial vap in chiang mai university's general sicu. resistant strains were present in half of all vap cases and were associated with the day of vap onset. regarding risk factors, age, acute physiology, chronic health evaluation ii score, resistant organisms (especially xdr), and being a non-trauma patient increased the risk of mortality.

TI  == activity of the type i signal peptidase inhibitor md3 against multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria alone and in combination with colistin.
AB  == objectives: effective treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections is increasingly challenging due to the spread of multidrug-resistant strains and a lack of new antimicrobials in development. bacterial type i signal peptidases (spases) represent a highly conserved and essential target for inhibition by novel compounds. spases are required for the effective processing of membrane translocated proteins involved in core functions related to metabolism, virulence and resistance. in this study we assessed the biochemical and functional activity of a novel synthetic inhibitor (md3) of spases against a wide range of gram-negative pathogens. methods: the activity and specificity of md3 for recombinant pseudomonas aeruginosa spase (lepb) and a genetically engineered lepb-regulatable strain were investigated. antimicrobial activity of the compound alone and in combination with outer membrane-permeabilizing agents (sodium hexametaphosphate, colistin) was also determined against a collection of p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. results: md3 was found to inactivate the p. aeruginosa lepb protein (ic50 10 mum), resulting in antimicrobial effects potentiated in the presence of colistin. md3 also demonstrated potent activity against wild-type and multidrug-resistant strains of a. baumannii and s. maltophilia with mics ranging  from 0.5 to 14 mg/l in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of colistin.  conclusions: md3 is a novel inhibitor of bacterial spase in a range of non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria. the antimicrobial activity is potentiated in combination with colistin and suggests that spase inhibition warrants further exploration as a basis for future mono or combination therapies.

TI  == gram-negative infections in pediatric and neonatal intensive care units of latin  america.
AB  == in order to review the epidemiology of gram-negative infections in the pediatric  and neonatal intensive care units (picus and nicus) of latin america a systematic search of pubmed and targeted search of scielo was performed to identify relevant articles published since 2005. independent cohort data indicated that overall infection rates were higher in latin american picus and nicus versus developed countries (range, 5%-37% vs 6%-15%, respectively). approximately one third of latin american patients with an acquired picu or nicu infection died, and crude mortality was higher among extremely low-birth-weight infants and those with an infection caused by gram-negative bacteria. in studies reporting > 100 isolates,  the frequency of gram-negative pathogens varied from 31% (colombia) to 63% (mexico), with klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli the predominant pathogens in almost all countries, and acinetobacter spp. and serratia spp. isolated sporadically. the activity of quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins against p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp., and enterobacteria was seriously compromised, coincident with a high prevalence of circulating extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. furthermore, we identified two observational studies conducted in chile and brazil reporting infections by p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii in picus, demonstrating resistance to carbapenems, and two outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae in colombia  and brazil. the endemicity of multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections in latin american picus and nicus is punctuated by intermittent clonal outbreaks. the problem may be alleviated by ensuring icus are less crowded, increasing staffing levels of better-trained health care personnel, and implementing antimicrobial stewardship and surveillance programs.

TI  == lethal synergy involving bicyclomycin: an approach for reviving old antibiotics.
AB  == background: one way to address the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance is to revive old compounds that may have intrinsic lethal activity that is obscured  by protective factors. bicyclomycin is an old inhibitor of the rho transcription  terminator that by itself shows little rapid lethal activity. however, bicyclomycin participates in bacteriostatic synergy, which raises the possibility that conditions for lethal synergy may exist, perhaps through a suppression of protective factors. methods: bicyclomycin was combined with bacteriostatic inhibitors of gene expression, and bactericidal activity was measured with several cultured gram-negative pathogens. results: when used alone, bicyclomycin  failed to rapidly kill growing cultures of escherichia coli; however, the additional presence of bacteriostatic concentrations of tetracycline, chloramphenicol or rifampicin led to rapid killing. four other pathogen species,  acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium and shigella dysenteriae, also exhibited enhanced killing when bicyclomycin was combined with tetracycline or rifampicin. this lethal synergy was achieved at low concentrations (slightly above the mic) for all agents tested in combinations. follow-up work with e. coli indicated that lethal synergy arose  from a blockage of transcription elongation. moreover, lethal synergy was reduced when bicyclomycin was added 60 min before tetracycline, suggesting that bicyclomycin induces a protective factor. conclusions: the action of bicyclomycin illustrates the potential present in a largely abandoned antibacterial agent; it  exhibits lethal synergy when coadministered with known, bacteriostatic inhibitors of gene expression. the identification of protective factors, which are currently uncharacterized, may reveal new ways to promote the lethal action of some old antibiotics.

TI  == rapid identification of carbapenemase genes in gram-negative bacteria with an oligonucleotide microarray-based assay.
AB  == rapid molecular identification of carbapenemase genes in gram-negative bacteria is crucial for infection control and prevention, surveillance and for epidemiological purposes. furthermore, it may have a significant impact upon determining the appropriate initial treatment and greatly benefit for critically  ill patients. a novel oligonucleotide microarray-based assay was developed to simultaneously detect genes encoding clinically important carbapenemases as well  as selected extended (esbl) and narrow spectrum (nsbl) beta-lactamases directly from clonal culture material within few hours. additionally, a panel of species specific markers was included to identify escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii/braakii, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii. the assay was tested using a panel of 117 isolates collected from urinary, blood and stool samples. for these isolates, phenotypic identifications  and susceptibility tests were available. an independent detection of carbapenemase, esbl and nsbl genes was carried out by various external reference  laboratories using pcr methods. in direct comparison, the microarray correctly identified 98.2% of the covered carbapenemase genes. this included blavim (13 out of 13), blagim (2/2), blakpc (27/27), blandm (5/5), blaimp-2/4/7/8/13/14/15/16/31 (10/10), blaoxa-23 (12/13), blaoxa-40-group (7/7), blaoxa-48-group (32/33), blaoxa-51 (1/1) and blaoxa-58 (1/1). furthermore, the test correctly identified additional beta-lactamases [blaoxa-1 (16/16), blaoxa-2 (4/4), blaoxa-9 (33/33), oxa-10 (3/3), blaoxa-51 (25/25), blaoxa-58 (2/2), ctx-m1/m15 (17/17) and blavim (1/1)]. in direct comparison to phenotypical identification obtained by vitek or  maldi-tof systems, 114 of 117 (97.4%) isolates, including acinetobacter baumannii (28/28), enterobacter spec. (5/5), escherichia coli (4/4), klebsiella pneumoniae  (62/63), klebsiella oxytoca (0/2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12/12), citrobacter freundii (1/1) and citrobacter braakii (2/2), were correctly identified by a panel of species specific probes. this assay might be easily extended, adapted and transferred to point of care platforms enabling fast surveillance, rapid detection and appropriate early treatment of infections caused by multiresistant  gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == carbapenem and multidrug resistance in gram-negative bacteria in a single centre  in italy: considerations on in vitro assay of active drugs.
AB  == in intensive care units (icus), the most important causes of nosocomial bacterial infections are mainly multidrug-resistant (mdr) and extensively drug-resistant (xdr) acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae strains. mortality related to these infections is very high due to lack of effective therapy and the severity of patient conditions. this study aimed to assess the prevalence of carbapenem resistance genes in 77 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria isolated from severe infections (bloodstream, pulmonary and urinary tract) during the period 1 january to 31 july 2013 in a general icu in catania, italy, and to examine their susceptibility to tigecycline and colistin using two different methods. in total, 52 a. baumannii belonging to the same sequence type (st) 2 clone and carrying the bla(oxa-23) gene as well as 25 k. pneumoniae carrying bla(kpc-3) were isolated. four distinct pulsotypes were identified in k. pneumoniae, which correlated with four distinct sts: st258 and st512, spread worldwide, and st147 and st395 detected for the first time in italy. a. baumannii isolates showed an xdr profile and were fully susceptible only to colistin; all kpc-producing k. pneumoniae isolates were mdr, whilst colistin was active against 19 of 25 strains. these results show that broth microdilution (bmd) is a reliable in vitro susceptibility test for colistin, above all k. pneumoniae, whilst both the gradient test and bmd are suitable for tigecycline susceptibility testing of  a. baumannii.

TI  == french regional surveillance program of carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli: results from a 2-year period.
AB  == in february 2011, the carb-lr group was created as a sentinel laboratory-based surveillance network to control the emergence of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli (cr gnb) in a french southern region. we report the epidemiological results of a 2-year study. all the gram-negative bacilli isolates detected in the different labs (hospital and community settings) of a french southern region and with reduced susceptibility to ertapenem and/or imipenem were characterised with regard to antibiotic resistance, bla genes content, repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-pcr) profiles and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). a total of 221 strains were analysed. acinetobacter baumannii was the most prevalent carbapenemase-producing bacteria, with a majority of oxa-23 producers (n = 37). one isolate co-produced oxa-23 and oxa-58  enzymes. klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) (oxa-48 producer: n = 29, kpc producer: n = 1), followed by escherichia coli (oxa-48 producer: n = 8, kpc producer: n = 1) and enterobacter cloacae (oxa-48 producer, n = 1). one isolate of pseudomonas aeruginosa produced a vim-1 carbapenemase. a clonal diversity of carbapenemase-producing k. pneumoniae and e. coli was noted with different mlsts. on the other hand, almost all oxa-23-producing a. baumannii strains belonged to the widespread st2/international clone ii. the link between the detection of cr gnb and a foreign country was less obvious, suggesting the beginning of a local cross-transmission. the number of cr gnb cases in our french southern region has  sharply increased very recently due to the diffusion of oxa-48 producers.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria causing nosocomial urinary tract infections in  an iranian referral teaching hospital.
AB  == objective: gram-negative bacilli are the most important cause of nosocomial urinary tract infections (utis). the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) enzymes is a common mechanism of resistance among these bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the rate of esbl producing gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial uti in a referral hospital as well as their susceptibility pattern to the most commonly used antibiotics. methods: in a prospective cross-sectional study performed over a 6-month period, urinary specimens obtained from hospitalized patients with documented culture-proved nosocomial uti (age range of 1-87 years). isolated aerobic gram-negative bacteria underwent further microbiologic tests for detection of esbl, as well as antimicrobial susceptibility test using kirby-bauer (disk diffusion) and e-test methods. findings: during the study period, 213 urine samples were detected to have growth of gram-negative organism. escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated organism (61%). esbl was detected in 102 isolates including 38.5% of e.  coli, 39.5% of klebsiella pneumonia, 88.5% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 100% of acinetobacter baumannii strains. imipenem and meropenem were the most effective antibiotics on e. coli and k. pneumoniae strains. p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii  strains showed high resistance to all tested antibiotics. conclusion: large numbers of gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial utis produce esbl with most  being multidrug-resistant. therefore, routine esbl detection testing and subsequent antibiogram with disk diffusion method could be useful to determine the best treatment options for uti.

TI  == an analysis of microbiota-targeted therapies in patients with avian influenza virus subtype h7n9 infection.
AB  == background: selective prophylactic decontamination of the digestive tract is a strategy for the prevention of secondary nosocomial infection in patients with avian influenza virus subtype h7n9 infection. our aim was to summarize the effectiveness of these therapies in re-establishing a stable and diverse microbial community, and reducing secondary infections. methods: comprehensive therapies were dependent on the individual clinical situation of subjects, and were divided into antiviral treatment, microbiota-targeted therapies, including pro- or pre-biotics and antibiotic usage, and immunotherapy. quantitative polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) were used for real-time monitoring of the predominant intestinal microbiome during treatment. clinical information about secondary infection was confirmed by analyzing pathogens isolated from clinical specimens. results: different antibiotics had similar effects on the gut microbiome, with a marked decrease and slow recovery of the bifidobacterium population. interestingly, most fecal microbial dgge profiles showed the relative stability of communities under the continual suppression of the same antibiotics, and significant changes when new antibiotics were introduced. moreover, we found no marked increase in c-reactive  protein, and no cases of bacteremia or pneumonia, caused by probiotic use in the  patients, which confirmed that the probiotics used in this study were safe for use in patients with h7n9 infection. approximately 72% of those who subsequently  suffered exogenous respiratory infection by candida species or multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae were older  than 60 years. the combination of probiotics and prebiotics with antibiotics seemed to fail in these patients. conclusions: elderly patients infected with the influenza a (h7n9) virus are considered a high-risk group for developing secondary bacterial infection. microbiota restoration treatment reduced the incidence of enterogenous secondary infection, but not exogenous respiratory infection. the prophylactic effects of microbiota restoration strategies for secondary infection were unsatisfactory in elderly and critically ill patients.

TI  == a broad-spectrum antibiofilm peptide enhances antibiotic action against bacterial biofilms.
AB  == biofilm-related infections account for at least 65% of all human infections, but  there are no available antimicrobials that specifically target biofilms. their elimination by available treatments is inefficient since biofilm cells are between 10- and 1,000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics than planktonic cells. here we describe the synergistic interactions, with different classes of antibiotics, of a recently characterized antibiofilm peptide, 1018, to potently prevent and eradicate bacterial biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) pathogens. combinations of peptide 1018 and the antibiotic ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or tobramycin were synergistic in 50% of assessments and decreased by 2- to 64-fold the concentration of antibiotic required to treat biofilms formed by pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, in flow cell biofilm studies, combinations of low, subinhibitory levels of the peptide (0.8 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (40 ng/ml) decreased dispersal and triggered cell death in mature p. aeruginosa biofilms. in addition, short-term treatments with the peptide in combination with ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation and reduced p. aeruginosa pa14 preexisting biofilms. pcr studies indicated that the peptide suppressed the expression of various antibiotic targets in biofilm cells. thus, treatment with the peptide represents a novel strategy to potentiate antibiotic activity against biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == risk factors for tracheobronchial acquisition of resistant gram-negative bacterial pathogens in mechanically ventilated icu patients.
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify risk factors for tracheobronchial acquisition with the most common resistant gram-negative bacteria in the intensive care unit (icu) during the first week after intubation and mechanical ventilation. tracheobronchial and oropharyngeal cultures were obtained at admission, after 48 hours, and after 7 days of mechanical ventilation. patient characteristics, interventions, and antibiotic usage were recorded. among 71 eligible patients with two negative bronchial cultures for resistant gram-negative bacteria (at admission and within 48 hours), 41 (58%) acquired bronchial resistant gram-negative bacteria by day 7. acquisition strongly correlated with presence of the same pathogens in the oropharynx: acinetobacter baumannii [odds ratio (or) = 20.2, 95% confidence interval (ci): 5.5-73.6], klebsiella pneumoniae (or = 8.0, 95% ci: 1.9-33.6), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (or = 27, 95%: ci 2.7-273). bronchial acquisition with resistant k. pneumoniae also was associated with chronic liver disease (or = 3.9, 95% ci: 1.0-15.3), treatment with aminoglycosides (or = 4.9, 95% ci: 1.4-18.2), tigecycline (or = 4.9, 95% ci: 1.4-18.2), and linezolid (or = 3.9, 95% ci: 1.1-15.0). in multivariate analysis, treatment with tigecycline and chronic liver disease were  independently associated with bronchial resistant k. pneumoniae acquisition. our  results show a high incidence of tracheobronchial acquisition with resistant gram-negative microorganisms in the bronchial tree of newly intubated patients. oropharynx colonization with the same pathogens and specific antibiotics use were independent risk factors.

TI  == epidemiology of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii in mediterranean countries.
AB  == the emergence and global spread of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii are of great concern to health services worldwide. these  beta-lactamases hydrolyse almost all beta-lactams, are plasmid-encoded, and are easily transferable among bacterial species. they are mostly of the kpc, vim, imp, ndm, and oxa-48 types. their current extensive spread worldwide in enterobacteriaceae is an important source of concern. infections caused by these  bacteria have limited treatment options and have been associated with high mortality rates. carbapenemase producers are mainly identified among klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and a. baumannii and still mostly in hospital settings and rarely in the community. the mediterranean region is of interest due to a great diversity and population mixing. the prevalence of carbapenemases is particularly high, with this area constituting one of the most important reservoirs. the types of carbapenemase vary among countries, partially depending  on the population exchange relationship between the regions and the possible reservoirs of each carbapenemase. this review described the epidemiology of carbapenemases produced by enterobacteria and a. baumannii in this part of the world highlighting the worrisome situation and the need to screen and detect these enzymes to prevent and control their dissemination.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates in aerobic gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in vietnam: report from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart 2009-2011).
AB  == treatment options for multidrug-resistant pathogens remain problematic in many regions and individual countries, warranting ongoing surveillance and analysis. limited antimicrobial susceptibility information is available for pathogens from  vietnam. this study determined the bacterial susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative pathogens of intra-abdominal infections among patients in vietnam during 2009-2011. a total of 905 isolates were collected from 4 medical centers in this investigation as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends. antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) rates among the appropriate species were determined by a central laboratory using clinical and laboratory standards institute methods. among the species collected, escherichia coli (48.1% esbl-positive) and klebsiella pneumoniae (39.5% esbl-positive) represented the majority (46.4%) of the isolates submitted for this study. ertapenem mic90 values were lowest for these 2 species at 0.12 and 0.25mug/ml and remained unchanged for esbl-positive isolates. imipenem mic90 values were also the same for all isolates and esbl-positive strains at 0.25 and 0.5mug/ml, respectively. ertapenem mic90 values for additional species with sufficient numbers for analysis, including enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 1, 0.06, >4, and >4mug/ml, respectively. analysis of beta-lactamases in a subset of 132 phenotypically esbl-positive enterobacteriaceae demonstrated that ctx-m variants, particularly ctx-m-27 and ctx-m-15, were the predominant enzymes. high resistance rates in vietnam hospitals dictate continuous monitoring as antimicrobial inactivating enzymes continue to spread throughout asia and globally.

AB  == background: the emergences of antimicrobial-resistances have become an important  issue in global healthcares. limitations in surveying hinder the actual estimates of resistance in many countries. the aim: the present study was designed to retrospectically survey antimicrobial susceptibility for resistance profiling of  dominant pathogens in a tertiary-care center in buraidah, saudi arabia from january-2011 to december-2011. materials and methods: the design was cross-sectional and spanned records of a 1000 bacterial non-related isolates. antibiograms were based on the 2012 clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines. results: showed that staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii,  klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and escherichia coli, were the most resistant. all isolates of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were resistant to penicillin (100%), and oxacillin with 52%, 75%, and 82%, respectively. interestingly, an increasing trend of resistance-pattern was seen for the three species against gentamicin 26%, 50%, 68% ciprofloxacin 22%, 50%, 68%, tetracycline 30%, 44%, 27%, erythromycin 26%, 64%, 73%, and clindamycin 20%, 47%, 50% suggesting potential between-species transfer of resistances. acinetobacter baumannii was resistances  to all antibiotics tested including ciprofloxacin (90%), ceftazidime (89%), cefepime (67%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (66%), amikacin (63%), gentamicin (51%), tetracycline (43%), piperacillin-tazobactam (42%), and imipenem (9%). a similar pattern was seen by p. aeruginosa. furthermore, a typical pattern of resistance in k. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms was observed. conclusion: we have shown staphylococci, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enteric bacteria were the most resistant species in this region.

TI  == polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride shows bactericidal advantages over chlorhexidine digluconate against eskape bacteria.
AB  == more information regarding the bactericidal properties of polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride (phmg) against clinically important antibiotic-resistant  eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) pathogens needs to be provided for its uses in infection control. the bactericidal properties of phmg and chlorhexidine digluconate (chg) were compared based on their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), minimum bactericidal concentrations, and time-course-killing curves against clinically important antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant eskape pathogens. results showed  that phmg exhibited significantly higher bactericidal activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter spp. than chg. a slight bactericidal advantage over chg was obtained against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, ciprofloxacin- and levofloxacin-resistant acinetobacter spp., and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. in previous reports, phmg had higher antimicrobial activity against almost all tested gram-negative bacteria and several gram-positive bacteria than chg using mic test. these studies support the further development of covalently bound phmg in sterile-surface materials and the incorporation of phmg in novel disinfectant formulas.

TI  == high dose tigecycline in critically ill patients with severe infections due to multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  == introduction: the high incidence of multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria among patients admitted to icus has determined an increase of tigecycline (tgc) use for the treatment of severe infections. many concerns have been raised about the efficacy of this molecule and increased dosages have been proposed. our purpose is to investigate tgc safety and efficacy at higher than standard doses. methods: we conducted a retrospective study of prospectively collected data in the icu of  a teaching hospital in rome. data from all patients treated with tgc for a microbiologically confirmed infection were analyzed. the safety profile and efficacy of high dosing regimen use were investigated. results: over the study period, 54 patients (pts) received tgc at a standard dose (sd group: 50 mg every  12 hours) and 46 at a high dose (hd group: 100 mg every 12 hours). carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter.baumannii (blaoxa-58 and blaoxa-23 genes) and  klebsiella pneumoniae (blakpc-3 gene) were the main isolated pathogens (n = 79).  there were no patients requiring tgc discontinuation or dose reduction because of adverse events. in the ventilation-associated pneumonia population (vap) subgroup (63 patients: 30 received sd and 33 hd), the only independent predictor of clinical cure was the use of high tigecycline dose (odds ratio (or) 6.25; 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.59 to 24.57; p = 0.009) whilst initial inadequate antimicrobial treatment (iiat) (or 0.18; 95% ci 0.05 to 0.68; p = 0.01) and higher sequential organ failure assessment (sofa) score (or 0.66; 95% ci 0.51 to  0.87; p = 0.003) were independently associated with clinical failure. conclusions: tgc was well tolerated at a higher than standard dose in a cohort of critically ill patients with severe infections. in the vap subgroup the high-dose regimen was associated with better outcomes than conventional administration due  to gram-negative mdr bacteria.

TI  == efficacy of surface disinfectant cleaners against emerging highly resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background: worldwide, the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria is a clinical problem. surface disinfectant cleaners (sdcs) that are effective against these bacteria are needed for use in high risk areas around patients and on multi-touch surfaces. we determined the efficacy of several sdcs  against clinically relevant bacterial species with and without common types of multidrug resistance. methods: bacteria species used were atcc strains; clinical  isolates classified as antibiotic-susceptible; and multi-resistant clinical isolates from klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens  (all oxa-48 and kpc-2); acinetobacter baumannii (oxa-23); pseudomonas aeruginosa  (vim-1); and achromobacter xylosoxidans (atcc strain). experiments were carried out according to en 13727:2012 in quadruplicate under dirty conditions. the five  evaluated sdcs were based on alcohol and an amphoteric substance (aas), an oxygen-releaser (or), surface-active substances (sas), or surface-active-substances plus aldehydes (sasa; two formulations). bactericidal concentrations of sdcs were determined at two different contact times. efficacy was defined as a log10 >/= 5 reduction in bacterial cell count. results: sdcs based on aas, or, and sas were effective against all six species irrespective of  the degree of multi-resistance. the sasa formulations were effective against the  bacteria irrespective of degree of multi-resistance except for one of the four p. aeruginosa isolates (vim-1). we found no general correlation between sdc efficacy and degree of antibiotic resistance. conclusions: sdcs were generally effective against gram-negative bacteria with and without multidrug resistance. sdcs are therefore suitable for surface disinfection in the immediate proximity of patients. single bacterial isolates, however, might have reduced susceptibility to selected biocidal agents.

TI  == tigecycline in treatment of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacillus urinary tract infections: a systematic review.
AB  == objectives: to review cases of multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacillus urinary tract infections (utis) treated with tigecycline and the literature related to this subject. methods: we performed a systematic review of the literature identifying patients with mdr gram-negative bacillus utis treated with tigecycline. results: fourteen cases describing treatment of utis caused by mdr gram-negative bacilli with tigecycline are reviewed. favourable clinical outcomes were noted in 11 of 14 cases. an initial favourable microbiological outcome was noted in 12 cases. post-treatment cultures in two cases were positive for tigecycline-resistant organisms. conclusions: the clinical efficacy of tigecycline for treatment of utis has not been extensively evaluated. based on the available literature, tigecycline appears to have efficacy in some patients with mdr gram-negative bacillus utis. further research in this area is needed to  fully elucidate the role of tigecycline in treating such patients.

TI  == a survey of five broad-host-range plasmids in gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients.
AB  == objectives: to learn the prevalence of the primary classical broad-host-range (bhr) inca/c, incn, incp, incq, and incw plasmids in dominant gram-negative bacilli from inpatients in a teaching hospital in southern china. methods: a multiplex polymerase chain reaction based on the replicons of bhr inca/c, incn, incp, incq, and incw plasmids was developed and used to determine these bhr plasmids. the difference in prevalence rates among the different species from three specimens was evaluated by a binary logistic regression model and the differences between multidrug-resistant organisms (mdro) and non-mdro were assessed using a chi-square test. results: the average positive detection percentages of the replicons were 4.3%, 3.7%, 3.0%, 2.6%, and 1.9%, respectively, for incn, incp, incq, incw, and inca/c in descending order. the distribution of all five bhr plasmids did not differ significantly between specimens collected from wounds and urine, although both were significantly higher than those of sputum. the prevalence rates of all five bhr plasmids in mdros were significantly higher than those in non-mdro for enterobacteriaceae; however, no significant difference was seen in non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (nfgnb). conclusions: bhr inca/c, incn, incp, incq, and incw plasmids, which occur more often in bacilli from wound and urine specimens than those of sputum, are widespread in escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from inpatients. the prevalence rates in mdro are higher than those in non-mdro for enterobacteriaceae but not significantly different for nfgnb.

TI  == antimicrobial consumption and resistance in five gram-negative bacterial species  in a hospital from 2003 to 2011.
AB  == background: the misuse of antimicrobial agents increases drug resistance in bacteria. methods: the correlation between antimicrobial agent consumption and related resistance in the gram-negative bacteria acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis was analyzed during the period 2003-2011. results: among these five bacteria, overall e. coli and k. pneumoniae were more commonly isolated from bloodstream than the other species. regarding enterobacteriaceae, e. coli and k.  pneumoniae showed annual increases of resistance to the tested antimicrobial agents; conversely, p. mirabilis exhibited reduced resistance to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and cefepime. in contrast to the relatively low antimicrobial resistance in p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii revealed high resistance, which was over 85% resistant rate to the tested antimicrobial agents and over 80% carbapenem resistance in 2011. e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis differed  in development of antimicrobial resistance after consumption of the antimicrobial agents. k. pneumoniae developed resistance to all antimicrobial groups, whereas resistance in p. mirabilis was not related to any antimicrobial consumption. p. aeruginosa developed resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials and aminoglycosides, whereas a. baumanii developed resistance to carbapenems after their use. conclusion: the development of antimicrobial resistance was related to antimicrobial agents and bacterial species.

TI  == development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-lipl32-coupled gold nanoparticles for leptospira detection.
AB  == detection of antibody specific to leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. however, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. molecular techniques  are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. in this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to lipl32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic leptospira. this coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for leptospira detection. we demonstrated that the sensitivity of leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). there was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic leptospira, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group b, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. these data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to lipl32 could  be used for leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.

TI  == broad-spectrum anti-biofilm peptide that targets a cellular stress response.
AB  == bacteria form multicellular communities known as biofilms that cause two thirds of all infections and demonstrate a 10 to 1000 fold increase in adaptive resistance to conventional antibiotics. currently, there are no approved drugs that specifically target bacterial biofilms. here we identified a potent anti-biofilm peptide 1018 that worked by blocking (p)ppgpp, an important signal in biofilm development. at concentrations that did not affect planktonic growth,  peptide treatment completely prevented biofilm formation and led to the eradication of mature biofilms in representative strains of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial pathogens including pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium and burkholderia cenocepacia. low levels of the peptide led to biofilm dispersal, while higher doses triggered biofilm cell death. we hypothesized that the peptide acted to inhibit a common stress response in target species, and that the stringent response, mediating (p)ppgpp synthesis through the enzymes rela and spot, was targeted. consistent with this, increasing (p)ppgpp synthesis by addition of serine hydroxamate or over-expression of rela led to reduced susceptibility to the peptide. furthermore, rela and spot mutations blocking production of (p)ppgpp replicated the effects of the peptide, leading to a reduction of biofilm formation in the four tested target species. also, eliminating (p)ppgpp expression after two days of biofilm growth by removal of arabinose from a strain expressing rela behind an arabinose-inducible promoter, reciprocated the effect of peptide added at the same time, leading to loss of biofilm. nmr and chromatography studies showed that the peptide acted on cells to cause degradation of (p)ppgpp within 30 minutes, and in vitro directly interacted with  ppgpp. we thus propose that 1018 targets (p)ppgpp and marks it for degradation in cells. targeting (p)ppgpp represents a new approach against biofilm-related drug  resistance.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of gram-negative bacilli isolated from pediatric patients with nosocomial bloodstream infections in a mexican tertiary care hospital.
AB  == background: gram-negative bacilli are the most common bacteria causing nosocomial bloodstream infections (nbsis) in latin american countries. methods: the antibiotic resistance profiles of gram-negative bacilli isolated from blood cultures in pediatric patients with nbsis over a 3-year period in a tertiary care pediatric hospital in mexico city were determined using the vitek-2 system. sixteen antibiotics were tested to ascertain the resistance rate and the minimum  inhibitory concentration using the clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth micro-dilution method as a reference. results: a total of 931 isolates were recovered from 847 clinically significant episodes of nbsi. of these, 477 (51.2%) were caused by gram-negative bacilli. the most common gram-negative bacilli found were klebsiella pneumoniae (30.4%), escherichia coli (18.9%), enterobacter cloacae (15.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.9%), and acinetobacter baumannii (4.6%). more than 45 and 60% of the k. pneumoniae and e. coli isolates, respectively, were resistant to cephalosporins, and 64% of the e. coli isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones. a. baumannii exhibited low rates of resistance to antibiotics tested. in the e. cloacae and p. aeruginosa isolates, no rates of resistance higher than 38% were observed. conclusions: in this study, we found that the proportion of nbsis due to antibiotic-resistant organisms is increasing in a tertiary care pediatric hospital of mexico.

TI  == paenibacterin, a novel broad-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic, neutralises endotoxins and promotes survival in a murine model of pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced sepsis.
AB  == paenibacterin, produced by paenibacillus thiaminolyticus osy-se, is active both against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. paenibacterin showed relatively low cytotoxicity against a human kidney cell line (atcc crl-2190), with a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50)>/=109mug/ml. the cationic paenibacterin molecule binds to the negatively charged gram-negative endotoxins in vitro, suggesting that paenibacterin can neutralise lipopolysaccharides. in a murine septic shock model, two 500mug doses of paenibacterin significantly increased the survival of mice challenged with a lethal level of p. aeruginosa. considering that paenibacterin is effective against many strains of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, this study suggests that  this antimicrobial agent is a promising candidate as a new drug.

TI  == in vitro activity of the siderophore monosulfactam bal30072 against contemporary  gram-negative pathogens from new york city, including multidrug-resistant isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of bal30072 was assessed against clinical isolates from nyc hospitals, including isolates from a citywide surveillance study and a collection of isolates with well-characterised resistance mechanisms. bal30072 was the most  active beta-lactam against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50/90, 0.25/1 mug/ml), acinetobacter baumannii (mic50/90, 4/>64 mug/ml) and kpc-possessing klebsiella pneumoniae (mic50/90, 4/>64 mug/ml). combining bal30072 with meropenem resulted in a >/= 4-fold decrease in the bal30072 mic90 both for a. baumannii and k. pneumoniae. for isolates with a bal30072 mic>4 mug/ml, addition of a sub-mic concentration of colistin resulted in a four-fold decrease in the bal30072 mic in 44% of p. aeruginosa, 82% of a. baumannii and 23% of k. pneumoniae. using sub-mic concentrations, bal30072 plus colistin was bactericidal against 4 of 11 isolates  in time-kill studies. bal30072 mics were frequently lower for p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae when tested using mueller-hinton agar versus iso-sensitest agar or  mueller-hinton broth. against the well-characterised isolates, reduced susceptibility to bal30072 correlated with mexa and mexx expression (p. aeruginosa), adeb expression (a. baumannii) and presence of shv-type esbls (a. baumannii and k. pneumoniae). bal30072 shows promising activity against contemporary gram-negatives, including mdr p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii and k. pneumoniae. enhanced activity was often present when bal30072 was combined with meropenem or colistin. bal30072 mics were influenced by the testing method, particularly for p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae. further in vivo studies are warranted to determine the potential clinical utility of bal30072 alone and combined with other agents.

AB  == the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacterial pathogens poses a major threat for human health. in recent years, genome sequencing has unveiled many poorly expressed antibiotic clusters in actinomycetes. here, we report a well-defined ecological collection of >800 actinomycetes obtained from sites in the himalaya and qinling mountains, and we used these in a concept study to see how efficiently antibiotics can be elicited against mdr pathogens isolated recently from the clinic. using 40 different growth conditions, 96 actinomycetes  were identified - predominantly streptomyces - that produced antibiotics with efficacy against the mdr clinical isolates referred to as eskape pathogens: enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or enterobacter cloacae. antimicrobial activities that fluctuated strongly with growth conditions were correlated with specific compounds, including borrelidin, resistomycin, carbomethoxy-phenazine, and 6,7,8- and 5,6,8-trimethoxy-3-methylisocoumarin, of which the latter was not  described previously. our work provided insights into the potential of actinomycetes as producers of drugs with efficacy against clinical isolates that  have emerged recently and also underlined the importance of targeting a specific  pathogen.

AB  == background: routine microbiologic surveillance is a method of infection control,  but its clinical significance in transplant recipients is not known. we analyzed  microbiologic data to evaluate the influence of cultured microorganisms between the point of surveillance and infectious episodes in liver transplant recipients. methods: we performed surveillance culture for sputum and peritoneal fluid in liver transplant recipients from january 2009 to december 2011, at the time of transplantation (t1), 5 days (t2), and 10 days (t3) postoperatively. results: of  the 179 recipients, 32.9% had a positive sputum culture result and 37.4% had a positive peritoneal culture result during surveillance. in the culture surveillance of sputum, 37 organisms were isolated from 35 recipients at t1, and  the most common organism was staphylococcus aureus (n = 13). at t2, 45 organisms  were isolated from 39 recipients, including klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10), s aureus (n = 8), and acinetobacter baumannii (n = 6). at t3, 18 organisms were isolated from 15 patients, including stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5) and k pneumonia (n = 4). in the peritoneal fluid, 11 organisms were isolated from 10 recipients at t1, including pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2) and enterococcus species (n = 2). at t2, 39 organisms were isolated from 36 recipients, including  coagulase-negative staphylococcus species (cns; n = 8) and enterococcus species (n = 7). at t3, 54 organisms were isolated from 51 recipients, including cns (n = 17) and candida species (n = 8). among the 59 patients with positive culture results for sputum surveillance, 16.9% developed pneumonia caused by the same organisms. among the 67 patients with positive peritoneal fluid culture, 16.4% developed an intra-abdominal infection caused by the same organisms cultured. the recipients with positive surveillance culture had a higher risk of pneumonia (20.3% [12/59] vs 1.6% [2/120]; p < .001) and intra-abdominal infection (31.3% [21/67] vs 18.7% [21/112]; p = .05). conclusions: periodic microbiologic surveillance may be useful in the prediction of post-transplantation pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection and could offer a potential target for empirical antimicrobial therapy in cases of infection.

TI  == multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant gram-negative pathogens: current and emerging therapeutic approaches.
AB  == introduction: in the era of multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant (xdr) and even pandrug-resistant gram-negative microorganisms, the medical community is facing the threat of untreatable infections particularly those caused by carbapenemase-producing bacteria, that is, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. therefore, all the presently available antibiotics, as well as for the near future compounds, are presented and discussed. areas covered: current knowledge concerning mechanisms of action, in vitro activity and interactions, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy and toxicity issues for revived and novel antimicrobial agents overcoming current resistance mechanisms, including colistin, tigecycline, fosfomycin, temocillin, carbapenems, and antibiotics still under development for  the near future such as plazomicin, eravacycline and carbapenemase inhibitors is  discussed. expert opinion: colistin is active in vitro and effective in vivo against xdr carbapenemase-producing microorganisms in the critically ill host, whereas tigecycline, with the exception of p. aeruginosa, has a similar spectrum  of activity. the efficacy of combination therapy in bacteremias and ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by k. pneumoniae carbapenemase producers seems to be obligatory, whereas in cases of p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii its efficacy is questionable. fosfomycin, which is active against p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae, although promising, shares poor experience in xdr infections. the  in vivo validity of the newer potent compounds still necessitates the evaluation  of phase iii clinical trials particularly in xdr infections.

AB  == the amikacin-fosfomycin inhalation system (afis) is a combination of 2 antibiotics and an in-line nebulizer delivery system that is being developed for  adjunctive treatment of pneumonia caused by gram-negative organisms in patients on mechanical ventilation. afis consists of a combination of amikacin and fosfomycin solutions at a 5:2 ratio (amikacin, 3 ml at 100 mg/ml; fosfomycin, 3 ml at 40 mg/ml) and the pari investigational eflow inline system. in this antibiotic potentiation study, the antimicrobial activities of amikacin and fosfomycin, alone and in a 5:2 combination, were assessed against 62 gram-negative pathogens from a worldwide antimicrobial surveillance collection (sentry). the amikacin mics for 62 isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were >/=32 mug/ml (intermediate or resistant according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute [clsi]; resistant according to the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing [eucast]). each isolate was tested against amikacin (0.25 to 1,024 mug/ml), fosfomycin (0.1 to 409.6 mug/ml), and amikacin-fosfomycin (at a 5:2 ratio) using clsi reference agar dilution methods. the median mic values for amikacin and fosfomycin against the 62 isolates each decreased 2-fold with the amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) combination from that with either antibiotic alone. interactions between amikacin and fosfomycin differed by isolate and ranged from  no detectable interaction to high potentiation. the amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) combination reduced the amikacin concentration required to inhibit all 62 isolates from >1,024 to </= 256 mug/ml and reduced the required fosfomycin concentration from 204.8 to 102.4 mug/ml. these results support continued development of the amikacin-fosfomycin combination for aerosolized administration, where high drug levels can be achieved.

AB  == in the presence of septic shock, every hour in delaying the administration of effective antibiotics is associated with a measurable increase in mortality. this is especially true for neutropenic patients with septic shock.1 as there is a higher incidence of involving multi-drug resistant pathogens for neutropenic patients, the decision on antibiotics regime remains a challenge for physicians.2 immunosuppression and previous antibacterial use are factors that promote the spread of multi-drug resistant pathogens, and the possibility of co-existing multi-drug resistant pathogens should be suspected when treating patients with these risk factors who developed refractory shock. here we present a case with neutropenic fever and refractory shock whose blood culture yielded multi-drug resistant acinetobacter baumannii and carbapenem- resistant klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative pathogens in saudi arabia.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacteria is a worldwide problem, including in the kingdom of saudi arabia, with major concerns regarding pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterobacteriaceae. although over half of the isolates of p. aeruginosa remain susceptible to carbapenems, quinolones, and aminoglycosides in most reports from saudi arabia, resistance is  on increase, with a worrying high prevalence of multidrug resistance. ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and aminoglycosides remain active against a. baumannii isolates in some studies from the kingdom, but recent data suggest increased resistance. carbapenems are now the treatment of choice for acinetobacter infections but their activity too is being eroded. among enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter spp. are the most clinically relevant species. rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production by these species vary among studies but are generally high in saudi arabia, with many esbl-producing isolates multiresistant  to other agents, except carbapenems and nitrofurantoin. a similar pattern is seen for klebsiella, although with more resistance to quinolones, aminoglycosides, and to nitrofurantoin than in e. coli. enterobacter is commonly resistant to penicillins, monobactams, and cephalosporins but mostly susceptible to carbapenems. carbapenemases are beginning to emerge in enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro colistin susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa and  acinetobacter baumannii strains at a tertiary care centre in western turkey.
AB  == multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria are an important issue in intensive care units worldwide. colistin, one of the earliest polymyxin antibiotics, was once widely used for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections. however, its use is now limited due to concerns over nephrotoxicity. the appearance of multidrug-resistant species, including a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa, has led to the re-emergence of this class of drugs. the aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa isolates to colistin and other antibiotics. the antimicrobial susceptibility of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa isolates to colistin and other antibiotics was evaluated between january 2011 and october 2012 at tepecik education and research hospital in izmir, turkey. clinical isolates were identified using an automatized vitek 2.0 system. colistin susceptibility was measured by e-test; the susceptibility profiles of other antibiotics were evaluated using the kirby bauer disk-diffusion method. a total of 149 isolates were included in the study, consisting of 98 a. baumannii and 51 p. aeruginosa isolates. the mics of colistin against a. baumannii were 0.125-2.0 mcg/ml, and 0.25-2.0 mcg/ml against p. aeruginosa; all multidrug-resistant strains examined in this study were susceptible to colistin. recently, colistin has re-emerged as an effective treatment for infections due to multidrug-resistant a. baumannii, p. aeruginosa,  and klebsiella pneumoniae. all isolates examined in this study were susceptible to colistin, suggesting it could be a viable alternative for the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant strains.

AB  == loss of the skin barrier facilitates the colonization of underlying tissues with  various bacteria, where they form biofilms that protect them from antibiotics and host responses. such wounds then become chronically infected. topical antimicrobials are a major component of chronic wound therapy, yet currently available topical antimicrobials vary in their effectiveness on biofilm-forming pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the efficacy of next science wound gel technology (nxtsc), a novel topical agent designed to kill planktonic bacteria, penetrate biofilms, and kill the bacteria within. in vitro quantitative analysis, using strains isolated from wounds, showed that nxtsc inhibited biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae by inhibiting bacterial growth. the gel formulation nxtsc-g5, when applied to biofilms preformed by these pathogens, reduced the numbers of bacteria present by 7 to 8 log10 cfu/disc or cfu/g. in vivo, nxtsc-g5 prevented biofilm formation for 72 h when applied at the time of wounding and infection and eliminated biofilm infection when applied 24 h after wounding and infection. storage of nxtsc-g5 at  room temperature for 9 months did not diminish its efficacy. these results establish that nxtsc is efficacious in vitro and in vivo in preventing infection  and biofilm development by different wound pathogens when applied immediately and in eliminating biofilm infection already established by these pathogens. this novel antimicrobial agent, which is nontoxic and has a usefully long shelf life,  shows promise as an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of biofilm-related infections.

TI  == inhibition of rnd-type efflux pumps confers the ftsz-directed prodrug txy436 with activity against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == infections caused by gram-negative bacterial pathogens are often difficult to treat, with the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains further restricting clinical treatment options. as a result, there is an acute need for the development of new therapeutic agents active against gram-negative bacteria. the  bacterial protein ftsz has recently been demonstrated to be a viable antibacterial target for treating infections caused by the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus in mouse model systems. here, we investigate whether an ftsz-directed prodrug (txy436) that is effective against s. aureus can also target gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli. we find that the conversion product of txy436 (pc190723) can bind e. coli ftsz and inhibit its polymerization/bundling in vitro. however, pc190723 is intrinsically inactive against wild-type e. coli, with this inactivity being derived from the actions of the efflux pump acrab. mutations in e. coli acrab render the mutant bacteria susceptible to txy436. we further show that chemical inhibition of acrab in e. coli, as well as its homologs in klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii, confers all three gram-negative pathogens with susceptibility to txy436. we demonstrate that the activity of txy436 against e. coli and k. pneumoniae is bactericidal in nature. evidence for ftsz-targeting and inhibition  of cell division in gram-negative bacteria by txy436 is provided by the induction of a characteristic filamentous morphology when the efflux pump has been inhibited as well as by the lack of functional z-rings upon txy436 treatment.

TI  == probing the penetration of antimicrobial polymyxin lipopeptides into gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the dry antibiotic development pipeline coupled with the emergence of multidrug resistant gram-negative 'superbugs' has driven the revival of the polymyxin lipopeptide antibiotics. polymyxin resistance implies a total lack of antibiotics for the treatment of life-threatening infections. the lack of molecular imaging probes that possess native polymyxin-like antibacterial activity is a barrier to  understanding the resistance mechanisms and the development of a new generation of polymyxin lipopeptides. here we report the regioselective modification of the  polymyxin b core scaffold at the n-terminus with the dansyl fluorophore to generate an active probe that mimics polymyxin b pharmacologically. time-lapse laser scanning confocal microscopy imaging of the penetration of probe (1) into gram-negative bacterial cells revealed that the probe initially accumulates in the outer membrane and subsequently penetrates into the inner membrane and finally the cytoplasm. the implementation of this polymyxin-mimetic probe will advance the development of platforms for the discovery of novel polymyxin lipopeptides with efficacy against polymyxin-resistant strains.

TI  == prevalence and risk factors for antibiotic-resistant community-associated bloodstream infections.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance is increasing in many community settings. the purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of antibiotic resistant community-associated bloodstream infections (ca-bsis) present on hospital admissions to identify risk factors for acquiring resistant versus susceptible ca-bsis and to describe the incidence of concurrent infections with ca-bsis. methods: we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from one community, one pediatric, and two tertiary/quaternary care hospitals within an academically affiliated network in the borough of manhattan in new york, ny, from 2006 to 2008. the ca-bsis present at hospital admission were defined as bsis occurring within the first 48h of hospitalization. infections and patient characteristics were identified using data available from patients' electronic medical records and discharge records. results: in total, 1677 ca-bsis were identified. staphylococcus aureus had the largest proportion of resistance (41.2%), followed by enterococcal species (24.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.2%), streptococcus pneumoniae (16.6%), acinetobacter baumannii (10.0%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (9.9%). significant predictors of resistance were prior residence in a skilled nursing facility (or, 2.55; 95% ci, 1.39-4.70), advanced age (1.01; 1.002-1.02), presence of malignancy (0.58; 0.37-0.91), prior hospitalization (1.62; 1.17-2.23), a weighted charlson score (1.09; 1.02-1.17) for s. aureus, presence of malignancy (1.82; 1.004-3.30), prior hospitalizations  (2.03; 1.12-3.38) for enterococcal species, and younger age for s. pneumoniae (p=0.02). urinary tract infections were the most common concurrent infection (n=45/87, 51.7%). conclusion: over 27% of the ca-bsis present on admission were antibiotic resistant. understanding the prevalence and risk factors for ca-bsis may help improve empiric antibiotic therapy and outcomes for patients with community-onset infections.

TI  == an emerging public health problem: acquired carbapenemase-producing microorganisms are present in food-producing animals, their environment, companion animals and wild birds.
AB  == worldwide, the emergence and global spread of microorganisms with acquired carbapenemases is of great concern. the reservoirs for such organisms are increasing, not only in hospitals, but also in the community and environment. a new and important development is the presence of such organisms in livestock, companion animals and wildlife. during the last three years, carbapenemase-producing escherichia coli, salmonella spp. (vim-1 producers) and acinetobacter spp. (producing oxa-23 and ndm-1) in livestock animals (poultry, cattle and swine) and their environment have been reported. in addition, the isolation of ndm-1-producing e. coli, oxa-48 in e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae or oxa-23 in acinetobacter spp. from companion animals (cats, dogs or horses) has also been observed. other reports have described the presence of ndm-1-producing  salmonella isolated from wild birds, as well as oxa-23-like-producing acinetobacter baumannii in ectoparasites. however, until now carbapenemase producers from foods have not been detected. for humans in contrast carbapenem-producing salmonella isolates are increasingly reported. the real prevalence of carbapenemase-encoding genes in zoonotic bacteria or commensals from animals is unknown. consequently, there is a need for intensified surveillance on the occurrence of carbapenemase-producing bacteria in the food chain and other animal sources in order to assist in the formulation of measures  to prevent their potential spread.

TI  == epidemiology and antibiotic resistance in a large italian teaching hospital.
AB  == we focused our attention on susceptibility profile of acinetobacter spp., pseudomonas spp., and klebsiella spp. isolated from biological specimens at the university hospital of salerno between june 2011 and october 2012. acinetobacter, with a prevalence of acinetobacter baumannii (97%) presented a high range of resistance to the antimicrobials considered, excluding colistin (col). klebsiella spp. isolates, with a prevalence of klebsiella pneumoniae (90%), presented a variable pattern of resistance [from 9.8% for col to 50% for levofloxacin (lev)]. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases production was detected in 15% of isolates. most pseudomonas isolates were p. aeruginosa with a high rate of resistance (95%  to amoxicillin/clavulanate and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and <50% to the other antibiotics). colistin remained the most effective drug tested. this study  provided useful information of the local bacterial epidemiology hopefully permitting to establish a more effective empirical therapy, preventing the inappropriate use of antibacterial agents and possibly limiting the diffusion of  antibacterial resistance.

TI  == travel-related carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria in alberta, canada: the first 3 years.
AB  == we describe here the characteristics of alberta, canada, patients with infections or colonizations with carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria during 2010  to 2013 that were linked to recent travel outside canada. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution, and isolates were characterized using pcr, sequencing, and multilocus sequencing typing. a broth mating study was used to assess the transferability of resistance plasmids, which were subsequently characterized. all the patients (n=12) included in our study had contact with a health care system while abroad. most of the patients presented with urinary tract infections (utis) and were admitted to hospitals within weeks after their return to alberta. secondary spread occurred in 1 case,  resulting in the death of another patient. the carbapenemase-producing bacteria (n=17) consisted of escherichia coli (sequence type 101 [st101], st365, st405, and st410) with ndm-1, klebsiella pneumoniae (st15, st16, st147, st258, st340, st512, and st972) with ndm-1, oxa-181, kpc-2, and kpc-3, acinetobacter baumannii  with oxa-23, providencia rettgeri with ndm-1, enterobacter cloacae with kpc-2, and citrobacter freundii with ndm-1. the blandm-1 gene was associated with various narrow- (i.e., incf) and broad- (i.e., inca/c and incl/m) host-range plasmids with different addiction factors. our results show that ndm-producing k. pneumoniae, belonging to a variety of sequence types with different plasmid scaffolds, are regularly imported from india into alberta. clinical microbiology  laboratories should remain vigilant in detecting bacteria with carbapenemases.

TI  == contamination of medical charts: an important source of potential infection in hospitals.
AB  == objective: this prospective study aims to identify and compare the incidence of bacterial contamination of hospital charts and the distribution of species responsible for chart contamination in different units of a tertiary hospital. methods: all beds in medical, surgical, pediatric, and obstetric-gynecologic general wards (556) and those in corresponding special units (125) including medical, surgical, pediatric intensive care units (icus), the obstetric tocolytic unit and delivery room were surveyed for possible chart contamination. the outer  surfaces of included charts were sampled by one experienced investigator with sterile cotton swabs rinsed with normal saline. results: for general wards and special units, the overall sampling rates were 81.8% (455/556) and 85.6% (107/125) (p = 0.316); the incidence of chart contamination was 63.5% and 83.2%,  respectively (p<0.001). except for obstetric-gynecologic charts, the incidence was significantly higher in each and in all icus than in corresponding wards. coagulase-negative staphylococci was the most common contaminant in general wards (40.0%) and special units (34.6%) (p>0.05). special units had a significantly higher incidence of bacterial contamination due to staphylococcus aureus (17.8%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (9.3%), streptococcus viridans (9.4%), escherichia coli (11.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%), and acinetobacter baumannii (7.5%). logistic regression analysis revealed the incidence of chart contamination was 2- to 4-fold higher in special units than in general wards [odds ratios: 1.97-4.00]. conclusions: noting that most hospital charts are contaminated, our study confirms that a hospital chart is not only a medical record but also an important source of potential infection. the plastic cover of  the medical chart can harbor potential pathogens, thus acting as a vector of bacteria. additionally, chart contamination is more common in icus. these findings highlight the importance of effective hand-washing before and after handling medical charts. however, managers and clinical staff should pay more attention to the issue and may consider some interventions.

TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == antibiofilm and antimicrobial efficacy of dispersinb(r)-ksl-w peptide-based wound gel against chronic wound infection associated bacteria.
AB  == the medical importance of bacterial biofilms has increased with the recognition of biofilms as one of the major contributors to the slow or non-healing chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. being a protected community of microorganisms, biofilms are notoriously refractory to antibiotic treatments. as the conventional treatment modalities have proven ineffective, this study provides the in vitro evidence to support the use of a novel combination of dispersinb((r)) antibiofilm enzyme that inhibits biofilm formation and disperses preformed biofilm, and thus making the biofilm bacteria more susceptible to a broad-spectrum ksl-w antimicrobial peptide. the combination of dispersinb((r)) and ksl-w peptide showed synergistic antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against chronic wound infection associated biofilm-embedded bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), and  acinetobacter baumannii. in addition, the wound gel formulation comprising dispersinb((r)), ksl-w peptide, and a gelling agent pluronic f-127 showed a broad-spectrum and enduring antimicrobial activity against test organisms. furthermore, as compared to commercial wound gel silver-sept, dispersinb((r))-ksl-w peptide-based wound gel was significantly more effective in inhibiting the biofilm-embedded mrsa, s. epidermidis, cons, vancomycin-resistant  enterococci, a. baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < 0.05). thus, this study provides promising evidence for the potential application of antibiofilm-antimicrobial dispersinb((r))-ksl-w wound gel in chronic wound management.

AB  == polymyxin b (pmb) and colistin, administered as the prodrug colistin methanesulfonate sodium (cms), are increasingly used to treat carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria. nephrotoxicity is the major dose-limiting adverse effect of both polymyxins. a retrospective cohort study of  132 patients was conducted to evaluate risk factors for acute kidney injury (aki), classified according to acute kidney injury network criteria, in patients  treated with >/=48h of intravenous pmb or cms, with particular focus on potential differences between each polymyxin. the overall incidence of aki was 25.8% (34/132) [20.8% (20/96) and 38.9% (14/36) in patients treated with pmb and cms, respectively; p=0.06]. in the cox regression model, doses >/=2million international units (miu) of pmb or >9miu of cms were the only variable independently associated with aki [adjusted hazard ratio (ahr)=2.11, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.01-4.41; p=0.04]. vancomycin co-administration was strongly associated with aki, although this was not statistically significant (ahr=2.22, 95% ci 0.98-5.04; p=0.058). there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of aki between patients treated with pmb or cms in the multivariate model (ahr=1.74, 95% ci 0.82-3.69; p=0.15). high dose was the main risk factor for aki regardless of the polymyxin administered. vancomycin co-administration likely increases the risk of aki. although there was a higher overall incidence of aki in patients treated with cms compared with pmb, cms was  not significantly associated with this outcome after adjusting for the above variables.

AB  == skin secretions from frogs belonging to the genera xenopus, silurana, hymenochirus, and pseudhymenochirus in the family pipidae are a rich source of host-defense peptides with varying degrees of antimicrobial activities and cytotoxicities to mammalian cells. magainin, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (pgla), caerulein-precursor fragment (cpf), and xenopsin-precursor fragment (xpf) peptides have been isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from several species of xenopus and silurana. hymenochirins and pseudhymenochirins have been isolated from hymenochirus boettgeri and pseudhymenochirus merlini. a major obstacle to the development of these peptides as anti-infective agents is their hemolytic activities against human erythrocytes. analogs of the magainins,  cpf peptides and hymenochirin-1b with increased antimicrobial potencies and low cytotoxicities have been developed that are active (mic < 5 mum) against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and klebsiella pneumoniae.  despite this, the therapeutic potential of frog skin peptides as anti-infective agents has not been realized so that alternative clinical applications as anti-cancer, anti-viral, anti-diabetic, or immunomodulatory drugs are being explored.

TI  == epidemiology and clinical features of post-transplant bloodstream infection: an analysis of 222 consecutive liver transplant recipients.
AB  == background: bloodstream infection (bsi) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in liver transplant (lt) recipients. this study aimed to investigate the epidemiology and clinical features of post-transplant bsi in lt recipients. materials and methods: the microbiology, frequency, and outcome of post-transplant bsi in the first year after lt were retrospectively analyzed in 222 consecutive patients who had received liver transplants at a single center between 2005 and 2011. the risk factors for post-transplant bsi and death were evaluated. results: during a 1-year period after lt, 112 episodes of bsi occurred in 64 of the 222 patients (28.8%). a total of 135 microorganisms were isolated from 112 bsi episodes including 18 polymicrobial episodes. the median time to bsi onset ranged from 8 days for klebsiella pneumoniae to 101 days for enterococci, and the overall median for all microorganisms was 28 days. the most frequent pathogens were enterobacteriaceae members (32.5%), enterococci (17.8%), yeasts (14.0%), staphylococcus aureus (10.3%), and acinetobacter baumannii (10.3%); most of them showed resistance to major antibiotics. the major sources of bsi were biliary tract (36.2%), abdominal and/or wound (28.1%), and intravascular catheter (18.5%) infections. the independent risk factors for post-transplant bsi were biliary complications (odds ratio [or]: 2.91, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 1.29  to 6.59, p = 0.010) and longer hospitalization in the intensive care unit (or: 1.04, 95% ci: 1.00 to 1.08, p < 0.001) after lt. bsi was an independent risk factor for death (hazard ratio [hr]: 3.92, 95% ci: 2.22 to 6.91, p < 0.001), with a poorer survival rate observed in patients with bsi than in those without bsi (1-year survival rate: 60.0% versus 89.5%, respectively, p < 0.001) after lt. the strongest predictors for death in patients with bsi were hepatocellular carcinoma (hr: 3.82, 95% ci: 1.57 to 9.32, p = 0.003), candidemia (hr: 3.71, 95% ci: 1.58 to 8.71, p = 0.003), polymicrobial bacteremia (hr: 3.18, 95% ci: 1.39 to 7.28, p  = 0.006), and post-transplant hemodialysis (hr: 2.44, 95% ci: 1.02 to 5.84, p = 0.044). conclusions: bsi was a frequent post-transplant complication, and most of the causative pathogens were multi-drug resistant. biliary complications and bsis resulting from biliary infection are major problems for lt recipients. the prevention of bsi and biliary complications is critical in improving prognosis in liver transplant recipients.

TI  == could chloramphenicol be used against eskape pathogens? a review of in vitro data in the literature from the 21st century.
AB  == the widespread use of antibiotics has been associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria. 'eskape' (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acintobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century. chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. however, it is still widely used in the developing world. in light of the emerging problem of multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. our paper reviews  in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against eskape pathogens. susceptibility patterns for gram-positives were good, although less favorable for gram-negatives. however, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found  to have synergistic activity. the risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol toxicity has not been analyzed. therefore, extra precautions should be taken when prescribing this agent.

TI  == the growing resistance of klebsiella pneumoniae; the need to expand our antibiogram: case report and review of the literature.
AB  == carbapenemases are being increasingly reported in enterobacteriaceae including klebsiella pneumoniae causing considerable increases in morbidity and mortality with limited therapeutic options. issues related to difficulties associated with  pathogen identification and infection control have been identified as major obstacles to the control of these multi-drug resistant organisms. identification  of this enzyme in organisms not previously found to harbor them has added to the  already existing challenge in the control of this growing problem. the case of a  60 year-old saudi lady with diabetes, hypertension, pituitary adenoma, hypothyroidism, and obstructive sleep apnea who was admitted in our intensive care unit following a cardiac arrest is hereby presented. during the course of her treatment she acquired various infections that led to her exposure to antimicrobials from almost all classes at various times; including bacteremia due to a pan-drug resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and multi-drug resistant acinetobacter baumannii. she was successfully treated with a combination of colistin and amikacin. this case highlights the resurgence of colistin in clinical practice and also calls for the need to expand our antibiogram to include antibiotics not conventionally reported, especially in areas where drug resistance is a growing problem. improving susceptibility detection methods for klebsiella pneumoniae and hand hygiene could prove effective in reducing nosocomial infections. involvement of clinical pharmacists in antimicrobial stewardship could reduce the development of antimicrobial drug resistance.

TI  == [monitoring and antibiotic resistance profile of tracheal aspirate microbiota in  icu children with severe craniocerebral trauma].
AB  == nosocomial infections and their rational antibiotic treatment represent a major challenge for the healthcare nowadays. in this context, gramnegative bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii and enterobacteriaceae spp. are etiologically important and characterized by a significant level of antibiotic resistance. to examine dynamics of the respiratory tract colonization  by hospital flora, tracheal aspirates obtained at three time points from 69 children with severe craniocerebral trauma during their stay in icu were analysed. colonization was observed on the 4th day of the icu stay with predomination of k. pneumoniae (45%) and a. baumanii (27-37%). p. aeruginosa was  detected after the 8th day of the icu stay with the isolation rate of 33%. substantial proportions of p. aeruginosa (61%), a. baumanii (78%) and k. pneumoniae (25%) were resistant to carbapenems. in 65 carbapemen resistant isolates, the presence of carbapenemases was examined using pcrs. oxa-48 carbapenemase was detected in 11 out of 14 (78%) k. pneumoniae isolates. among the a. baumanii isolates, 30/31 (97%) carried oxa-40 and 1/31 (3%) had oxa-23 carbapenemases. none of the examined a. baumanii and k. pneumoniae isolates produced metallo-betalactamases (mbl). in contrast, all 20 carbapenem resistant p. aeruginosa isolates produced a mbl, and in 12 out of 20 (60%) of theme vim-2 was detected. thus, gramnegative nosocomial microflora rapidly colonizes icu patients and has a high level of resistance to antibiotics, including carbapenems.

TI  == health care workers' hand contamination levels and antibacterial efficacy of different hand hygiene methods used in a vietnamese hospital.
AB  == background: handwashing with soap or another antisepsis disinfectant solution is  a common practice in vietnam, but the availability and quality of tap water is unpredictable. we assessed the risk for hand contamination and compared the efficacy of 5 hand hygiene methods in a tertiary vietnamese hospital. methods: five fingertip imprints of the dominant hand of 134 health care workers (hcws) were sampled to establish the average bacterial count before and after hand hygiene action using (1) alcohol-based handrub (abhr), (2) plain soap and water handwashing with filtered and unfiltered water, or (3) 4% chlorhexidine gluconate hand antisepsis with filtered and unfiltered water. results: average bacterial contamination of hands before hand hygiene was 1.65 log(10). acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus were the most commonly isolated bacterial pathogens. the highest average count before hand hygiene was recovered from hcws without direct patient contact (2.10 +/- 0.11 log(10)). bacterial counts were markedly reduced after hand hygiene with abhr (1.4 log(10); p < .0001) and 4% chlorhexidine gluconate with filtered water (0.8  log(10); p < .0001). use of unfiltered water was associated with minimal nonsignificant bacterial reduction. conclusions: hcws carry high levels of bacteria on their dominant hand, even without direct patient contact. abhr as an  additional step may overcome the effect of high bacterial counts in unfiltered water when soap and water handwashing is indicated.

TI  == analysis of some common pathogens and their drug resistance to antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to investigate the common bacterial resistance of clinical isolates in our hospital in the second half of 2011. methodology: pathogens isolated from clinical samples in the second half of 2011 were analyzed and categorized to perform susceptibility tests. results: in the gram-negative bacteria, enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli accounted for 55.89%  and 34.51%. in the gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus, strptococcus pneumonia accounted  for 32.85%, 40.39%, 12.41% and 10.22%, respectively. other species accounted for  4.14%. klebsiella pneumonia and pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to cepoperazon, cefepime and imipenem. however,acinetobacter baumannii was more sensitive to carbapenems antibiotics, which was followed by fourth generation cephalosporins. klebsiella pneumoniae was extremely sensitive to amikacin, cefepime and imipenem, but was resistant to ampicillin. the detection rates of the broad-spectrum escherichia coli, pseudomonasaeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae were 54.51%, 52.08% and 38.65%. the gram negative bacilli were the prevalent clinical pathogens in our hospital in the second half of 2011. conclusion: the drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria has increased significantly recently, thus the surveillance of antibacterial agents is necessary, and rational use of antibiotic will be urgently needed to reduce the production and dissemination of drug resistant strains.

TI  == validation of a novel murine wound model of acinetobacter baumannii infection.
AB  == patients recovering from traumatic injuries or surgery often require weeks to months of hospitalization, increasing the risk for wound and surgical site infections caused by eskape pathogens, which include a. baumannii (the eskape pathogens are enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species). as new therapies are being developed to counter a. baumannii infections, animal models are also needed to evaluate potential treatments. here, we present an excisional, murine wound model in which a diminutive inoculum of a clinically relevant, multidrug-resistant a. baumannii isolate can proliferate, form biofilms, and be effectively treated with antibiotics. the model requires a temporary, cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia to establish an infection that can persist. a 6-mm-diameter, full-thickness wound was created in the skin overlying the thoracic spine, and after the wound bed was inoculated, it was covered with a dressing for 7 days. uninoculated control wounds healed within 13  days, whereas infected, placebo-treated wounds remained unclosed beyond 21 days.  treated and untreated wounds were assessed with multiple quantitative and qualitative techniques that included gross pathology, weight loss and recovery, wound closure, bacterial burden, 16s rrna community profiling, histopathology, peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence in situ hybridization, and scanning electron microscopy assessment of biofilms. the range of differences that we are able to identify with these measures in antibiotic- versus placebo-treated animals provides a clear window within which novel antimicrobial therapies can be assessed. the model can be used to evaluate antimicrobials for their ability to reduce specific pathogen loads in wounded tissues and clear biofilms. ultimately, the mouse model approach allows for highly powered studies and serves as an initial multifaceted in vivo assessment prior to testing in larger animals.

TI  == an analog of the host-defense peptide hymenochirin-1b with potent broad-spectrum  activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria and immunomodulatory properties.
AB  == hymenochirin-1b (iklspetkdn(10)lkkvlkgaik(20)gaiavakmv.nh2) is a cationic, amphipathic, alpha-helical, host-defense peptide, first isolated from skin secretions of the congo clawed frog hymenochirus boettgeri (pipidae). structure-activity relationships were investigated by synthesizing analogs in which the pro(5), glu(6) and asp(9) on the hydrophilic face of the alpha-helix are substituted by one or more l-lysine or d-lysine residues. although replacement with l-lysine generates analogs with increased antimicrobial potency  against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (up to 8-fold), the peptides are more hemolytic. increasing the cationicity of hymenochirin-1b while  reducing the helicity by substitutions with d-lysine generates analogs that are between 2 and 8 fold more potent than the native peptide and are equally or less  hemolytic. [e6k,d9k]hymenochirin-1b represents a candidate for drug development as it shows high potency against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and a range of gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains of acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic in the range 0.8-3.1 mum) and ndm-1 carbapenemase-producing clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii (mic in the range 3.1-6.25 mum), and low hemolytic activity (lc50=302 mum). [e6k,d9k]hymenochirin-1b, at a concentration of 2.5 mum, significantly (p<0.05) stimulates the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines il-4 and il-10 by human peripheral blood mononuclear  cells but is without significant effect on production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-alpha and il-17.

TI  == epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacteremia caused by drug-resistant eskape pathogens in cancer patients.
AB  == purpose: infection due to the six eskape pathogens has recently been identified as a serious emerging problem. however, there is still a lack of information on bacteremia caused by these organisms in cancer patients. we aimed to assess the epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacteremia due to drug-resistant eskape pathogens (reskape) in patients with cancer. methods: all episodes of bacteremia prospectively documented in hospitalized adults with cancer from 2006  to 2011 were analyzed. results: of 1,148 episodes of bacteremia, 392 (34 %) were  caused by eskape pathogens. fifty-four episodes (4.7 %) were due to reskape strains (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium 0, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 13, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (eslb)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae 7, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii 4, carbapenem- and quinolone-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa 18 and derepression chromosomic ss-lactam and esbl-producing enterobacter species 12. risk factors independently associated with reskape bacteremia were comorbidities, prior antibiotic therapy, urinary catheter and urinary tract source. inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was more frequent in patients with reskape bacteremia than in the other cases (55.6 % vs. 21.5 %, p < 0.001). persistence of bacteremia (25 % vs. 9.7 %), septic metastasis (8 % vs. 4 %) and early case-fatality rate (23 % vs. 11 %) were more frequent in patients with reskape bacteremia than in patients with other etiologies (p < 0.05). conclusions: bacteremia due to reskape pathogens in cancer patients occurs mainly among those with comorbidities who have received prior antibiotic therapy and have a urinary tract source. these patients often receive inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy and have a poor outcome.

AB  == resistant gram-negative bacteria are increasing central-line-associated bloodstream infection threats. to better combat this, chlorhexidine (chx) was added to minocycline-rifampin (m/r) catheters. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of chx-m/r catheters against multidrug resistant, gram-negative acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia was tested.  m/r and chx-silver sulfadiazine (chx/ss) catheters were used as comparators. the  novel chx-m/r catheters were significantly more effective (p < 0.0001) than chx/ss or m/r catheters in preventing biofilm colonization and showed better antimicrobial durability.

TI  == small molecule downregulation of pmrab reverses lipid a modification and breaks colistin resistance.
AB  == infections caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria, particularly gram-negative bacteria, are an ever-increasing problem. while the development of new antibiotics remains one option in the fight against bacteria that have become resistant to currently available antibiotics, an attractive alternative is the development of adjuvant therapeutics that restore the efficacy of existing antibiotics. we report a small molecule adjuvant that suppresses colistin resistance in multidrug resistant acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae by interfering with the expression of a two-component system. the compound downregulates the pmrcab operon and reverses phosphoethanolamine modification of lipid a responsible for colistin resistance. furthermore, colistin-susceptible and colistin-resistant bacteria do not evolve resistance to  combination treatment. this represents the first definitive example of a compound that breaks antibiotic resistance by directly modulating two-component system activity.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and sar study of new gemini imidazolium-based chlorides.
AB  == a series of 70 new 3,3'(alpha,omega-dioxaalkyl)bis(1-alkylimidazolium) chlorides  were synthesized. they were characterized with respect to surface active properties and antimicrobial activity against the following pathogens: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida krusei, and candida albicans. in this article, besides description of the synthesis, we characterize a set of features of these compounds, concerning their structure (described by the length of the dioxaalkan  spacer and the length of the alkyl substituent in the aromatic ring) and surface  active properties (critical micelle concentration, value of surface tension at critical micelle concentration, value of surface excess, molecular area of a single particle, and free energy of adsorption of molecule). then, we present a sar study for staphylococcus aureus, as one of the most widespread pathogenic strains, conducted with the help of the dominance-based rough set approach (drsa), that involves identification of relevant features and relevant combinations of features being in strong relationship with a high antimicrobial activity of the compounds. the sar study shows, moreover, that the antimicrobial  activity is dependent on the type of substituents and their position at the chloride moiety, as well as on the surface active properties of the compounds.

TI  == activity of the colistin-rifampicin combination against colistin-resistant, carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == colistin (col) is one of the few antimicrobials that retain activity against carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria (gnb). however, the emergence of col resistance has renewed the use of combination therapy. the aim of this study  was to determine the activity of col plus rifampicin (rif) against clinical isolates of col-resistant, carbapenemase-producing gnb. we employed 36 col-resistant carbapenemase-producing isolates (27 klebsiella pneumoniae, 5 serratia marcescens, and 4 acinetobacter baumannii) belonging to 36 patients. e-test/agar dilution of all strains was performed with e-test strips of col placed on agar plates with and without rif. in 11 patients, the synergy was confirmed by time-kill studies. synergy was detected in 34 isolates, whereas indifference was detected in two s. marcescens. the e-test/agar dilution method showed comparable results to the time-kill studies. seven patients infected with  these isolates (two meningitis, four sepsis, and one urinary tract infection) were treated with the combination successfully.

TI  == colistin: re-emergence of the 'forgotten' antimicrobial agent.
AB  == the treatment of the emerging multidrug resistant (mdr) gram-negative organisms is a challenge. the development of newer antibiotics has recently slowed down. this has led to the re-emergence of the 'old forgotten' antibiotic "colistin", whose use had almost stopped (after 1970's) due to the high incidence of nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. colistin (polymyxin e) is a polypeptide antibiotic belonging to polymyxin group of antibiotics with activity mainly against the gram-negative organisms. use of colistin has been increasing in the recent past and newer studies have shown lesser toxicity and good efficacy. colistin acts on the bacterial cell membrane resulting in increased cell permeability and cell lysis. colistin can be administered orally, topically, by inhalational route, intramuscularly, intrathecally, and also intravenously. parenteral colistin (in the form of colistimethate sodium) has been used to treat ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) and bacteremia caused by mdr bacteria such  as pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and acinetobacter baumannii. inhaled colistin is used for treating pneumonia/vap due to mdr gram-negative organisms and also used prophylactically in patients with cystic fibrosis. this manuscript is a brief review of colistin and its clinical applications in the pediatric population.

TI  == active surveillance for asymptomatic colonization with multidrug-resistant gram negative bacilli among injured service members--a three year evaluation.
AB  == in response to the high rates of colonization and infection by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (mdr gnb), many military treatment facilities (mtfs) have implemented additional infection control practices, such as active surveillance cultures for asymptomatic colonization. results of surveillance cultures (june 2009 - may 2012) collected from patients at landstuhl regional medical center (landstuhl rmc), germany, and three u.s. mtfs were analyzed to evaluate trends in mdr gnb colonization over time and across facilities. at landstuhl rmc, 6.6 percent of patients were colonized on admission with mdr gnb compared to 12.4 percent of patients admitted to the participating u.s. mtfs. escherichia coli was the predominant organism, representing 82.4 percent of mdr isolates at landstuhl rmc and 67.1 to 83.3 percent at u.s. mtfs. other common mdr gnb included acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex and klebsiella pneumoniae. although pseudomonas aeruginosa was often isolated from the surveillance cultures, it was never multidrug-resistant. annual rates of mdr  gnb colonization were not significantly different over the three-year period. ongoing research includes assessment of predictive factors for mdr gnb colonization and the relationship between colonization and infection.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured cu-sio2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
AB  == there is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (hcai). one method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial  materials. the antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in hcai. the structure of the coatings was determined using scanning electron microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on bs iso 22196:2007. the coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. sem showed nano-structured aggregates of cu within a silica matrix. a log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. the results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. the coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential  applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.

TI  == lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanocluster-based affinity mass spectrometry for pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == rationale: bacterial infections can be difficult to treat and can lead to irreversible damage to patients if proper treatment is not provided in time. additionally, the emerging threat from antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains makes medical treatment even more difficult. thus, rapid identification of infected bacterial strains is essential to assist diagnostics and medical treatment. methods: lysozymes are glycoside hydrolases that can bind with peptidoglycans on bacterial cell walls. in this work, we demonstrated that lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanoclusters (lysozyme-auncs) with red photoluminescence can be used as affinity probes to concentrate pathogenic bacteria. after bacteria had been probed by the lysozyme-auncs in a sample solution, the lysozyme-aunc-bacteria conjugates were readily spun down at a low centrifugation speed. the red emission from the auncs on the conjugates could be  visualized with the naked eye under illumination of ultraviolet light. the bacteria in the conjugates can be identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (maldi-ms) combined with principal component analysis (pca). results: we demonstrated that pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre) can be readily concentrated by the lysozyme-auncs and distinguished by the results combining maldi-ms and pca. additionally, the possibility of using the current approach to  differentiate e. faecalis from vre was also demonstrated. the lowest detection concentration for e. coli using the current approach is ~10(6) cells/ml. conclusions: the results indicated that the lysozyme-auncs are effective affinity probes for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. by combining the results from maldi-ms and pca, different bacteria can be easily distinguished. the current approach can be potentially used to assist the identification of bacteria from biological fluids.

TI  == effect of aerosolized colistin as adjunctive treatment on the outcomes of microbiologically documented ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by colistin-only susceptible gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background: the increasing frequency of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) caused by colistin-only susceptible (cos) gram-negative bacteria (gnb) is of great concern. adjunctive aerosolized (as) colistin can reportedly increase alveolar levels of the drug without increasing systemic toxicity. good clinical results have been obtained in patients with cystic fibrosis, but conflicting data have been reported in patients with vap. methods: we conducted a retrospective, 1:1 matched case-control study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of as plus iv  colistin vs iv colistin alone in 208 patients in the icu with vap caused by cos acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or klebsiella pneumoniae. results: compared with the iv colistin cohort, the as-iv colistin cohort had a higher clinical cure rate (69.2% vs 54.8%, p = .03) and required fewer days of mechanical ventilation after vap onset (8 days vs 12 days, p = .001). in the 166  patients with posttreatment cultures, eradication of the causative organism was also more common in the as-iv colistin group (63.4% vs 50%, p = .08). no between-cohort differences were observed in all-cause icu mortality, length of icu stay after vap onset, or rates of acute kidney injury (aki) during colistin therapy. independent predictors of clinical cure were trauma-related icu admission (p = .01) and combined as-iv colistin therapy (p = .009). higher mean simplified acute physiology score ii (p = .002) and sequential organ failure assessment (p = .05) scores, septic shock (p &lt; .001), and aki onset during colistin treatment (p = .04) were independently associated with clinical failure. conclusions: our results suggest that as colistin might be a beneficial adjunct to iv colistin in the management of vap caused by cos gnb.

TI  == toward repurposing ciclopirox as an antibiotic against drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant infections caused by gram-negative bacteria are a major healthcare concern. repurposing drugs circumvents the time and money limitations  associated with developing new antimicrobial agents needed to combat these antibiotic-resistant infections. here we identified the off-patent antifungal agent, ciclopirox, as a candidate to repurpose for antibiotic use. to test the efficacy of ciclopirox against antibiotic-resistant pathogens, we used a curated  collection of acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates that are representative of known antibiotic resistance phenotypes. we found that ciclopirox, at 5-15 microg/ml concentrations, inhibited bacterial growth regardless of the antibiotic resistance status. at these same concentrations, ciclopirox reduced growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates, but some of these pathogens required higher ciclopirox concentrations to completely block growth. to determine how ciclopirox inhibits bacterial growth, we performed an overexpression screen in e. coli. this screen revealed that gale, which encodes udp-glucose 4-epimerase, rescued bacterial growth at otherwise restrictive ciclopirox concentrations. we found that ciclopirox does not inhibit epimerization of udp-galactose by purified e. coli gale; however, deltagalu, deltagale, deltarfai, or deltarfab mutant strains all have lower ciclopirox minimum inhibitory concentrations than the parent strain. the galu, gale, rfai, and rfab genes all encode enzymes that use udp-galactose or udp-glucose for galactose metabolism and lipopolysaccharide (lps) biosynthesis. indeed, we found that ciclopirox altered lps composition of an e. coli clinical isolate. taken together, our data demonstrate that ciclopirox affects galactose metabolism and lps biosynthesis, two pathways important for bacterial growth and virulence. the lack of any reported fungal resistance to ciclopirox in over twenty years of use in the clinic, its excellent safety profiles, novel target(s), and efficacy, make ciclopirox a promising potential antimicrobial agent to use against multidrug-resistant problematic gram-negative  pathogens.

TI  == molecular characterization of multidrug resistant hospital isolates using the antimicrobial resistance determinant microarray.
AB  == molecular methods that enable the detection of antimicrobial resistance determinants are critical surveillance tools that are necessary to aid in curbing the spread of antibiotic resistance. in this study, we describe the use of the antimicrobial resistance determinant microarray (ardm) that targets 239 unique genes that confer resistance to 12 classes of antimicrobial compounds, quaternary amines and streptothricin for the determination of multidrug resistance (mdr) gene profiles. fourteen reference mdr strains, which either were genome, sequenced or possessed well characterized drug resistance profiles were used to optimize detection algorithms and threshold criteria to ensure the microarray's effectiveness for unbiased characterization of antimicrobial resistance determinants in mdr strains. the subsequent testing of acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae hospital isolates revealed the presence of several antibiotic resistance genes [e.g. belonging to tem, shv, oxa  and ctx-m classes (and oxa and ctx-m subfamilies) of beta-lactamases] and their assemblages which were confirmed by pcr and dna sequence analysis. when combined  with results from the reference strains, ~25% of the ardm content was confirmed as effective for representing allelic content from both gram-positive and -negative species. taken together, the ardm identified mdr assemblages containing six to 18 unique resistance genes in each strain tested, demonstrating its utility as a powerful tool for molecular epidemiological investigations of antimicrobial resistance in clinically relevant bacterial pathogens.

TI  == systematic review and meta-analysis of in vitro synergy of polymyxins and carbapenems.
AB  == our objective was to examine the evidence of in vitro synergy of polymyxin-carbapenem combination therapy against gram-negative bacteria (gnb). a  systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. all studies examining in vitro interactions of antibiotic combinations consisting of any carbapenem with colistin or polymyxin b against any gnb were used. a broad search was conducted with no language, date, or publication status restrictions. synergy rates, defined as a fractional inhibitory concentration index of </=0.5 or a >2-log reduction in cfu, were pooled separately for time-kill, checkerboard, and etest methods in a mixed-effect meta-analysis of rates. we examined whether the synergy rate depended on the testing method, type of antibiotic, bacteria, and resistance to carbapenems. pooled rates with 95% confidence intervals (ci) are shown. thirty-nine published studies and 15 conference proceeding were included, reporting on 246 different tests on 1,054 bacterial isolates. in time-kill studies, combination therapy showed synergy rates of 77% (95% ci, 64 to 87%) for  acinetobacter baumannii, 44% (95% ci, 30 to 59%) for klebsiella pneumoniae, and 50% (95% ci, 30 to 69%) for pseudomonas aeruginosa, with low antagonism rates for all. doripenem showed high synergy rates for all three bacteria. for a. baumannii, meropenem was more synergistic than imipenem, whereas for p. aeruginosa the opposite was true. checkerboard and etest studies generally reported lower synergy rates than time-kill studies. the use of combination therapy led to less resistance development in vitro. the combination of a carbapenem with a polymyxin against gnb, especially a. baumannii, is supported in vitro by high synergy rates, with low antagonism and less resistance development. these findings should be examined in clinical studies.

TI  == risk factors and outcomes of bacteremia caused by drug-resistant eskape pathogens in solid-organ transplant recipients.
AB  == background: although infections due to the six eskape pathogens have recently been identified as a serious emerging problem, information regarding bacteremia caused by these organisms in solid-organ transplant (sot) recipients is lacking.  we sought to determine the frequency, risk factors, and outcomes of bacteremia due to drug-resistant eskape (reskape) organisms in liver, kidney, and heart adult transplant recipients. methods: all episodes of bacteremia prospectively documented in hospitalized sot recipients from 2007 to 2012 were analyzed. results: of 276 episodes of bacteremia, 54 (19.6%) were due to reskape strains (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium [0], methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [5], extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella  pneumoniae [10], carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii [8], carbapenem- and quinolone-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa [26], and derepressed chromosomal  beta-lactam and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacter species [5]). factors independently associated with reskape bacteremia were prior transplantation, septic shock, and prior antibiotic therapy. patients with reskape bacteremia more often received inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy than the others (41% vs. 21.6%; p=0.01). overall case-fatality rate (30 days) was higher in patients with reskape bacteremia (35.2% vs. 14.4%; p=0.001). conclusions: bacteremia due to reskape pathogens is frequent in sot recipients and causes significant morbidity and mortality. reskape organisms should be considered when selecting empirical antibiotic therapy for hospitalized sot recipients presenting with septic shock, particularly those with prior transplantation and antibiotic use.

TI  == serum and urine pharmacokinetics of tigecycline in obese class iii and normal weight adults.
AB  == objectives: to compare the serum and urine pharmacokinetics (pk) of intravenous tigecycline in obese class iii (obese-c3) adults with those in normal weight (nw) adults. patients and methods: obese-c3 (n = 8) and nw (n = 4) healthy adult volunteers received a single intravenous dose of 100 mg of tigecycline for 30 min. serum (0-96 h) and urine (0-48 h) tigecycline concentrations were assayed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. parametric population pk systems analyses were used to model the data and assess the effects of total body weight (tbw) on pk parameters. the area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (auc0-infinity) was simulated to estimate the probability of auc0-infinity : mic target attainment and cumulative fraction of response (cfr) based on wild-type mic distributions of select pathogens. clinicaltrials.gov: nct01560143. results: the median (range) age, tbw and initial body mass index were 42 (20-50) years, 121 (61-160) kg and 43.8 (20.8-53.8) kg/m(2), respectively. the serum concentration-time profiles and exposures were similar in the obese-c3 and nw adults, with a mean urine recovery of 15.8% and 13.4%, respectively. the median (range) auc0-infinity was 8.19 (6.12, 11.2) and 7.50 (6.78, 9.13) mg . h/l in the obese-c3 and nw groups, respectively. the clearance of tigecycline was not related to tbw. the cfr was calculated to be <90% against acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae for an auc0-infinity : mic target >/= 6.96. conclusions: the serum and urine pk of tigecycline is similar in obese-c3 and nw healthy adults. a lower cfr is predicted against certain gram-negative pathogens with the current standard tigecycline dosing regimen, irrespective of tbw.

TI  == current status of carbapenemases in latin america.
AB  == enterobacteriaceae and non fermenting gram-negative bacilli have become a threat  to public health, in part due to their resistance to multiple antibiotic classes, which ultimately have led to an increase in morbidity and mortality. beta-lactams are currently the mainstay for combating infections caused by these microorganisms, and beta-lactamases are the major mechanism of resistance to this class of antibiotics. within the beta-lactamases, carbapenemases pose one of the  gravest threats, as they compromise one of our most potent lines of defense, the  carbapenems. carbapenemases are being continuously identified worldwide; and in latin america, numerous members of these enzymes have been reported. in this region, the high incidence of reports implies that carbapenemases have become a menace and that they are an issue that must be carefully studied and analyzed.

TI  == evaluation of anti-resistant activity of auklandia (saussurea lappa) root against some human pathogens.
AB  == objective: the antimicrobial activity of the ethanol extract of the auklandia (saussurea lappa)root plant was investigated to verify its medicinal use in the treatment of microbial infections. methods: the antimicrobial activity of the ethanol extract was tested against clinical isolates of some multidrug-resistant  bacteria using the agar well diffusion method. commercial antibiotics were used as positive reference standards to determine the sensitivity of the clinical isolates. results: the extracts showed significant inhibitory activity against clinical isolates of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, extended spectrum beta-lactemase, acinetobacter baumannii. the minimum inhibitory concentration values obtained using the agar dilution test ranged from 2.0 microg/microl-12.0 microg/microl. in the contrary the water extract showed no activity at all against the tested isolates. furthermore, the results obtained by examining anti-resistant activity of the plant ethanolic extract showed that at higher concentration of the plant extract (12 microg) all tested bacteria isolates were  inhibited with variable inhibition zones similar to those obtained when we applied lower extract concentration using the well diffusion assay. conclusion: the results demonstrated that the crude ethanolic extract of the auklandia (saussurea lappa) root plant has a wide spectrum of activity suggesting that it may be useful in the treatment of infections caused by the above clinical isolates (human pathogens).

TI  == purification and characterization of biofilm-associated eps exopolysaccharides from eskape organisms and other pathogens.
AB  == in bacterial biofilms, high molecular weight, secreted exopolysaccharides can serve as a scaffold to which additional carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids adhere, forming the matrix of the developing biofilm. here we report methods to extract and purify high molecular weight (>15 kda) exopolysaccharides from biofilms of eight human pathogens, including species of staphylcococcus, klebsiella, acinetobacter, pseudomonas, and a toxigenic strain of escherichia coli o157:h7. glycosyl composition analysis indicated a high total mannose content across all strains with p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii exopolysaccharides comprised of 80-90% mannose, k. pneumoniae and s. epidermidis  strains containing 40-50% mannose, and e. coli with approximately 10% mannose. galactose and glucose were also present in all eight strains, usually as the second and third most abundant carbohydrates. n-acetyl-glucosamine and galacturonic acid were found in 6 of 8 strains, while arabinose, fucose, rhamnose, and xylose were found in 5 of 8 strains. for linkage analysis, 33 distinct residue-linkage combinations were detected with the most abundant being  mannose-linked moieties, in line with the composition analysis. the exopolysaccharides of two p. aeruginosa strains analyzed were consistent with the psl carbohydrate, but not pel or alginate. the s. epidermidis strain had a composition rich in mannose and glucose, which is consistent with the previously  described slime associated antigen (saa) and the extracellular slime substance (ess), respectively, but no polysaccharide intracellular adhesion (pia) was detected. the high molecular weight exopolysaccharides from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and a. baumannii appear to be novel, based on composition and/or ratio analysis of carbohydrates.

TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of china.
AB  == background: bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aecopd). therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. so far, data on this topic among chinese are lacking. methods: a surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with aecopd at five areas in china between october 2006 and april 2008. the sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. results: three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with aecopd. the predominant bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and escherichia coli (3.6%). the majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. conclusions: gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with aecopd in china. haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in aecopd. this study provides evidence for local surveillance of aecopd pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in china.

TI  == pharmacology of polymyxins: new insights into an 'old' class of antibiotics.
AB  == increasing antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacteria, particularly in pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae, presents a global medical challenge. no new antibiotics will be available for these 'superbugs' in the near future due to the dry antibiotic discovery pipeline. colistin and polymyxin b are increasingly used as the last-line therapeutic options for treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria. this article surveys the significant progress over the last decade in understanding polymyxin chemistry, mechanisms of antibacterial activity and resistance, structure-activity relationships and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics. in the 'bad bugs, no drugs' era, we must pursue structure-activity relationship-based approaches to develop novel polymyxin-like lipopeptides targeting polymyxin-resistant gram-negative 'superbugs'. before new antibiotics become available, we must optimize the clinical use of polymyxins through the application of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles, thereby minimizing the development of resistance.

TI  == clinical use of colistin induces cross-resistance to host antimicrobials in acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == the alarming rise in antibiotic resistance has led to an increase in patient mortality and health care costs. this problem is compounded by the absence of new antibiotics close to regulatory approval. acinetobacter baumannii is a human pathogen that causes infections primarily in patients in intensive care units (icus) and is highly antibiotic resistant. colistin is one of the last-line antibiotics for treating a. baumannii infections; however, colistin-resistant strains are becoming increasingly common. this cationic antibiotic attacks negatively charged bacterial membranes in a manner similar to that seen with cationic antimicrobials of the innate immune system. we therefore set out to determine if the increasing use of colistin, and emergence of colistin-resistant  strains, is concomitant with the generation of cross-resistance to host cationic  antimicrobials. we found that there is indeed a positive correlation between resistance to colistin and resistance to the host antimicrobials ll-37 and lysozyme among clinical isolates. importantly, isolates obtained before and after treatment of individual patients demonstrated that colistin use correlated with increased resistance to cationic host antimicrobials. these data reveal the overlooked risk of inducing cross-resistance to host antimicrobials when treating patients with colistin as a last-line antibiotic. importance increased use of the cationic antibiotic colistin to treat multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii has led to the development of colistin-resistant strains. here we report that treatment of patients with colistin can induce not only increased resistance to colistin but also resistance to host cationic antimicrobials. this worrisome finding likely represents an example of a broader trend observed in other bacteria against which colistin is used therapeutically such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae. furthermore, these data suggest that the possible future use of an array of cationic antimicrobial peptides in development as therapeutics may have unintended negative consequences, eventually leading to  the generation of hypervirulent strains that are resistant to innate host defenses. the potential for the induction of cross-resistance to innate immune antimicrobials should be considered during the development of new therapeutics.

TI  == nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia in cuban intensive care units: bacterial species and antibiotic resistance.
AB  == introduction: nosocomial pneumonia associated with use of mechanical ventilators  is one of the greatest challenges confronted by intensivists worldwide. the literature associates several bacteria with this type of infection; most common in intensive care units are acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and some of the enterobacteriaceae family. objectives: to identify the causal agents of nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care units of havana's hermanos ameijeiras clinical-surgical teaching hospital in 2011, and to characterize their antibiotic resistance. methods: a cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted using hospital administrative data of quantitative cultures from positive tracheal aspirates for january through december, 2011. records were analyzed from 77 intensive care unit patients who developed nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia. variables examined were age and sex, and pathogens identified from culture of tracheal aspirate and related antibiotic susceptibility. results species most frequently isolated were: acinetobacter baumannii in 53 patients (68.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa in 34 patients (44.2%), other species of pseudomonas in 15 patients (19.5%), and serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli in  12 patients each (15.6%). some patients presented more than one pathogen in concurrent or successive infections. antimicrobial susceptibility testing found high percentages of resistance to antibiotics in all these pathogens. least resistance was found to colistin. conclusions: the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria causing nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia is of concern. colistin is the drug of choice among the antibiotics reviewed, but sensitivity to other antibiotics should be assessed to search for more appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics for treating nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia. our results also suggest the need to strengthen  infection control efforts, particularly in intensive care units, and to reassess  compliance with quality control procedures. multidisciplinary research involving  microbiologists, epidemiologists, internists and intensivists is needed to fully  understand the etiological and resistance patterns observed.

TI  == predatory bacteria: a potential ally against multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacteria have emerged as a serious threat to human and animal health. bdellovibrio spp. and micavibrio spp. are gram-negative bacteria that prey on other gram-negative bacteria. in this study,  the ability of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and micavibrio aeruginosavorus to prey  on mdr gram-negative clinical strains was examined. although the potential use of predatory bacteria to attack mdr pathogens has been suggested, the data supporting these claims is lacking. by conducting predation experiments we have established that predatory bacteria have the capacity to attack clinical strains  of a variety of ss-lactamase-producing, mdr gram-negative bacteria. our observations indicate that predatory bacteria maintained their ability to prey on mdr bacteria regardless of their antimicrobial resistance, hence, might be used as therapeutic agents where other antimicrobial drugs fail.

AB  == bacteria producing new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. this broad-spectrum resistance  limits treatment options for infections caused by ndm-1 producers. ndm-1 was first isolated from an indian patient in sweden; since then, ndm-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including turkey. in this study,  we investigated the presence of ndm-1 by pcr method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in samsun,  turkey. a total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 acinetobacter baumannii, 54 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 pseudomonas putida, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 3 enterobacter aerogenes, 3 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia rettgeri, 2 escherichia coli and 1 citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using vitek-2 compact (biomerieux, france) and bd  phoenix (bd diagnostic systems, md) automated systems. the results of antibiotic  susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the clsi recommendations. in our study, ndm-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by pcr. there was only one case study that reported the presence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates from turkey [poirel l et al. antimicrob agents chemother 2012;56:2784].  our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates is not common in turkey. however, since ndm-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. therefore, continuous surveillance  and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of ndm-1 may enable to identify ndm-1 producing isolates. meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of ndm-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.

TI  == gram-negative bacteria that produce carbapenemases causing death attributed to recent foreign hospitalization.
AB  == overseas travel, as a risk factor for the acquisition of infections due to antimicrobial-resistant organisms, has recently been linked to carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria. multiresistant klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii strains were isolated from a wound of a canadian patient with a recent history of hospitalization in india. this resulted in the initiation of outbreak management that included surveillance cultures. epidemiological and molecular investigations showed that ndm-1-producing k. pneumoniae st16 and oxa-23-producing a. baumannii st10 strains were transmitted to 5 other patients, resulting in the colonization of 4 patients and the death of 1 patient due to septic shock caused by the oxa-23-producing a.  baumannii strain. the high rate of false positivity of the screening cultures resulted in additional workloads and increased costs for infection control and clinical laboratory work. we believe that this is the first report of an infection with carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria resulting in death  attributed to a patient with recent foreign hospitalization. we recommend routine rectal and wound screening for colonization with multiresistant bacteria for patients who have recently been admitted to hospitals outside canada.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin in combination with low-dose colistin against a diverse collection of gram-negative bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the activity of colistin in combination with daptomycin was assessed using 30 gram-negative type strains and multidrug-resistant isolates with defined mechanisms of resistance. daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined with and without sub-inhibitory concentrations of colistin. the activity of daptomycin was not affected with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae or pseudomonas aeruginosa. for colistin-susceptible acinetobacter baumannii, sensitisation factors ranged from 8 to 128 (median 32),  with the daptomycin mic being reduced to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) enterococci susceptibility breakpoint of 4 mug/ml for the atcc 19606 type strain. a combination of daptomycin and colistin may be useful for the treatment of a. baumannii but not infections due to other gram-negative species.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus- the predominant pathogen in the neonatal icu of a tertiary care hospital in amritsar, india.
AB  == background: an early treatment and the appropriate and the rational use of antibiotics would minimize the risk of severe morbidity and mortality in neonatal sepsis, and reduce the emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms in intensive care units. for the success of an early empiric treatment, a periodic review of the cases to assess any changing trends in the infecting organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility is important. aim: to study the most commonly encountered bacterial pathogens which caused neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity patterns, so that guidelines could be prepared for a rational antibiotic therapy. setting and design: this was a retrospective study which was  conducted in the department of microbiology and the neonatal intensive care unit  (nicu) at sgrdimsar, amritsar, during june 2011 to june 2012. methods and materials: blood specimens for culture were drawn from 311 newborns who were admitted in an nicu with sepsis. the specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth. subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. the isolates were identified by doing standard biochemical tests. the antibiotic resistance patterns of the isolates were studied by the kirby bauer disc diffusion technique. results: a total of 131 organisms were isolated from the 311 blood cultures. these included staphylococcus aureus (n=68), coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) (n=30), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=10), acinetobacter baumannii (n=9), escherichia coli (n=05), enterobacter cloacae (n=04), citrobacter diversus (n=02), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=02) and candida (n=01). staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen in both early and late-onset sepsis.  on antibiotic sensitivity testing, 57.35% of the staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. more than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to amikacin. the resistance to the third generation cephalosporins varied between 50-55%. the resistance to ciprofloxacin was quite high; however, most of the isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin. a majority of the isolates were susceptible to piperacillin- tazobactum and imipenem. conclusion: the present study emphasized the importance of periodic surveys on the microbial flora which was encountered in particular neonatal settings to recognize the trend.

TI  == non-nucleoside inhibitors of base, an adenylating enzyme in the siderophore biosynthetic pathway of the opportunistic pathogen acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == siderophores are small-molecule iron chelators produced by bacteria and other microorganisms for survival under iron limiting conditions such as found in a mammalian host. siderophore biosynthesis is essential for the virulence of many important gram-negative pathogens including acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. we performed high-throughput screening against base, which is involved in siderophore biosynthesis in a. baumannii, and identified 6-phenyl-1-(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)-1h-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-4-carboxylic acid 15.  herein we report the synthesis, biochemical, and microbiological evaluation of a  systematic series of analogues of the hts hit 15. analogue 67 is the most potent  analogue with a kd of 2 nm against base. structural characterization of the inhibitors with base reveals that they bind in a unique orientation in the active site, occupying all three substrate binding sites, and thus can be considered as  multisubstrate inhibitors. these results provide a foundation for future studies  aimed at increasing both enzyme potency and antibacterial activity.

TI  == novel derivatives of polymyxins.
AB  == polymyxin b and colistin (polymyxin e) are bactericidal pentacationic lipopeptides that act specifically on gram-negative bacteria, first by disrupting their outermost permeability barrier, the outer membrane (om), and then damaging  the cytoplasmic membrane. both were discovered in the mid-1950s and subsequently  used in intravenous therapy, but soon largely abandoned because of nephrotoxicity. the emergence of extremely multiresistant strains has now forced  clinicians to reinstate them in the therapy of severe infections caused by such strains. this article reviews recent attempts to develop novel derivatives of polymyxins that exhibit less toxicity and greater potency than the existing drugs. in addition, studies of novel des-fatty acyl-polymyxin derivatives that display activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa are included. the review also covers recent studies of derivatives that lack potent bactericidal action, but which disrupt the om, which increases bacterial permeability to other antibiotics, facilitating their entry into the cell.

AB  == introduction: multiresistant nosocomial pathogens, especially gram-negative bacilli (gnb), are a serious problem for public health systems worldwide. due to  their antimicrobial properties, copper alloys have been suggested as an alternative for the control of bacterial burden in surfaces in hospital environment. however, antibiotic multiresistance and copper resistance could be associated in gnb, and there is evidence that both kind of resistance genes (antibiotic and copper) can be located on the same genetic structures. for this reason antibiotic-multiresistant strains could survive in the presence of copper, selecting for bacterial phenotypes resistant to both antibacterial agents. aim: to evaluate antibacterial activity of copper against nosocomial extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) (+) and esbl (-) gnb, and carbapenems resistant or susceptible strains. material and method: this study included 390 strains of gnb  isolated from chilean hospitals: acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant (car r) and susceptible (car s) to carbapenem antibiotics, and klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli producers and non-producers of esbl. susceptibility levels to cupric sulphate were determined by agar dilution method and statistical analysis were used to determine the significance of the differences in the copper tolerance levels between the strains groups. results: statistically superior copper tolerance levels were found in the car r and esbl producing strains of a. baumannii and k. pneumoniae, in relation with the car s and esbl not-producing strains. conclusion: a relation between a diminished susceptibility to ionic copper and to recent generation antimicrobial agents was  observed in k. pneumoniae y a. baumannii strains.

TI  == multidrug-resistant organisms in a routine ward environment: differential propensity for environmental dissemination and implications for infection control.
AB  == multidrug-resistant organisms (mdros) pose significant infection-control challenges in settings with high prevalence and limited isolation facilities. this observational study in an 800-bed hospital determined the prevalence, bacterial density and genetic relatedness of mdros isolated from ward surfaces, medical devices and the hands of healthcare professionals. the targeted mdros were meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and carbapenem-resistant (cr) acinetobacter baumannii. during a 2-month period, microbiological sampling and molecular typing were performed on environment isolates, clinical isolates and isolates recovered  from the hands of healthcare professionals. the target mdros were recovered from  79% of sampled surfaces, predominantly mrsa (74% of all tested surfaces) and cr a. baumannii (29%) but also vre (2%) and k. pneumoniae (1%). mrsa was recovered from most tested surfaces throughout the ward, whilst cr a. baumannii was significantly more likely to be recovered from near-patient surfaces. hand sampling demonstrated infrequent recovery of mrsa (5%), cr a. baumannii (1%) and  vre (1%). molecular typing of the study isolates identified seven mrsa and five acinetobacter clonal clusters, respectively, and typing identified similar strains from the environment, patients and hands. thus, in a healthcare setting with endemic circulation of mdros, mrsa and cr a. baumannii were the predominant  organisms recovered from ward surfaces, with mrsa in particular demonstrating widespread environmental dissemination. molecular typing demonstrated the presence of related strains in patients, in the environment and on the hands of healthcare workers.

TI  == lung abscess in a patient with vap: a rare case of lung infection complicated by  two pathogens.
AB  == ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is defined as pneumonia occurring in a patient after intubation with an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube lasting for 48 hours or more. we describe a case of 75-year-old male who initially presented with pneumonia of the right basis with accompanying plevritis. the patient was intubated and his condition was complicated with a vap infection while he developed a lung abscess. the antibiotic therapy was based on susceptibility bronchial secretions isolated acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae; these pathogens were also isolated from the drained abscess. the patient was discharged in good health. the interest of this case is  recommended in the existence of two responsible pathogens, the paucity of the development of lung abscess in a patient with vap, and the successful treatment of the patient with the combination of controlled drainage of the abscess and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TI  == [epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of clinical isolates about hospital infection from patients with hematological diseases].
AB  == objective: to investigate the epidemiology and antibiotic resistance of isolates  from hospitalized patients with hematological disease from 2005 to 2011. methods: a total of 1453 bacterial strains were isolated from patients with hematological  disease from january 2005 to december 2011. antimicrobial susceptibility testing  was performed by micro-dilution method. results: (1) the majority of the bacterial strains were respiratory passage examples (57.5%). the portage of blood examples in our division (13.60%) was higher than of whole hospital (6.26%), with lower positive rate of bacterial culture (52.37%) than of whole hospital (60.24%). chemotherapy-induced agranulocytosis was the main reason for hospital infection. 578 (39.8%) bacterial strains were gram positive, and 875 (60.2%) gram negative bacillus. staphylococcus epidermidis strains and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. (2) methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) accounted for 72.8% antibiotic resistance. detection rates of esbls in escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were 18.9% and 10.4%, respectively. (3) no obvious changes of antimicrobial resistances of staphylococcus and enterococcus were observed during these years. the enterobacteriaceae strains showed lowest resistance rates to carbapenems, next to cefoperazone/sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam. but the resistance rates of escherichia coli to cefepime and ceftazidime were gradually increasing during the past years. pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii of glucose nonfermenters showed lowest resistance rates to cefoperazone/sulbactam, but the resistance rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa to carbapenems increased. conclusions: escherichia coli was the highest in quantity of gram negative bacillus and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. the resistance rates of escherichia coli to cefepime  and ceftazidime, pseudomonas aeruginosa to carbapenems were gradually increasing  in the past years.

TI  == epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance among commonly encountered bacteria associated with infections and colonization in intensive care units in a university-affiliated hospital in shanghai.
AB  == background/purpose: the aim of this study was to classify intensive care unit (icu) bacterial strains as either icu-acquired or icu-on-admission and to compare their epidemiological and antibiogram characteristics. methods: the study was performed in a 1300-bed university-affiliated hospital from january 1, 2006 to december 31, 2010. based on the time of icu admission, icu isolates were classified as icu-acquired strains (appearing more than 48 hours after admission) or icu-on-admission strains (appearing 48 hours or less from admission). the microbiological data before icu admission, the microbiological data, and susceptibility testing were compared between the icu-acquired and icu-on-admission bacterial isolates. results: the most common icu-acquired strains were acinetobacter baumannii (19.5%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.6%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (11.5%), staphylococcus aureus (10.7%), enterococcus spp. (10.6%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (9.7%). there were significant differences between icu-acquired and icu-on-admission isolates in the susceptibility rates of gram-negative bacteria to antibiotics, especially the susceptibility of a. baumannii to imipenem [23.8% (icu-acquired) vs. 44.4% (icu-on-admission), p < 0.001] and meropenem (24.1% vs. 37.8%, p < 0.001), and the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to imipenem (39.3% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001) and  meropenem (58.5% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.05). furthermore, decreased susceptibility rates of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa to carbapenems were correlated with an extended icu stay (p < 0.05). conclusion: because of decreasing susceptibility rates of pathogens (especially icu-acquired strains) and a significant correlation with the length of icu stay, intensivists should consider a patient's time of icu admission and previous microbiological data and should distinguish icu-acquired strains from non-icu-acquired strains so as to initiate optimized empirical antibiotic therapy against icu-acquired infections.

TI  == biofilm formation by clinical isolates and the implications in chronic infections.
AB  == background: biofilm formation is a major virulence factor contributing to the chronicity of infections. to date few studies have evaluated biofilm formation in infecting isolates of patients including both gram-positive and gram-negative multidrug-resistant (mdr) species in the context of numerous types of infectious  syndromes. herein, we investigated the biofilm forming capacity in a large collection of single patient infecting isolates and compared the relationship between biofilm formation to various strain characteristics. methods: the biofilm-forming capacity of 205 randomly sampled clinical isolates from patients, collected from various anatomical sites, admitted for treatment at brooke army medical center (bamc) from 2004-2011, including methicillin-resistant/methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mrsa/mssa) (n=23), acinetobacter baumannii (n=53), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=36), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=54), and escherichia coli (n=39), were evaluated for biofilm formation using the high-throughput microtiter plate assay and scanning electron microscopy (sem). relationships between biofilm formation to clonal type, site of isolate collection, and mdr phenotype were evaluated. furthermore, in patients with relapsing infections, serial strains were assessed for their ability to form biofilms in vitro. results: of the 205 clinical isolates tested, 126 strains (61.4%) were observed to form biofilms in vitro at levels greater than or equal to the staphylococcus epidermidis, positive biofilm producing strain, with p. aeruginosa and s. aureus having the greatest number of biofilm producing strains. biofilm formation was significantly associated with specific clonal types, the site of isolate collection, and strains positive for biofilm formation were more  frequently observed to be mdr. in patients with relapsing infections, the majority of serial isolates recovered from these individuals were observed to be  strong biofilm producers in vitro. conclusions: this study is the first to evaluate biofilm formation in a large collection of infecting clinical isolates representing diverse types of infections. our results demonstrate: (1) biofilm formation is a heterogeneous property amongst clinical strains which is associated with certain clonal types, (2) biofilm forming strains are more frequently isolated from non-fluid tissues, in particular bone and soft tissues,  (3) mdr pathogens are more often biofilm formers, and (4) strains from patients with persistent infections are positive for biofilm formation.

TI  == recent trends in resistance to cell envelope-active antibacterial agents among key bacterial pathogens.
AB  == cell envelope-active agents, particularly beta-lactams, play a pivotal role in the treatment of bacterial infections and the extent to which their activity is affected by the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms is of concern. we analyzed the surveillance network (tsn) database to evaluate resistant trends for key cell envelope-active drugs among eskape pathogens. analysis demonstrated that the activity of these drugs has been notably influenced by the emergence of multidrug resistance; this was especially evident for the beta-lactam drugs. for  example, acinetobacter baumannii resistance to imipenem increased from 23.9% to 34.3%, and resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam increased from 37.0% to 49.7% between 2007 and 2011. during the same time period klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to imipenem increased from 0.8% to 3.8%. as beta-lactams are a cornerstone of anti-infective therapy, it is important to closely monitor the activity of the agents being used today and to aggressively pursue new strategies that can augment current drugs and thwart ever-emerging beta-lactam resistance mechanisms that are continuously encountered.

TI  == [pathogens and risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia in neonates].
AB  == objective: to study the pathogens, drug sensitivity and risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) in neonates. methods: retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical data of 401 neonates who were admitted to  the neonatal intensive care unit and received mechanical ventilation for 48 hours or longer from january 2008 to february 2012. eighty-five of the 401 neonates suffered vap. results: the main pathogens for vap were gram-negative bacteria (97%), including klebsiella pneumoniae (51%), acinetobacter baumannii (17%) and escherichia coli (12%) as the three most frequent ones. the drug sensitivity test showed that these pathogens developed resistance to amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefazolin, and cefotaxime, with a susceptibility rate of below 15%, and demonstrated decreased sensitivity to imipenem and meropenem, with a susceptibility rate of below 75%. the independent risk factors for neonatal vap included birth weight (or=1.399, p<0.05), duration of mechanical ventilation (or=1.966, p<0.01), length of hospital stay (or=1.812, p<0.01), times of tracheal intubation (or=2.056, p<0.01), and 1 min apgar score (or=2.146, p<0.01). conclusions: the incidence of  neonatal vap is influenced by many factors. the main pathogens for neonatal vap are gram-negative bacteria and antibacterial agents should be properly used according to drug sensitivity test results. comprehensive prevention and control  measures should be taken to reduce the incidence of vap.

TI  == emergence of imipenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli in intestinal flora of intensive care patients.
AB  == intestinal flora contains a reservoir of gram-negative bacilli (gnb) resistant to cephalosporins, which are potentially pathogenic for intensive care unit (icu) patients; this has led to increasing use of carbapenems. the emergence of carbapenem resistance is a major concern for icus. therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess the intestinal carriage of imipenem-resistant gnb (ir-gnb) in intensive care patients. for 6 months, 523 consecutive icu patients were screened for rectal ir-gnb colonization upon admission and weekly thereafter. the phenotypes and genotypes of all isolates were determined, and a case control study was performed to identify risk factors for colonization. the ir-gnb colonization rate increased regularly from 5.6% after 1 week to 58.6% after 6 weeks in the icu. in all, 56 ir-gnb strains were collected from 50 patients: 36 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 12 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 6 enterobacteriaceae strains, and 2 acinetobacter baumannii strains. in p. aeruginosa, imipenem resistance was due to chromosomally encoded resistance (32 strains) or carbapenemase production (4 strains). in the enterobacteriaceae strains, resistance was due to ampc cephalosporinase and/or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production with porin loss. genomic comparison showed that the strains were highly diverse, with 8 exceptions (4 vim-2 carbapenemase-producing p. aeruginosa strains, 2 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, and 2 s. maltophilia strains). the main risk factor for ir-gnb colonization was prior imipenem exposure. the odds ratio for colonization was already as high as 5.9 (95% confidence interval [95% ci], 1.5 to 25.7) after 1 to 3 days of exposure and increased to 7.8 (95% ci, 2.4 to 29.8) thereafter. in conclusion, even brief exposure to imipenem is a major risk factor for ir-gnb carriage.

TI  == effect of low-dose gaseous ozone on pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: treatment of chronically infected wounds is a challenge, and bacterial environmental contamination is a growing issue in infection control. ozone may have a role in these situations. the objective of this study was to determine whether a low dose of gaseous ozone/oxygen mixture eliminates pathogenic bacteria cultivated in petri dishes. methods: a pilot study with 6 bacterial strains was made using different concentrations of ozone in an ozone-oxygen mixture to determine a minimally effective dose that completely eliminated bacterial growth. the small and apparently bactericidal gaseous dose of 20 mug/ml ozone/oxygen (1:99) mixture, applied for 5 min under atmospheric pressure was selected. in the 2nd phase, eight bacterial strains with well characterized resistance patterns were evaluated in vitro using agar-blood in adapted petri dishes (105 bacteria/dish). the cultures were divided into 3 groups: 1--ozone-oxygen gaseous mixture containing 20 mug of o(3)/ml for 5 min; 2--100% oxygen for 5 min; 3--baseline: no gas was used. results: the selected ozone dose was applied to the following eight strains: escherichia coli, oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter baumannii susceptible only to carbapenems, and pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. all isolates were completely inhibited by the ozone-oxygen mixture while growth occurred in the other 2 groups. conclusion: a single topical application by nebulization of a low ozone dose completely inhibited the growth of all potentially pathogenic bacterial strains with known resistance to antimicrobial agents.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of copper surfaces against carbapenemase-producing contemporary gram-negative clinical isolates.
AB  == objectives: the antimicrobial activity of copper surfaces against a variety of contemporary carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria representative of the most problematic nosocomial pathogens worldwide was evaluated. methods: twenty-four clinical isolates, comprising four of escherichia coli, two of enterobacter spp., eight of klebsiella pneumoniae and five each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii producing either vim-1 and/or kpc-2 or vim-2 or oxa-type carbapenemases, were studied. the antimicrobial activity of 99% copper (cu99%) and a 63% alloy (cu63%) was evaluated in comparison with that of stainless steel (ss) and polyvinylchloride (pvc) by incubating approximately 10(6) cfu/cm(2) of the tested strains on each surface at room temperature. results: copper demonstrated antimicrobial activity against all studied isolates. this effect was observed earlier and was more pronounced for cu99% than for cu63%. cu99% showed a bactericidal effect after <2 h for a. baumannii, 3 h for enterobacter spp., 5 h for k. pneumoniae and 6 h for p. aeruginosa and e. coli. no viable colonies were recovered from five (20.8%) isolates after 3 h and from nine (37.5%) isolates after 5 h of incubation on cu99%. conclusions: copper has significant antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant nosocomial gram-negative pathogens. this supports the hypothesis that replacement of high-contact materials with copper could reduce the high burden of environmental  contamination around high-risk patients. however, this strategy should be seen as an adjunctive measure to established cleaning protocols and to good hygiene practices for prevention of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acid exhibit potent bactericidal activity against eskape pathogens.
AB  == a series of 36 synthetic antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acids  were screened to determine their effectiveness to treat enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pnemoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species (eskape) pathogens, which are known to commonly infect chronic wounds. the primary amino acid sequences of these peptides incorporate either three or six dipeptide units consisting of the unnatural amino acids tetrahydroisoquinolinecarboxylic acid (tic) and octahydroindolecarboxylic acid (oic). the tic-oic dipeptide units are separated by spacer amino acids with specific physicochemical properties that control how these peptides interact with bacterial cell membranes of different chemical compositions. these peptides exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) against these pathogens in the range from >100 to 6.25 mug/ml. the observed diversity of mic values for these peptides against the various bacterial strains  are consistent with our hypothesis that the complementarity of the physicochemical properties of the peptide and the lipid of the bacteria's cell membrane determines the resulting antibacterial activity of the peptide.

TI  == comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: india.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. materials and methods: seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating  isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of salmonella typhi and candida  albicans. reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. a very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. results: the highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by  desnet (5.05) and bacillocid special (5.02). a comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for lysol, bacillocid sp. and desnet, respectively. in the discard jars, bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, desnet for 3 days and hi-giene germitol for 1 day. the remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on day 1. phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like desnet and bacillocid special. conclusions: newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

TI  == detection of bacterial 16s rrna and identification of four clinically important bacteria by real-time pcr.
AB  == within the paradigm of clinical infectious disease research, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa represent the four most clinically relevant, and hence most extensively studied bacteria. current culture-based methods for identifying these organisms are slow  and cumbersome, and there is increasing need for more rapid and accurate molecular detection methods. using bioinformatic tools, 962,279 bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences were aligned, and regions of homology were selected to generate a set of real-time pcr primers that target 93.6% of all bacterial 16s rrna sequences published to date. a set of four species-specific real-time pcr primer pairs were also designed, capable of detecting less than 100 genome copies of a. baumannii, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa. all primers were tested for specificity in vitro against 50 species of gram-positive and -negative bacteria. additionally, the species-specific primers were tested against a panel  of 200 clinical isolates of each species, randomly selected from a large repository of clinical isolates from diverse areas and sources. a comparison of culture and real-time pcr demonstrated 100% concordance. the primers were incorporated into a rapid assay capable of positive identification from plate or  broth cultures in less than 90 minutes. furthermore, our data demonstrate that current targets, such as the uida gene in e.coli, are not suitable as species-specific genes due to sequence variation. the assay described herein is rapid, cost-effective and accurate, and can be easily incorporated into any research laboratory capable of real-time pcr.

TI  == [analysis on the clinical pulmonary infection score on the detection of multidrug resistance organisms in lower respiratory tract in ventilated patients in intensive care unit].
AB  == objective: to investigate the characteristics of multidrug resistance (mdr) organisms from the lower respiratory tract in ventilated patients, and the constitution, detection time and mortality of the intensive care unit (icu) patients with different clinical pulmonary infection scores (cpis). methods: a retrospective study was conducted. the clinical data of 72 cases with lower respiratory tract mdr on ventilation more than 48 hours were collected from april 2010 to december 2011. cpis were calculated at the same time. thirty-three patients with cpis>6 were diagnosed as ventilation associated pneumonia (vap), while 39 having cpis </=6 (non-vap). the characteristics of mdr, the detection time and mortality of the patients were compared between the two groups. results: the first five mdr were baumannii [49.5%(34/74)], klebsiella pneumoniae [24.3%(18/74)], escherichia coli [20.3%(15/74)], pseudomonas aeruginosa [5.4%(4/74)] and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [mrsa, 4.1%(3/74)] in vap group, while the first five were escherichia coli [40.2%(37/92)], pseudomonas aeruginosa [33.7%(31/92)], klebsiella pneumoniae [13.1%(12/92)], baumannii [8.7%(8/92)] and mrsa [4.3%(4/92)] in non-vap group. there was no significant difference in average detection time between vap group and non-vap group (10.7+/-1.5 days vs. 9.4+/-1.8 days, p>0.05). the mortality rate in vap group was significantly higher than that in non-vap group (39.4% vs. 23.1%, p<0.05). conclusions: different mdr may be detected in lower respiratory tracts no matter the ventilated patients having vap or not, which influence the patients prognosis and should be monitored intensively. antibiotics should be empirically  prescribed and adjusted dynamically.

TI  == pharmacodynamic profiling of doripenem, imipenem and meropenem against prevalent  gram-negative organisms in the asia-pacific region.
AB  == carbapenems are increasingly being utilised owing to the escalating prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacteria from community and hospital settings. in this study, pharmacodynamic profiles of doripenem, imipenem and meropenem were evaluated against gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalised patients. mics for carbapenems were determined for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii obtained from the compact ii programme conducted in the asia-pacific region. monte carlo simulations were undertaken to assess the pharmacodynamic profile of  carbapenems against each of the pathogens. all carbapenem regimens achieved optimal exposures [cumulative fraction of response (cfr) >/=90%] against e. coli  and k. pneumoniae. against p. aeruginosa, doripenem achieved 81.3-95.3% cfr, imipenem achieved 55.2-77.9% cfr and meropenem achieved 71.9-91.3% cfr; only doripenem regimens of 4-h infusion of 1000 mg every 8h (q8h) and 1-h and 4-h infusion of 2000 mg q8h and a meropenem regimen of 3-h infusion of 2000 mg q8h obtained optimal exposures; all carbapenem regimens showed slight (1-7%) improvement in cfrs in favour of isolates collected from icu sources. against a.  baumannii, cfrs were much lower (25.9-46.7% cfr) and no carbapenem regimens achieved optimal exposure in or outside the icu. owing to the high potency of carbapenems against these enterobacteriaceae populations, standard regimens are likely to perform well in the asia-pacific region. however, larger doses combined with prolonged infusions will be required to increase the cfr for these carbapenems against resistant non-fermenting gram-negatives such as p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii that are prevalent in these countries.

TI  == impact of susceptibility profiles of gram-negative bacteria before and after the  introduction of ertapenem at a medical center in northern taiwan from 2004 to 2010.
AB  == this retrospective observational study evaluated the impact of antimicrobial consumption on antimicrobial susceptibility among aerobic gram-negative bacteria  after introducing ertapenem to the formulary of a teaching hospital (1130 beds) in northern taiwan. data on consumption of various antimicrobial agents, expressed as defined daily dose/1000 patient-days (ddd/1000 pd), were collected retrospectively from hospital pharmacy records 2 years before and 5 years after the introduction of ertapenem (october 2005). during the study period, the consumption of ampicillin and aminoglycosides decreased significantly. in contrast, the consumption of cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems (ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin) increased significantly over time. there was a significant increase in the rate of susceptibility of escherichia coli to ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefpirome, amikacin, and levofloxacin; an increase in the rate of susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, levofloxacin, and amikacin; a significant decrease in the rate of susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa to meropenem; and a significant decrease in the rate of susceptibility of acinetobacter baumannii to ceftazidime, carbapenems, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. the rate of antibiotic susceptibility to ertapenem of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producers, including e. coli and k. pneumoniae, remained  stable. usage of ertapenem was found to be negatively and significantly associated with the susceptibility rates of p. aeruginosa to meropenem and gentamicin. significantly negative correlations were noted between the use of ertapenem and the rates of susceptibility of a. baumannii to ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem), ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin.

TI  == rapid detection and statistical differentiation of kpc gene variants in gram-negative pathogens by use of high-resolution melting and screenclust analyses.
AB  == in the united states, the production of the klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc) is an important mechanism of carbapenem resistance in gram-negative pathogens. infections with kpc-producing organisms are associated with increased  morbidity and mortality; therefore, the rapid detection of kpc-producing pathogens is critical in patient care and infection control. we developed a real-time pcr assay complemented with traditional high-resolution melting (hrm) analysis, as well as statistically based genotyping, using the rotor-gene screenclust hrm software to both detect the presence of bla(kpc) and differentiate between kpc-2-like and kpc-3-like alleles. a total of 166 clinical  isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii with various beta-lactamase susceptibility patterns were tested in the  validation of this assay; 66 of these organisms were known to produce the kpc beta-lactamase. the real-time pcr assay was able to detect the presence of bla(kpc) in all 66 of these clinical isolates (100% sensitivity and specificity). hrm analysis demonstrated that 26 had kpc-2-like melting peak temperatures, while 40 had kpc-3-like melting peak temperatures. sequencing of 21 amplified products  confirmed the melting peak results, with 9 isolates carrying bla(kpc-2) and 12 isolates carrying bla(kpc-3). this pcr/hrm assay can identify kpc-producing gram-negative pathogens in as little as 3 h after isolation of pure colonies and  does not require post-pcr sample manipulation for hrm analysis, and screenclust analysis easily distinguishes bla(kpc-2-like) and bla(kpc-3-like) alleles. therefore, this assay is a rapid method to identify the presence of bla(kpc) enzymes in gram-negative pathogens that can be easily integrated into busy clinical microbiology laboratories.

TI  == adenylate kinase release as a high-throughput-screening-compatible reporter of bacterial lysis for identification of antibacterial agents.
AB  == adenylate kinase (ak) is a ubiquitous intracellular enzyme that is released into  the extracellular space upon cell lysis. we have shown that ak release serves as  a useful reporter of bactericidal agent activity and can be exploited for antimicrobial screening purposes. the ak assay exhibits improved sensitivity over that of growth-based assays and can detect agents that are active against bacteria in clinically relevant growth states that are difficult to screen using  conventional approaches, such as small colony variants (scv) and bacteria within  established biofilms. the usefulness of the ak assay was validated by screening a library of off-patent drugs for agents that exhibit antimicrobial properties toward a variety of bacterial species, including escherichia coli and all members of the "eskape" pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species). the assay detected antibiotics within the library that were expected to be active against the organism screened. moreover, 38 drugs with no previously reported antibacterial activity elicited ak release. four of these  were acquired, and all were verified to exhibit antimicrobial activity by standard susceptibility testing. two of these molecules were further characterized. the antihistamine, terfenadine, was active against s. aureus planktonic, scv population, and biofilm-associated cells. tamoxifen, an estrogen  receptor antagonist, was active toward e. faecium in vitro and also reduced e. faecium pathogenesis in a galleria mellonella infection model. our data demonstrate that the ak assay provides an attractive screening approach for identifying new antimicrobial agents. further, terfenadine and tamoxifen may represent novel antimicrobial drug development scaffolds.

AB  == background: in this era of increasing antimicrobial resistance, infections caused by multi-drug-resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacilli (gnb) are becoming more common and pose a challenge to all clinicians, including surgeons. methods: we evaluated the epidemiology and antimicrobial sensitivities of gnb isolated from patients treated on surgical wards at the university hospital of heraklion, crete, greece, from 2004 to 2009. the mdr isolates were defined according to an international expert proposal supported by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention and the european centre for disease prevention and control. results: a total of 1,153 gnb were isolated; 536 (46.5%) were mdr. the most common isolates were escherichia coli (312 [27.8%]; mdr rate 50.2%), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (298 [25.8%]; mdr rate 39.6%), acinetobacter baumannii (137 [11.9%]; mdr rate 83.9%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (112 [9.7%]; mdr rate 44.6%). most pathogens were isolated from patients hospitalized in the departments of surgical oncology (32.3%), orthopedic and trauma surgery (31.8%), general surgery (18.1%), and pediatric surgery (15.5%). the clinical specimens comprised pus (45.1%), normally sterile fluids (22.5%), urine (16.8%), blood (6.3%), and other body fluids. most effective in vitro against all mdr pathogens were colistin (83%), meropenem (57%), and imipenem-cilastatin (56%). the mdr p. aeruginosa was susceptible most often to colistin (94%) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin 56%, amikacin 55%), mdr a. baumannii only to colistin (94%), and mdr k. pneumoniae to  meropenem (92%) and aminoglycosides (amikacin 76%, gentamicin 74%). conclusion: in a region with a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance, almost one-half of gnb isolated from surgical patients were mdr. surgeons may consider these developments to guide empiric antibiotic therapy for infections caused by gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance of the most frequently isolated microorganisms in the hospital general la mancha centro between june 2009 and may 2010].
AB  == introduction: during the last two decades an increased incidence of infections caused by multiresistant bacteria has been observed. the spread of these microorganisms in the hospital is a major therapeutic and epidemiological problem. the aim of this study was to determine local resistance patterns of microorganisms causative of multirresistant infections in patients admitted to our hospital. methods: a retrospective study was designed, including staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from clinical and surveillance samples of patients admitted to the hospital general la mancha centro, between june 2009 and may 2010. results: the rate of s. aureus isolates resistant to oxacillin was 50%, with 0% resistance to vancomycin. the percentage  of resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins in e. coli and k. pneumoniae was 17 and 19%, respectively; the esbl-production in enterobacterial strains was 15 and 19%, respectively, and the quinolone resistance was 41 and 28%, respectively. the resistance of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime and imipenem was 30 and 40%, respectively. most strains of a. baumannii studied came from a single multidrug-resistant clone, endemic in the icu of our hospital. conclusions: of particular concern is the high rate of mrsa, e. coli and k. pneumoniae esbl producers and resistant to fluoroquinolones as well as p. aeruginosa multiresistant. a. baumannii isolates belong mainly to endemic multidrug-resistant clone from the icu.

TI  == oxybiotest project: microorganisms under pressure. hyperbaric oxygen (hbo) and simple pressure interaction on selected bacteria.
AB  == background: hyperbaric oxygen (hbo) therapy involves exposure to pure oxygen in a pressurized room, and it is an already well-established treatment for various conditions, including those originated by serious infections. starting from the observation of an increased number of patients who were accessing our hbo units for diseases supported from concomitant multidrug-resistant microorganisms, as well as considering the evident clinical benefit and laboratory final outcome of  those patients at the end of the treatment, aim of our study was to measure, or better define at least, if there was any interaction between a hyperbaric environment and some selected microorganisms and if those positive results were due to the increased oxygen partial pressure (po2) value or just to the increased pressure, regardless of the fraction of inspired oxygen (fio2) applied (21/100%). design and methods: we applied various increased po2 values in a hyperbaric environment. our study design was tailored in four steps to answer four specific  questions, ordered in a progressive process: oxybiotest (obt)-1,2,3, and 4. specifically, we chose to investigate possible changes in the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic) and in the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of multi-resistant microorganisms after a single session of hyperbaric therapy. results: obt-1 and obt-2 provide a semi-quantitative confirmation of the bacterio-cidal and cytostatic effects of hbo. hbo is cidal only if the total exposure pressure is elevated, and cidal or cytostatic effect are not always dependent on the po2 applied.obt-4 has shown the adjuvant effect of hbo and antimicrobial drug against some selected bacteria. discussion: we seem allowed to hypothesize that only in case of a good approach to a lesion, permitting smaller  bacterial loads thanks to surgical debridement and/or eventual antibiotic therapy for example, you can observe the clear effectiveness of the hyperbaric oxygen (hbo) exposure as a valid adjuvant therapy, even when that lesion is substained from multidrug-resistant micro-organisms. on the contrary when the bacterial load is very high we observe an unchanged situation or a just a slightly diminishing in the number of cfu/ml. conclusions: even if confined in this 'in vitro' environment and in a single treatment, just knowing the microorganism strain responsible of the lesion we seem allowed to both weight the possible related effectiveness using hbo therapy (hbot) and derive the best po2 to treat the case. a further possible development of the study highlights a comparison between acinetobacter baumannii (acba) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (psae), and escherichia coli (esco) and klebsiella pneumoniae (klpn).

TI  == pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 'old' polymyxins: what is new?
AB  == 'old' colistin and polymyxin b are increasingly used as last-line therapy against multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter  baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae. for intravenous administration, colistin is dosed as its inactive prodrug colistin methanesulfonate (sodium), while polymyxin b is used as its sulfate (active antibacterial). over the last decade, significant progress has been made in understanding their chemistry, pharmacokinetics (pk), and pharmacodynamics (pd). the first scientifically based  dosing suggestions are now available for colistin methanesulfonate to generate a  desired target steady-state plasma concentration of formed colistin in various categories of critically ill patients. as simply increasing polymyxin dosage regimens is not an option for optimizing their pk/pd due to nephrotoxicity, combination therapy with other antibiotics has great potential to maximize the efficacy of polymyxins while minimizing emergence of resistance. we must pursue rational approaches to the use of polymyxins and other existing antibiotics through the application of pk/pd principles.

TI  == national institute of allergy and infectious disease (niaid) funding for studies  of hospital-associated bacterial pathogens: are funds proportionate to burden of  disease?
AB  == background: hospital-associated infections (hais) are associated with a considerable burden of disease and direct costs greater than $17 billion. the pathogens that cause the majority of serious hais are enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium difficile, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species, referred as esckape. we aimed to determine the amount of funding the national institute of health (nih) national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) allocates to research on antimicrobial resistant pathogens, particularly  esckape pathogens. methods: the nih research portfolio online reporting tools (report) database was used to identify niaid antimicrobial resistance research grants funded in 2007-2009 using the terms "antibiotic resistance," "antimicrobial resistance," and "hospital-associated infection." results: funding for antimicrobial resistance grants has increased from 2007-2009. antimicrobial resistance funding for bacterial pathogens has seen a smaller increase than non-bacterial pathogens. the total funding for all eskcape pathogens was $ 22,005,943 in 2007, $ 30,810,153 in 2008 and $ 49,801,227 in 2009. s. aureus grants received $ 29,193,264 in fy2009, the highest funding amount of all the esckape pathogens. based on 2009 funding data, approximately $1,565 of research money was spent per s. aureus related death and $750 of was spent per c. difficile related death. conclusions: although the funding for esckape pathogens  has increased from 2007 to 2009, funding levels for antimicrobial resistant bacteria-related grants is still lower than funding for antimicrobial resistant non-bacterial pathogens. efforts may be needed to improve research funding for resistant-bacterial pathogens, particularly as their clinical burden increases.

TI  == in vivo-validated essential genes identified in acinetobacter baumannii by using  human ascites overlap poorly with essential genes detected on laboratory media.
AB  == a critical feature of a potential antimicrobial target is the characteristic of being essential for growth and survival during host infection. for bacteria, genome-wide essentiality screens are usually performed on rich laboratory media.  this study addressed whether genes detected in that manner were optimal for the identification of antimicrobial targets since the in vivo milieu is fundamentally different. mutant derivatives of a clinical isolate of acinetobacter baumannii were screened for growth on human ascites, an ex vivo medium that reflects the infection environment. a subset of 34 mutants with unique gene disruptions that demonstrated little to no growth on ascites underwent evaluation in a rat subcutaneous abscess model, establishing 18 (53%) of these genes as in vivo essential. the putative gene products all had annotated biological functions, represented unrecognized or underexploited antimicrobial targets, and could be grouped into five functional categories: metabolic, two-component signaling systems, dna/rna synthesis and regulation, protein transport, and structural. these a. baumannii in vivo essential genes overlapped poorly with the sets of essential genes from other gram-negative bacteria catalogued in the database of essential genes (deg), including those of acinetobacter baylyi, a closely related species. however, this finding was not due to the absence of orthologs. none of the 18 in vivo essential genes identified in this study, or their putative gene products, were targets of fda-approved drugs or drugs in the developmental pipeline, indicating that a significant portion of the available target space within pathogenic gram-negative bacteria is currently neglected. importance: the  human pathogen acinetobacter baumannii is of increasing clinical importance, and  a growing proportion of isolates are multiantimicrobial-resistant, pan-antimicrobial-resistant, or extremely resistant strains. this scenario is reflective of the general problem of a critical lack of antimicrobials effective  against antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and escherichia coli. this study identified a set of a. baumannii genes that are essential for growth and survival during infection and demonstrated the importance of using clinically relevant media and in vivo validation while screening for essential genes for the purpose of developing new antimicrobials. furthermore, it established that if a gene is absent from the database of essential genes, it should not be excluded as a potential antimicrobial target. lastly, a new set of high-value potential antimicrobial targets for pathogenic gram-negative bacteria has been identified.

TI  == is there a direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a?
AB  == study type--therapy (case series) level of evidence 4. what's known on the subject? and what does the study add? several studies describe a reduction of symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity after intradetrusor injections of botulinum neurotoxin a (bont/a). it was, however, unclear if a direct antibacterial effect of bont/a plays a role  in this clinical observation. this is the first study to investigate a potential  antibacterial effect of two frequently used bont/a formulations (i.e. botox(r) and dysport(r)), providing evidence that bont/a does not exert an antibacterial effect on lower urinary tract pathogens. objective: * to determine a potential direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a (bont/a). materials and methods: * a prospective study was carried out using onabotulinumtoxin a (botox(r)) and abobotulinumtoxin a (dypsort(r)) in agar diffusion and broth microdilution assays with various clinical urinary tract isolates (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella oxytoca and bacillus subtilis). * inhibition zones (mm) of bacteria around a disc containing 20 microl saline with 4 iu of botox(r) were measured in the agar diffusion assay. * minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics, iu/ml) of both toxins for all bacteria were determined in the broth microdilution assay after overnight incubation at 35 degrees c. results: * there was no inhibition zone in the agar diffusion assays with any bacterial strain. * the microdilution test using botox(r) and dysport(r) showed bacterial growth in all dilutions, i.e. mics > 20 and >100 iu/ml for botox(r) and dysport(r), respectively. conclusions: * bont/a has no direct antimicrobial effect. * the reduced frequency of symptomatic urinary tract infections (sutis) in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (ndo) after  bont/a intradetrusor injections seems to be caused by different indirect mechanisms, which are still not completely understood.

TI  == comparison of antimicrobial resistance in neonatal and adult intensive care units in a tertiary teaching hospital.
AB  == intrahospital variations in antimicrobial profiles may be related to many factors. this study compared causative agents of nosocomial bloodstream infections between a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) that adopted a ward-tailored antibiotic policy and adult intensive care units (icus). data on organisms from blood cultures obtained from the respective wards between 2005 and 2009 were analyzed. compared with the adult icus, the nicu had a higher frequency of enterobacteriacae and lower frequencies of typical hospital-acquired pathogens (eg, klebsiella pneumoniae, 17.4% vs 10.0% [p < .001]; acinetobacter baumannii, 3.9% vs 11.6% [p < .001]). antibiotic resistance of gram-negative organisms was also significantly lower in the nicu, including resistance to imipenem (5.7% vs 32.1%; p < .001), amikacin (8.8% vs 30.3%), and ceftriaxone (36.1% vs 74.6%; p <  .001). this could possibly be due to the ward-tailored antibiotic policy adopted  by the nicu but not by the other icus.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to describe inhaled colistin pharmacokinetics in patients with ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (vat) due to polymyxin-only susceptible gram-negative bacteria (gnb). methods: inhaled  colistimethate sodium (cms) was administered at a dose of 80 mg every 8 h for 7 days. mini bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) was performed before and at 1, 4 and 8 h, while blood samples were collected before and at 0.16, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h after the first dose. colistin concentrations in bal and serum were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. results: our study population included 20 patients. at the end of treatment, cure was achieved in 16 patients and favorable microbiological response in 12 patients. median (25-75 % interquartile range) colistin concentrations in epithelial lining fluid (elf) were 6.7 (4.8-10.1), 3.9 (2.5-6.0) and 2.0 (1.0-3.8) mug/ml at 1, 4 and 8 h, respectively, and fivefold higher than those achieved in serum. median elf concentrations at 1 and 4 h were  above the minimum inhibitory concentrations of all isolated pathogens; however, the 4-h median was below the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility guidelines (eucast) breakpoints for pseudomonas aeruginosa and the 8-h median was low relative to eucast breakpoints for all gnb. colistin pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters in elf were associated with favorable  microbiological response at the end of treatment. conclusion: inhaled colistin may achieve high drug concentrations in the lung. however, a dose of 80 mg of inhaled cms every 8 h may not be adequate for the treatment of lower respiratory  tract infections due to multi-drug resistant gnb.

TI  == in vitro synergy of colistin combinations against colistin-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates.
AB  == colistin resistance, although uncommon, is increasingly being reported among gram-negative clinical pathogens, and an understanding of its impact on the activity of antimicrobials is now evolving. we evaluated the potential for synergy of colistin plus trimethoprim, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1/19 ratio), or vancomycin against 12 isolates of acinetobacter baumannii (n = 4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4). the strains included six multidrug-resistant clinical isolates, k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, a. baumannii atcc 19606, p. aeruginosa atcc 27853, and their colistin-resistant derivatives (kpm1, abm1, and pam1, respectively). antimicrobial susceptibilities  were assessed by broth microdilution and population analysis profiles. the potential for synergy of colistin combinations was evaluated using a checkerboard assay, as well as static time-kill experiments at 0.5x and 0.25x mic. the mic ranges of vancomycin, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1/19) were >/=128, 4 to >/=128, and 2/38 to >128/2,432 mug/ml, respectively. colistin resistance demonstrated little impact on vancomycin, trimethoprim, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole mic values. isolates with subpopulations heterogeneously resistant to colistin were observed to various degrees in all tested isolates. in time-kill assays, all tested combinations were synergistic against kpm1 at 0.25x mic and 0.5x mic and abm1 and pam1 at 0.5x mic. in contrast, none of the tested combinations demonstrated synergy against any colistin-susceptible p. aeruginosa isolates and clinical strains of k. pneumoniae isolates. only colistin plus trimethoprim or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was synergistic and bactericidal at 0.5x mic against k. pneumoniae atcc 700603. colistin resistance seems to promote the in vitro activity of unconventional colistin combinations. additional experiments are warranted to understand the clinical significance of these observations.

AB  == in 2009, the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) was expanded to include surveillance of gram-negative pathogens causing urinary tract infections (utis) in the asia-pacific region. a total of 1762 isolates were collected from 38 centers in 11 countries from patients with utis in 2009 and 2010. in vitro susceptibilities were determined by the broth microdilution method and susceptibility profiles were determined using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) interpretive criteria, as recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) in 2010 (m100-s20), in 2011 (m100-s21), and in 2012 (m100-s22). enterobacteriaceae comprised 86.0% of the isolates, of which  escherichia coli (56.5%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (13.8%) were the two most common species. amikacin was the most effective antibiotic (91.7%), followed by ertapenem (86.9%), imipenem (86.6%), and piperacillin-tazobactam (84.9%). rates of susceptibility were 50.3% for cefoxitin and ranged from 50.3% to 74.2% for the third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins. for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin,  the susceptibility rates were 51.4% and 54.4%, respectively. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae comprised 28.2% of all isolates. we also found a high rate of resistance to carbapenems among acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa causing uti. interestingly, according to 2012 clsi breakpoints, approximately 33.4% of esbl producers were still susceptible to ceftazidime. however, this in vitro efficacy of ceftazidime  needs to be validated in vivo by clinical data. the lowered clsi interpretive breakpoints for piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems, and some cephalosporins in  2011-2012 for enterobacteriaceae resulted in an approximate 5% drop in susceptibility rates for each drug, with the exception of imipenem for which the  susceptibility rate dropped from 99.4% according to 2010 criteria to 91.2% according to 2011 criteria. with the updated clsi criteria, the antimicrobial resistance threat from uti pathogens in the asia pacific area was revealed to be  more prominent.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections at five medical centers in taiwan that continuously participated in the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart)  from 2006 to 2010.
AB  == the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) is a worldwide surveillance program designed to longitudinally monitor the in vitro activity of  antimicrobial agents against pathogens that cause intra-abdominal infections (iais). in this study, trends in antimicrobial resistance during the period 2006  to 2010 were analyzed at five tertiary-care hospitals in taiwan. enterobacteriaceae accounted for the majority (80.9%) of the 2417 gram-negative isolates, and the two most common species were escherichia coli (38.8%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (23.5%). the rates of susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae  isolates to cephalosporins decreased during the study period. although carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, piperacillin-tazobactam, and amikacin were active  in vitro against more than 80% of the enterobacteriaceae isolates, the activity of carbapenems declined during the study period. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in e. coli was steady, but that in k. pneumoniae decreased during the study period. the rate of esbl-producing species was three-fold higher among patients with nosocomial iais than among patients with community-acquired iais. the majority of isolates from liver were k. pneumoniae (69%) and very few of those isolates were esbl producers (0.9%). pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.3%) and acinetobacter baumannii (3.8%) were the two most common non-enterobacteriaceae. p. aeruginosa showed improved susceptibility, whereas a. baumannii showed a rapid development of resistance during the study period. there was marked geographic variation in resistance patterns of the isolates obtained during the study period. northern taiwan had the highest rate of esbl producers and the highest rate of ceftazidime resistance among p. aeruginosa isolates. central taiwan had the lowest rate of esbl producers but the highest rates of carbapenem resistance  among p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates. continuous monitoring and regular  updates of epidemiological data are needed to guide appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == changing bacteriology of abdominal and surgical sepsis.
AB  == purpose of review: this review focuses on recent changes in epidemiological aspects of bacteria-induced intra-abdominal infections (iais), including the dominant pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, and emerging resistance phenotypes. recent findings: enterobacteriaceae species, including escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, remain the major pathogens contributing to abdominal sepsis, although pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii have recently become common causes of hospital-acquired iais. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli, especially those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), has increased worldwide, although the distribution of those organisms varies from region to region. furthermore, recent changes in interpretive breakpoints for antimicrobial susceptibility testing recommended by the clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) have resulted in a marked increase in the reported rates of resistance among gram-negative bacilli to carbapenems, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. besides, routine detection and reporting of esbl phenotypes for clinical isolates have not been recommended after following new interpretive breakpoints. more studies are needed to investigate the impacts of these changes  on therapeutic strategies and epidemiological surveillance. in addition, pathogens carrying new delhi metallo-beta-lactamases (ndms), k. pneumoniae carbapenemases (kpcs), and other carbapenemases show extended resistance to currently available antibiotics and rapid transfer between species and countries. although some of these pathogens are still susceptible to tigecycline and colistin, rates of resistance to these two agents are rising. summary: abdominal  sepsis due to multidrug-resistant bacteria, especially esbl producers, and international and interspecies spreading of metallo-beta-lactamase raise key therapeutic problems.

AB  == treatment of wounded military personnel at military medical centers is often complicated by colonization and infection of wounds with pathogenic bacteria. these include nosocomially transmitted, often multidrug-resistant pathogens such  as acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex, pseudomonas aeruginosa and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. we analyzed the efficacy of multivalent adhesion molecule (mam) 7-based anti-adhesion treatment of host cells against aforementioned pathogens in a tissue culture infection model. herein, we observed that a correlation between  two important hallmarks of virulence, attachment and cytotoxicity, could serve as a useful predictor for the success of mam7-based inhibition against bacterial infections. initially, we characterized 20 patient isolates (five from each pathogen mentioned above) in terms of genotypic diversity, antimicrobial susceptibility and important hallmarks of pathogenicity (biofilm formation, attachment to and cytotoxicity toward cultured host cells). all isolates displayed a high degree of genotypic diversity, which was also reflected by large strain-to-strain variability in terms of biofilm formation, attachment and cytotoxicity within each group of pathogen. using non-pathogenic bacteria expressing mam7 or latex beads coated with recombinant mam7 for anti-adhesion treatment, we showed a decrease in cytotoxicity, indicating that mam7 has potential as a prophylactic agent to attenuate infection by multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens.

TI  == costs of healthcare- and community-associated infections with antimicrobial-resistant versus antimicrobial-susceptible organisms.
AB  == objective: we compared differences in the hospital charges, length of hospital stay, and mortality between patients with healthcare- and community-associated bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia due to antimicrobial-resistant versus -susceptible bacterial strains. methods: a retrospective analysis of an electronic database compiled from laboratory, pharmacy, surgery, financial, and patient location and device utilization sources was undertaken on 5699 inpatients who developed healthcare- or community-associated infections between 2006 and 2008 from 4 hospitals (1 community, 1 pediatric, 2 tertiary/quaternary care) in manhattan. the main outcome measures were hospital charges, length of stay, and mortality among patients with antimicrobial-resistant and -susceptible infections caused by staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. results: controlling for multiple confounders using linear regression and nearest neighbor matching based on propensity score estimates, resistant healthcare- and community-associated infections, when compared with susceptible strains of the same organism, were associated with significantly higher charges ($15,626; confidence interval [ci], $4339-$26,913 and $25,573; ci, $9331-$41,816, respectively) and longer hospital stays for community-associated infections (3.3; ci, 1.5-5.4). patients with resistant healthcare-associated infections also had a significantly higher death rate (0.04; ci, 0.01-0.08). conclusions: with careful  matching of patients infected with the same organism, antimicrobial resistance was associated with higher charges, length of stay, and death rates. the difference in estimates after accounting for censoring for death highlight divergent social and hospital incentives in reducing patient risk for antimicrobial resistant infections.

TI  == pharmacokinetics of colistin in cerebrospinal fluid after intraventricular administration of colistin methanesulfonate.
AB  == intraventricular colistin, administered as colistin methanesulfonate (cms), is the last resource for the treatment of central nervous system infections caused by panresistant gram-negative bacteria. the doses and daily regimens vary considerably and are empirically chosen; the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) pharmacokinetics of colistin after intraventricular administration of cms has never been characterized. nine patients (aged 18 to 73 years) were treated with intraventricular cms (daily doses of 2.61 to 10.44 mg). colistin concentrations were measured using a selective high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) assay. the population pharmacokinetics analysis was performed with the p-pharm program. the pharmacokinetics of colistin could be best described by the one-compartment model. the estimated values (means +/- standard deviations) of apparent csf total clearance (cl/fm, where fm is the unknown fraction of cms converted to colistin) and terminal half-life (t(1/2lambda)) were 0.033 +/- 0.014 liter/h and 7.8 +/- 3.2 h, respectively, and the average time to the peak concentration was 3.7 +/- 0.9 h. a positive correlation between cl/fm and the amount of csf drained (range 40 to 300 ml) was observed. when cms was administered at doses of >/=5.22 mg/day, measured csf concentrations of colistin  were continuously above the mic of 2 mug/ml, and measured values of trough concentration (c(trough)) ranged between 2.0 and 9.7 mug/ml. microbiological cure was observed in 8/9 patients. intraventricular administration of cms at doses of  >/=5.22 mg per day was appropriate in our patients, but since external csf efflux is variable and can influence the clearance of colistin and its concentrations in csf, the daily dose of 10 mg suggested by the infectious diseases society of america may be more prudent.

TI  == total synthesis and biological evaluation of transvalencin z.
AB  == the emerging global epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis has created an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic approaches for disease treatment. transvalencin z (1) is a natural product from nocardia transvalensis with relatively potent and selective antimycobacterial activity against mycobacterium  smegmatis, making it an attractive target for structure-activity and mechanism of action studies. the total synthesis of the four possible diastereomers of transvalencin z was completed (1a-d), and the absolute configurations were defined using chemical synthesis, hplc retention times, and optical rotation measurements. surprisingly, none of the transvalencin z diastereomers exhibited any inhibitory activity against a panel of microbial pathogens, including several species of mycobacteria.

TI  == analysis of the air/water channels of gastrointestinal endoscopies as a risk factor for the transmission of microorganisms among patients.
AB  == background: for the effective reprocessing of gastrointestinal endoscopes, contaminants must be removed from the entire surface. however, these devices have long and narrow channels that can make this process difficult. methods: in this cross-sectional study, the staff assigned to reprocess gastroscopes and colonoscopes in 37 services located throughout brazil completed a questionnaire regarding reprocessing practices geared toward the channels in these devices. in  addition, samples from these air/water channels were collected for microbiological analysis. results: contamination was detected in 71.8% (28/39) of the samples obtained from the air/water channels of colonoscopes, and in 70% (42/60) of the samples from the air/water channels of gastroscopes. the median microbial load was 1,800 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml in the colonoscopes and 750 cfu/ml in the gastroscopes. the main microorganisms isolated from the air/water channels of gastroscopes were pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.4%), escherichia coli (18.9%), and acinetobacter baumannii (9.4%), and those isolated  from the colonoscopes included p aeruginosa (46.4%), a baumannii (14.3%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (10.7%), among others. the possible causes of the contamination of these devices included the failure to fill these channels with cleaning solution, lack of friction during cleansing, and inadequate rinsing. conclusion: the contamination of the air/water channels did in fact represent a risk for the transmission of microorganisms during gastrointestinal endoscopy exams, possibly related to the inadequate reprocessing of these channels.

TI  == api88 is a novel antibacterial designer peptide to treat systemic infections with multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == the emergence of multiple-drug-resistant (mdr) bacterial pathogens in hospitals (nosocomial infections) presents a global threat of growing importance, especially for gram-negative bacteria with extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or the novel new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (ndm-1) resistance. starting from the antibacterial peptide apidaecin 1b, we have optimized the sequence to treat systemic infections with the most threatening human pathogens,  such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. the lead compound api88 enters bacteria without lytic effects at the membrane and inhibits chaperone dnak at the substrate binding domain with a k(d) of 5 mumol/l. the api88-dnak crystal structure revealed that api88 binds with a seven residue long sequence (pvyiprp), in two different modes. mice did not show any sign of toxicity when api88 was injected four times intraperitoneally at a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight (bw) within 24 h, whereas three injections of 1.25 mg/kg bw and 5 mg/kg bw were sufficient to rescue all animals in lethal sepsis models using pathogenic e. coli strains atcc 25922 and neumann, respectively. radioactive labeling showed that api88 enters all organs investigated including the brain and is cleared through both the liver and kidneys at similar rates. in conclusion, api88 is a novel, highly promising, 18-residue peptide lead compound with favorable in vitro and in vivo properties including a promising safety margin.

TI  == trends in aminoglycoside use and gentamicin-resistant gram-negative clinical isolates in us academic medical centers: implications for antimicrobial stewardship.
AB  == objective: to measure trends in aminoglycoside antibiotic use and gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates across a network of hospitals and compare  network-level relationships with those of individual hospitals. design: longitudinal observational investigation. setting: us academic medical centers. participants: adult inpatients. methods: adult aminoglycoside use was measured from 2002 or 2003 through 2009 in 29 hospitals. hospital-wide antibiograms assessed gentamicin resistance by proportions and incidence rates for pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. mixed-effects analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of changes in aminoglycoside use and changes in resistance rates and proportions. generalized estimating equations were used to assess the relationship between aminoglycoside use and resistance. results: mean aminoglycoside use declined by 41%, reflecting reduced gentamicin (p < .0001) and tobramycin (p < .005) use; amikacin use did not change. the rate and proportion of gentamicin-resistant p. aeruginosa decreased by 48% (p < .0001) and 31% (p < .0001), respectively. the rate and proportion of gentamicin-resistant e. coli increased by 166% and 124%, respectively (p < .0001), and they were related to increasing quinolone resistance in e. coli. resistance among k. pneumoniae and a. baumannii did not change. relationships between aminoglycoside use and resistance at the network level were highly variable at the individual hospital level. conclusions: mean aminoglycoside use declined in this network of us hospitals and was associated with significant and opposite changes in rates of resistance for some organisms and no change for others. at the individual hospital level, antibiograms appear to be an unreliable reflection of antibiotic use, at least for aminoglycosides.

TI  == lif reduces mics of antibiotics against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is an ever-growing problem yet the development of new antibiotics has slowed to a trickle, giving rise to the use of combination therapy to eradicate infections. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined inhibitory effect of lithium fluoride (lif) and commonly used antimicrobials on the growth of the following bacteria: enterococcus faecalis, staphyloccoccus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, streptomycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, alone or combined with lif were performed by microdilution method. mics were determined visually following 18-20 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. we observed reduced mics of antibiotics associated with lif ranging from two-fold to sixteen-fold. the strongest decreases of mics observed were for streptomycin and erythromycin associated with lif against acinetobacter baumannii and streptococcus pneumoniae. an eight-fold reduction was recorded for streptomycin against s. pneumoniae whereas an eight-fold and a sixteen-fold reduction were obtained for erythromycin against a. baumannii and s. pneumoniae. this suggests that lif exhibits a synergistic effect with a wide range of antibiotics and is indicative of its potential as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy.

TI  == the use of multiplex real-time pcr improves the detection of the bacterial etiology of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially to children and compromised hosts, such as the old and those with underlying chronic diseases. knowledge of pathogens causing cap constitutes  the basis for selection of antimicrobial treatment. previous data have shown that etiological agents can be identified in only up to 50% of patients, but this figure can be improved by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). this study was designed to evaluate multiplex real-time pcr as a method for rapid differential detection of five bacterial causes of cap (streptococcus pneumoniae, burkholderia pseudomallei and atypical bacterial pathogens namely mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila) in cap patients attending hospital tengku ampuan afzan (htaa)/ kuantan, pahang, malaysia. two previously developed multiplex real-time pcr assays, duplex for the differential detection of s. pneumoniae and b. pseudomallei and triplex for the atypical bacterial pathogens, were used to detect a bacterial cause of cap in blood and respiratory  samples. thus, 46 blood and 45 respiratory samples collected from 46 adult cap patients admitted to htaa were analysed by multiplex real-time pcr assays and conventional methods. the microbial etiology of cap could be established for 39.1% (18/46) of cap patients by conventional methods and this was increased to 65.2% (30/46) with the additional use of real-time pcr. the most frequently detected pathogens were s. pneumoniae (21.7% - all by pcr alone), klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%), b. pseudomallei (13% - 83% of them positive by pcr alone and  17% by both culture and pcr), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.5%), m. pneumoniae (6.5%  - all by serology), c. pneumoniae (4.3% - all positive by both pcr and serology), l. pneumophila (2.1% - all by pcr alone), escherichia coli (4.3%). haemophilus infuenzae, acinetobacter lwoffii and acinetobacter baumannii were detected by conventional methods (2.1% for each).

TI  == transmission of carbapenem-resistant pathogens in new york city hospitals: progress and frustration.
AB  == objectives: carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa are endemic in many medical centres. because therapeutic options are limited, understanding the epidemiology and controlling the spread of these pathogens are of paramount importance. methods: isolates of k. pneumoniae, a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were collected from 14 hospitals in new york city over a 3 month period in 2009, and analysed for the presence of genes encoding important carbapenemases. comparisons were made with a similar study conducted in 2006. demographic and infection control-related information from hospitals was collected. results: overall, 29% of k. pneumoniae possessed the carbapenemase kpc, significantly improved from the 38% observed in 2006 (p <  0.001). however, carbapenem resistance worsened in a. baumannii (mostly due to the emergence of strains with oxa-type carbapenemases) and p. aeruginosa. the decline in kpc-possessing k. pneumoniae was not uniformly observed in all of the  hospitals. in a subset analysis of nine hospitals, those with a decreasing prevalence of bla(kpc) had shorter average lengths of stay. conclusions: measurable improvement has occurred in reducing the spread of kpc-possessing k. pneumoniae, and reducing the average length of stay may augment infection control efforts. however, the problem of carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa lingers. new approaches, including respiratory isolation and environmental cleaning, need to be examined to control the spread of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by eskape organisms: cause, clinical features, and management.
AB  == purpose of review: despite important geographical variations, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter species (eskape) pathogens constitute more than 80% of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) episodes. their clinical importance relies on their virulence and ability in developing mechanisms to decrease susceptibility to antimicrobials, increasing inappropriate therapy and affecting negatively on icu patients' outcome. this review updates information on vap due to eskape pathogens. recent findings: although methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus vap may be clinically similar to that caused by susceptible strains, it is associated with poorer outcomes despite adequate treatment. local  colonization determines treatment options. the contribution of tracheobronchitis  is an important issue. minimum inhibitory concentration should be considered for  nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria vap to prescribe extended infusion beta-lactam treatment due to an increase of resistant strains. strategies promoting antimicrobial diversity may protect against emergence and spread of resistance by eskape pathogens. summary: vap due to eskape pathogens represents a global challenge that can be prevented using stewardship programmes promoting diversity.

TI  == [investigation and analysis of nosocomial infection in neonates].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence of nosocomial infections of newborn infants in neonates and to explore the risk factors and strategies of infection control. methods: there were 433 confirmed cases of nosocomial infection in the neonatal ward of the authors' hospital from january 2007 to december 2009. their  data of epidemiological and clinical characteristics, results of etiological examinations and antibiotic resistance were retrospectively analyzed. results: during the study, the number of hospitalizations were 6437. nosocomial infection  occurred in 433 patients 513 times. the overall nosocomial infection rate was 6.82%. the overall hospitalization days were 73 663 and nosocomial infection patient-day rates were 6.96 per thousand. the vap infection rate was 28.7 per thousand. the crbsi rate was 3.5 per thousand. gestational age (or = 1.049), mechanical ventilation (or = 1.810), umbilical vein catheter (or = 1.106), hospitalization days (or = 1.081), premature rupture of membrane (or = 1.433) were the risk factors for the development of nosocomial infection. there were 197 (38.4%) cases of pneumonia, which was the most common nosocomial infection in neonatal ward. there were 129 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap), which accounts for 65.5% of pneumonia and 24.4% of cases treated with ventilator. the next was sepsis, 124 cases (24.2%) and 64 cases of diarrheal disease (12.7%). one hundred and eighty two (54.4%) strains of isolates were gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. the predominant pathogens of gram-negative bacteria were klebsiella pneumoniae (19.6%), followed by acinetobacter baumannii (8.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.2%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.8%) and escherichia coli (4.8%). the isolation rates of klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were 91.4% and 75%, respectively. those two bacteria were universally resistant to cephalosporins. the rate of resistance to imipenem of klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa were 1.5%, 11.1% and 41.7%. the isolation rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus were 28.6% and 95.5%. conclusion: it is important to identify the high risk factors for nosocomial infections in newborn infants. to shorten time for mechanical ventilation and hospitalization days, removal of the central venous catheter as early as possible would be conducive to reducing the morbidity of nosocomial infection. the main pathogens were gram-negative bacteria. the multidrug resistance of enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters is serious.

TI  == [clinical observation of therapeutic effect of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome].
AB  == objective: to investigate the therapeutic effects and safety of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome  (ards). methods: ecmo were initiated in 6 patients with ards, not responding to conventional mechanical ventilation. oxygenation status, positive end-expiratory  pressure (peep) level, and fraction of inspired oxygen [fio(2)] were compared before and after treatment with ecmo, while the adverse effects of ecmo were recorded. results: in 6 cases, pulse blood oxygen saturation [spo(2)] was elevated (0.45-0.92 up to 0.94-1.00), peep level [cm h(2)o, 1 cm h(2)o=0.098 kpa] and [fio(2)] were lowered [peep: 10.0-22.0 down to 4.0-15.0; fio(2): 1.00 down to 0.30-0.60] after treatment with ecmo. of 6 cases, 2 patients with severe influenza a/h1n1 pneumonia finally died of shock; 1 patient with severe influenza a/h1n1 pneumonia and 1 patient with klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia were withdrawn from ecmo treatment because of deterioration of the disease. one patient suffering from cytomegalovirus pneumonia and another with acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia were successfully discharged from hospital with recovery. the main complications were bleeding and hemolysis. conclusions: ecmo could improve gas exchange, oxygenation and partially replace pulmonary function. patients with ards should be treated with ecmo early if artificial ventilation treatment was unresponsive.

TI  == garlic ointment inhibits biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens from burn wounds.
AB  == when thermal injury damages the skin, the physical barrier protecting underlying  tissues from invading micro-organisms is compromised and the host's immune system becomes supressed, facilitating colonization and infection of burn wounds with micro-organisms. within the wound, bacteria often develop biofilms, which protect the bacteria from the immune response and enhance their resistance to antibiotics. as the prophylactic use of conventional antibiotics drives selection of drug-resistant strains, the use of novel agents to prevent biofilm formation by wound pathogens is essential. in the present study, we utilized our recently developed in vitro wound biofilm model to examine the antibiofilm activity of garlic (allium sativum). wound pathogens were inoculated on sterile cellulose discs, exposed to formulated garlic ointment (garo) or ointment base, and incubated to allow biofilm development. biofilms were quantified and visualized microscopically. garo prevented biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae, and caused a 2-5 log reduction of the bioburden within enterococcus faecalis biofilms. additionally, garo disrupted partially developed  biofilms produced by s. aureus, s. epidermidis and a. baumannii. the antistaphylococcal activity of garo was stable for over 3 months at room temperature. thus, garo could be used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent wound  biofilms caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from forming, and may be a potential therapy for disrupting established staphylococcal biofilms.

TI  == efficacy of ertapenem for treatment of bloodstream infections caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == ertapenem is active against extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae organisms but inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. due to a lack of therapeutic data for ertapenem in the treatment of esbl bloodstream infections (bsis), group 2 carbapenems (e.g., imipenem or meropenem) are often preferred for treatment of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae, although their antipseudomonal activity is unnecessary. from  2005 to 2010, 261 patients with esbl bsis were analyzed. outcomes were equivalent between patients treated with ertapenem and those treated with group 2 carbapenems (mortality rates of 6% and 18%, respectively; p = 0.18).

TI  == assessing the pharmacodynamic profile of intravenous antibiotics against prevalent gram-negative organisms collected in colombia.
AB  == objectives: this study was designed to simulate standard and optimized dosing regimens for intravenous antibiotics against contemporary populations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa using mic distribution data to determine which of the tested carbapenem regimens provided the greatest opportunity for obtaining maximal pharmacodynamic (pd) activity. methods: the isolates studied were obtained from the compact-colombia surveillance program conducted between february and november 2009. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted by broth microdilution method according to the clsi guidelines. doripenem, imipenem-cilastatin, and meropenem, were the modeled antibiotics. a 5,000 patient monte carlo simulation was performed for each regimen and pd targets were defined as free drug concentrations above the mic for at least 40% of the dosing interval. results: all carbapenem regimens obtained optimal exposures against e. coli, unlike the other enterobacteriaceae tested. against p. aeruginosa, only a prolonged infusion of doripenem exceeded the 90% cumulative fraction of response (cfr) threshold. worrisomely, no regimens for any of the drugs tested obtained optimal cfr against a. baumannii. for p. aeruginosa intensive care unit (icu) isolates, cfr was approximately 20% lower for isolates collected in the respiratory tract compared  with bloodstream or intra-abdominal for imipenem and meropenem. noteworthy, all doripenem and meropenem regimens achieved greater than 90% cfr against bloodstream and respiratory isolates of k. pneumoniae. conclusions: our data suggests that higher dosing and prolonged infusion of doripenem or meropenem may  be suitable for empirically treating icu p. aeruginosa, while none of the carbapenems achieved optimal cumulative fraction of response against a. baumannii. standard dosing regimens of all the carbapenems tested achieved optimal cfr against e. coli isolates, but higher carbapenem dosages might be required for empiric treatment of k. pneumoniae, particularly from an intra-abdominal source. non-standard dosage regimens studied in this modeling should be proven effective in prospective clinical trials.

TI  == trends in the susceptibility of clinically important resistant bacteria to tigecycline: results from the tigecycline in vitro surveillance in taiwan study,  2006 to 2010.
AB  == the tigecycline in vitro surveillance in taiwan (tist) study, a nationwide, prospective surveillance during 2006 to 2010, collected a total of 7,793 clinical isolates, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n = 1,834), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) (n = 423), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) (n = 219), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (n = 1,141), esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1,330), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1,645), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 903), from different specimens from 20 different hospitals in taiwan. mics of tigecycline were determined following the  criteria of the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast-2011). among drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens, all of the prsp isolates were susceptible to tigecycline (mic(90), 0.03 mug/ml), and only one mrsa isolate (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and three vre isolates (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml) were nonsusceptible to tigecycline. among the gram-negative bacteria, the tigecycline susceptibility rates were 99.65% for esbl-producing e. coli (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and 96.32% for esbl-producing k. pneumoniae (mic(90), 2 mug/ml) when interpreted by fda criteria but were 98.7% and 85.8%, respectively, when interpreted by eucast-2011 criteria. the susceptibility rate for a. baumannii (mic(90), 4 mug/ml) decreased from 80.9% in 2006 to 55.3% in 2009 but increased to 73.4% in 2010. a bimodal mic distribution was found among carbapenem-susceptible a. baumannii isolates, and a  unimodal mic distribution was found among carbapenem-nonsusceptible a. baumannii  isolates. in taiwan, tigecycline continues to have excellent in vitro activity against several major clinically important drug-resistant bacteria, with the exception of a. baumannii.

TI  == multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections after liver transplantation - spectrum and risk factors.
AB  == objectives: gram-negative bacilli infections, especially multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli infections, are the leading cause of high mortality after liver transplantation. this study sought to investigate the type of infection, infection rate, pathogenic spectrum, antibiotic-resistance profile, risk factors, and epidemiology of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infection. methods: a retrospective cohort study was conducted and data of 217 liver transplant patients receiving cadaveric livers between january 2007 and april 2010 were analyzed. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration test. extended-spectrum and metallo-beta-lactamase assays were used to analyze beta-lactamase-produced isolates, and repetitive-sequence polymerase chain reaction was used to differentiate bacterium subspecies. results: sixty-seven isolates of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 66 infected liver transplant patients. stenotrophomonas maltophilia (100%, 8/8), klebsiella pneumoniae (61.5%, 8/13), enterobacter cloacae (75%, 3/4) and escherichia coli (81.3%, 13/16) were the most common extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacilli. metallo-beta-lactamase expressing isolates were identified as s. maltophilia (100%, 8/8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (83.3%, 5/6), acinetobacter baumannii (95%, 19/20). significant independent risk factors for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infection were extended use of pre-transplant broad-spectrum antibiotics (or 9.027, p=0.001) and prolonged (>=72h) endotracheal intubation (or 3.537, p=0.033). conclusions: to reduce the risk of acquiring mdr gram-negative bacillus infections after liver transplant, control measures are required to limit the use of prophylactic antibiotic in preventing infection during liver transplant and to shorten endotracheal intubation time.

TI  == activity of polymyxin b and the novel polymyxin analogue cb-182,804 against contemporary gram-negative pathogens in new york city.
AB  == multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa have become common in many regions, often requiring therapy with colistin or polymyxin b. an increase in resistance to these agents would render many infections untreatable. we tested the activity of polymyxin b and the novel polymyxin analogue cb-182,804 against over 5,000 recent gram-negative clinical isolates from new york city, a region with a high prevalence of multiresistant strains. over 96% of escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, a. baumannii, and p. aeruginosa were susceptible to polymyxin b; only 76% of enterobacter spp. was susceptible. the mics of cb-182,804 were generally two-fold higher than polymyxin b and cross-resistance was observed. the addition  of rifampin resulted in synergistic inhibition and bactericidal activity in time  kill studies, and restored activity against all polymyxin-resistant strains. the  synergistic effect of the combination with rifampin was most pronounced against a. baumannii strains, and was slightly greater with cb-182,804 than with polymyxin b against k. pneumoniae and enterobacter spp. despite considerable usage of polymyxin b and colistin in this region, polymyxin b retains excellent activity against most gram-negative isolates. cb-182,804 shows similar activity,  particularly when combined with rifampin. the clinical utility of cb-182,804 remains to be determined.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

TI  == identification of new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase gene (ndm-1) from a clinical isolate of acinetobacter junii in china.
AB  == new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) is a novel type of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) responsible for bacterial resistance to beta-lactam  antibiotics. acinetobacter junii was previously shown to possess a mbl phenotype; however, the genes responsible for this phenotype were not identified. in this study, we reported the identification of ndm-1 gene in a clinical isolate of a. junii from a child patient in china, which was resistant to all beta-lactams except aztreonam but sensitive to aminoglycosides and quinolones. the cloned ndm-1 gene contained an open reading frame of 813 bp and had a nucleotide sequence 99.9% identical (812/813) to reported ndm-1 genes carried by acinetobacter baumannii , enterococcus faecium , escherichia coli , and klebsiella pneumoniae . recombinant ndm-1 protein was successfully expressed in e. coli bl21, and antibiotic sensitivities of the ndm-1-producing e. coli were largely similar to the a. junii 1454 isolate. the findings of this study raise attention to the emergence and spread of ndm-1-carrying bacteria in china.

AB  == the latest threat of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria corresponds to the emergence of carbapenemase ndm-1 (new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase) producers, mostly in enterobacteriacae. five bla(ndm) (-1) -positive plasmids of  different incompatibility groups (incl/m, fii, a/c and two untypeable plasmids) from clinical enterobacteriaceae were evaluated for conjugation properties and host specificity. successful conjugative transfers were obtained using all tested enterobacterial species as recipients (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium and proteus mirabilis) and all plasmid types. conjugation  frequencies varied from 1 x 10(-4) to 6 x 10(-8) transconjugants per donor. higher conjugation rates were obtained for two plasmids at 30 degrees c compared  with that observed at 25 and 37 degrees c. carbapenems used as selector did not lead to higher conjugation frequencies. none of the five plasmids was transferable to acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa by conjugation. this work underlines how efficient the spread of the carbapenemase bla(ndm) (-1)  gene could be among enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == evolution to carbapenem-hydrolyzing activity in noncarbapenemase class d beta-lactamase oxa-10 by rational protein design.
AB  == class d beta-lactamases with carbapenemase activity are emerging as carbapenem-resistance determinants in gram-negative bacterial pathogens, mostly acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae. carbapenemase activity is an unusual feature among class d beta-lactamases, and the structural elements responsible for this activity remain unclear. based on structural and molecular dynamics data, we previously hypothesized a potential role of the residues located in the short-loop connecting strands beta5 and beta6 (the beta5-beta6 loop) in conferring the carbapenemase activity of the oxa-48 enzyme. in this work, the narrow-spectrum oxa-10 class d beta-lactamase, which is unable to hydrolyze carbapenems, was used as a model to investigate the possibility of evolving carbapenemase activity by replacement of the beta5-beta6 loop with those present in three different lineages of class d carbapenemases (oxa-23, oxa-24, and oxa-48). biological assays and kinetic measurements showed that all three oxa-10-derived hybrids acquired significant carbapenemase activity. structural analysis of the oxa-10loop24 and oxa-10loop48 hybrids revealed no significant changes in the molecular fold of the enzyme, except for the orientation of the substituted beta5-beta6 loops, which was reminiscent of that found in their parental enzymes. these results demonstrate the crucial role of the beta5-beta6 loop in the carbapenemase activity of class d beta-lactamases, and provide previously unexplored insights into the mechanism by which these enzymes can evolve carbapenemase activity.

AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of avibactam (formerly nxl104) in combination with imipenem, cefepime or ceftazidime against gram-negative bacteria. bacterial isolates included: pseudomonas aeruginosa harbouring per-1 beta-lactamase (n=14); acinetobacter baumannii harbouring per-1, oxa-51 and oxa-58 (n=20); carbapenem-non-susceptible  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and escherichia coli (n=1) harbouring oxa-48; carbapenem-non-susceptible e. coli (n=1) harbouring both imp-1 metallo-beta-lactamase and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl); carbapenem-non-susceptible serratia marcescens (n=1); and carbapenem-susceptible  e. coli (n=20) and k. pneumoniae isolates (n=12) with ctx-m-15 esbl. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime were determined in combination with 4 mg/l avibactam by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) method on mueller-hinton agar. imipenem/avibactam and  ceftazidime/avibactam displayed limited potency against a. baumannii isolates, whereas cefepime/avibactam and ceftazidime/avibactam were active against p. aeruginosa. klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with oxa-48 beta-lactamase were resistant to imipenem [mic for 90% of the organisms (mic(90)) >/=4 mg/l]. mic(90) values for the combination of avibactam 4 mg/l with imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime were in the susceptible range for all strains (mic(90)</=0.5mg/l). all e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates with ctx-m-15 beta-lactamase were inhibited at </=1 mg/l for combinations with avibactam and 100% were susceptible  by clsi breakpoint criteria to imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime. in conclusion, combinations of imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime with avibactam may present a promising therapeutic strategy to treat infections due to k. pneumoniae with oxa-48 enzyme as well as k. pneumoniae and e. coli with ctx-m-15 enzyme.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance pattern for gram-negative uropathogens isolated from hospitalised patients and outpatients in cartagena, 2005-2008].
AB  == objective: determining the microbial aetiology spectrum and antibiotic resistance pattern of uropathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitalised patients and outpatients. methods: a descriptive study was carried out between february 2005 and november 2008 at the san buenaventura university's clinical laboratory in cartagena. antibiotic sensitivity was determined by the kirby bauer method. results: out of the total specimens (1,384) analysed over the four-year study period, 455 of the urine samples (32.9 %) were culture positive, most (81.4 %) having come from females. the bacterium isolated most frequently was escherichia  coli (60.1 %) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (6.9 %), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.6 %), proteus mirabilis (5.4 %) and acinetobacter baumannii (1.4 %). the gram-negative isolates displayed a high level of resistance to ampicillin (range  84.3100 %), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (range 66.580 %) and ciprofloxacin (range 4057.9 %). conclusion: gram-negative bacteria were responsible for urinary tract  infections in the patients involved in this study. the most commonly isolated bacteria were e. coli. empirical administration of a third-generation cephalosporin for initial treatment of urinary tract infections in this population appears prudent from the perspective of antimicrobial susceptibility.

TI  == clinical predictors of pseudomonas aeruginosa or acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia in patients admitted to the ed.
AB  == the identification of clinical characteristics that could identify patients at high risk for pseudomonas aeruginosa or acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia would  aid clinicians in the appropriate management of these life-threatening conditions, especially in patients admitted to the emergency department (ed) with community-onset infections. to determine clinical risk factors for p. aeruginosa  or a. baumannii bacteremia in patients with community-onset gram-negative bacteremia (gnb), a post hoc analysis of a nationwide bacteremia surveillance database including patients with microbiologically documented gnb was performed.  ninety-six patients with p. aeruginosa or a. baumannii bacteremia were compared with 1230 patients with escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia. a solid tumor or hematologic malignancy was more likely to be associated with p. aeruginosa or a. baumannii bacteremia, whereas concurrent neurologic disease was  less frequently seen. in regards to the site of infection, pneumonia was more common in p. aeruginosa or a. baumannii bacteremia, whereas a urinary tract infection was less frequently seen. factors associated with p. aeruginosa or a. baumannii bacteremia in multivariate analysis included pneumonia (odds ratio [or], 3.60; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.86-6.99), hematologic malignancy (or, 2.71; 95% ci, 1.26-5.84), male sex (or, 2.17; 95% ci, 1.31-3.58), solid tumor (or, 1.89; 95% ci, 1.15-3.12), and health-care-associated infection (or, 1.88; 95% ci, 1.48-2.41). our data suggest that an initial empirical antimicrobial coverage of p. aeruginosa or a. baumannii bacteremia should be seriously considered in patients with pneumonia, a hematologic malignancy, solid tumor, or  health-care-associated infection, when gnb is suspected, even in community-onset  infections.

TI  == [in vitro evaluation of bactericidal activity of an over-heated saturated dry atomized steam electro-medical device on inert contaminated surfaces].
AB  == surface disinfection together with cleaning practises and aseptic procedures are  established measures for effective prevention of infectious diseases reducing infection risks. in this study, we evaluated the bactericidal effectiveness in vitro of the electro-medical device sani system, an over-heated saturated dry-steam disinfection system, against predetermined bacterial load dried on inert surfaces. in particular we have tested different materials, representative  of operating rooms furnishing and walls commonly used in healthcare setting, with staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii. as a result of treatment, the mean bacterial load on all the test surfaces was reduced by a factor of 102 in the contact plate experimental study and by a factor of 10 in the total bioburden experimental study. the sani system polti proved to be efficacious in killing 100% of the bacteria in all experimental conditions, therefore it could help to reduce the risk of spreading nosocomial infections in healthcare facilities.

TI  == efficacy and toxicity of the antimicrobial peptide m33 produced with different counter-ions.
AB  == the tetra-branched peptide m33 (pini et al. in faseb j 24:1015-1022, 2010) is under evaluation in animal models for its activity as antimicrobial agent in lung infections and sepsis. the preclinical development of a new drug requires medium-scale manufacture for tests of efficacy, biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and toxicity. in order to produce the most suitable peptide form for these purposes, we evaluated the behaviour of the peptide m33 obtained with different counter-ions. we compared activity and toxicity in vitro and in vivo of the peptide m33 produced as trifluoroacetate salt (tfacetate) and as acetate salt. the two forms did not differ substantially in terms of efficacy in vitro or in vivo but showed different toxicities for human cells and in animals. m33-tfacetate proved to be 5-30% more toxic than m33-acetate for cells derived from normal bronchi and cells carrying deltaf508 mutation in the cftr gene, the most frequent variant in cystic fibrosis. m33-tfacetate produced manifest signs of in vivo toxicity immediately after administration, whereas m33-acetate only generated mild signs, which disappeared within a few hours. the peptide m33-acetate proved more suitable for the development of a new drug, and was therefore chosen for further characterization.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial studies of silver carbene complexes: activity of free and  nanoparticle carbene formulations against clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == objectives: silver carbenes may represent novel, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that have low toxicity while providing varying chemistry for targeted applications. here, the bactericidal activity of four silver carbene complexes (sccs) with different formulations, including nanoparticles (nps) and micelles, was tested against a panel of clinical strains of bacteria and fungi that are the causative agents of many skin and soft tissue, respiratory, wound, blood, and nosocomial infections. methods: mic, mbc and multidose experiments were conducted against a broad range of bacteria and fungi. time-release and cytotoxicity studies of the compounds were also carried out. free sccs and scc nps were tested against a panel of medically important pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (mrab), pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia and klebsiella pneumoniae. results:  all four sccs demonstrated strong efficacy in concentration ranges of 0.5-90 mg/l. clinical bacterial isolates with high inherent resistance to purified compounds were more effectively treated either with an np formulation of these compounds or by repeated dosing. overall, the compounds were active against highly resistant bacterial strains, such as mrsa and mrab, and were active against the biodefence pathogens bacillus anthracis and yersinia pestis. all of the medically important bacterial strains tested play a role in many different infectious diseases. conclusions: the four sccs described here, including their development as np therapies, show great promise for treating a wide variety of bacterial and fungal pathogens that are not easily killed by routine antimicrobial agents.

TI  == pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of tigecycline.
AB  == introduction: as the spread of multidrug-resistant (mdr) and extensive drug-resistant (xdr) organisms constitutes a real threat for patients, new antimicrobials are needed. tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, possesses an extended spectrum of antimicrobial activity including mdr and xdr organisms, which holds promise as a treatment option beyond currently approved indications and deserves expanded evaluation of its pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (pk/pd). areas covered: this review highlights  the areas where our knowledge on pk/pd of tigecycline has been both strengthened  and questioned during the recent years. new information has become available on the pk of tigecycline in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infection, community- and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia. human pd data from clinical trials linking tigecycline drug exposure to clinical, microbiological and toxicological outcomes are also of great interest. expert opinion: tigecycline remains one of our last resorts against mdr pathogens; its clear role has to be re-defined through intense pk/pd applications; dose escalation and exploration of combinations with  other antibiotics seem to be the first step towards an expansion of its currently approved indications. the lung remains the most controversial and challenging site regarding the pk/pd standpoint due to the predominance of acinetobacter baumannii and carbapenemase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae among ventilator-associated pneumonia infections, for which tigecycline is mostly used  off-label.

TI  == ancient antimicrobial peptides kill antibiotic-resistant pathogens: australian mammals provide new options.
AB  == background: to overcome the increasing resistance of pathogens to existing antibiotics the 10x'20 initiative declared the urgent need for a global commitment to develop 10 new antimicrobial drugs by the year 2020. naturally occurring animal antibiotics are an obvious place to start. the recently sequenced genomes of mammals that are divergent from human and mouse, including the tammar wallaby and the platypus, provide an opportunity to discover novel antimicrobials. marsupials and monotremes are ideal potential sources of new antimicrobials because they give birth to underdeveloped immunologically naive young that develop outside the sterile confines of a uterus in harsh pathogen-laden environments. while their adaptive immune system develops innate immune factors produced either by the mother or by the young must play a key role in protecting the immune-compromised young. in this study we focus on the cathelicidins, a key family of antimicrobial peptide genes. principal finding: we identified 14 cathelicidin genes in the tammar wallaby genome and 8 in the platypus genome. the tammar genes were expressed in the mammary gland during early lactation before the adaptive immune system of the young develops, as well  as in the skin of the pouch young. both platypus and tammar peptides were effective in killing a broad range of bacterial pathogens. one potent peptide, expressed in the early stages of tammar lactation, effectively killed multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii. conclusions and significance: marsupial and monotreme young are protected by antimicrobial peptides that are potent, broad spectrum and salt resistant. the genomes of our distant relatives may hold  the key for the development of novel drugs to combat multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == colistin: recent data on pharmacodynamics properties and clinical efficacy in critically ill patients.
AB  == recent clinical studies performed in a large number of patients showed that colistin "forgotten" for several decades revived for the management of infections due to multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacteria (gnb) and had acceptable  effectiveness and considerably less toxicity than that reported in older publications. colistin is a rapidly bactericidal antimicrobial agent that possesses a significant postantibiotic effect against mdr gram-negative pathogens, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the optimal colistin dosing regimen against mdr gnb is still unknown in the intensive care unit (icu) setting. a better understanding of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of colistin is urgently needed to determine the optimal dosing regimen. although pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in icu patients are scarce, recent evidence shows that the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of colistimethate sodium and colistin in critically ill patients differ from those previously found in other groups, such  as cystic fibrosis patients. the auc:mic ratio has been found to be the parameter best associated with colistin efficacy. to maximize the auc:mic ratio, higher doses of colistimethate sodium and alterations in the dosing intervals may be warranted in the icu setting. in addition, the development of colistin resistance has been linked to inadequate colistin dosing. this enforces the importance of colistin dose optimization in critically ill patients. although higher colistin doses seem to be beneficial, the lack of colistin pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic data results in difficulty for the optimization of daily colistin dose. in conclusion, although colistin seems to be a very reliable alternative for the management of life-threatening nosocomial infections due to mdr gnb, it should be emphasized that there is a lack of guidelines regarding the ideal management of these infections and the appropriate colistin doses in critically ill patients with and without multiple organ failure.

AB  == the emergence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, in particular pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae, has necessitated the search for alternative therapy by either introducing new agents or renewing interest in old agents. this study compares the in vitro activity of tigecycline (tig), recently introduced to egyptian market, to other potentially active antimicrobials as colistin (col), imipenem (ipm), levofloxacin (lev), and piperacillin/tazobactam (pip/taz) against 67 gram-negative clinical isolates obtained from el- meery hospital in alexandria, egypt. el-meery hospital is a 1,500-bed tertiary teaching hospital where tig has  not been previously used. based on mic(90)s, tig was found to be a comparator to  ipm and col (mic(90)= 8 mug/ml). lev and pip/taz were less active than tig exhibiting high mic(90)s. tig inhibited 100% of escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae and 60% of ps. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates. in time-kill studies against ipm-resistant isolates, tig showed bactericidal activity after 6  hours of contact against the enterobacteriaceae isolates and after 3 hours for the tested ps. aeruginosa isolates at 4x and 8x mic. against a. baumannii, tig exerted a bacteriostatic effect. tig demonstrated variable ability to suppress biofilm formation affecting mainly e. coli and a. baumannii isolates. these results point tig to be a promising agent in treatment of infections caused by strains for which adequate therapy has been limited. as far as we know, this is the first report evaluating the in vitro activity of tig against egyptian clinical isolates.

TI  == development of taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction for the detection of the newly emerging form of carbapenem resistance gene in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == purpose: the newly emerging form of the so-called new delhi metallo-beta-lactamases (ndm-1) has been reported recently from patients worldwide and broadly thought as a potential source for the major global health problem. thus, it is important to study the epidemiology of the so-called ndm-1 harbouring bacteria to prevent its further spread and to place effective control  measures. the present study describes the use of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay for the detection of the bla ndm-1 gene using taqman probes  among clinical isolates. materials and methods: clinical isolates of escherichia  coli (11 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (17 strains) and acinetobacter baumannii (six strains) that were resistant to either of the carbapenems (meropenem or imipenem) were included in the study. the presence of carbapenemases in such strains was confirmed using the modified hodge test. a real-time pcr assay was optimized for the detection of ndm-1 using a cloned synthetic gene fragment followed by testing of the clinical isolates. the findings were further confirmed using pcr and gene sequencing. results: taqman probe assay displayed a good detection limit with analytical sensitivity of the assay up to 10 copies of bla ndm-1 gene per reaction. the isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae revealed narrow range crossing point values (cp values) between (12-17) cycles (mean cp value 14), indicating number of bla ndm-1 gene copies of 106-108. the wider range of cp values (15-34) cycles with a higher mean cp value (23.6) was observed in a. baumannii with number of bla ndm-1 gene copies of 103-108. conclusions: the study demonstrates that real-time pcr assay based on taqman chemistry is a useful technique for the detection of bla ndm-1 harbouring clinical isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae and a. baumannii. the assay has great precision in measuring the number of bla ndm-1 gene copies per specimen of dna.

TI  == polymyxins: antimicrobial susceptibility concerns and therapeutic options.
AB  == the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens such as acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae poses a great challenge to the treating physicians. the paucity of newer effective antimicrobials has led to renewed interest in the polymyxin group of drugs, as a  last resort for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections. there is a dearth of information on the pharmacological properties of colistin, leading to difficulties in selecting the right dose, dosing interval, and route of administration for treatment, especially in critically-ill patients. the increasing use of colistin over the last few years necessitates the need for accurate and reliable in vitro susceptibility testing methods. development of heteroresistant strains as a result of colistin monotherapy is also a growing concern. there is a compelling need from the clinicians to provide options for probable and possible colistin combination therapy for multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in the icu setting. newer combination drug synergy determination tests are being developed and reported. there are no standardized recommendations from antimicrobial susceptibility testing reference agencies for  the testing and interpretation of these drug combinations. comparison and analysis of these reported methodologies may help to understand and assist the microbiologist to choose the best method that produces accurate results at the earliest. this will help clinicians to select the appropriate combination therapy. in this era of multidrug resistance it is important for the microbiology laboratory to be prepared, by default, to provide timely synergistic susceptibility results in addition to routine susceptibility, if warranted. not as a favour or at request, but as a responsibility.

TI  == controlled performance evaluation of the diversilab repetitive-sequence-based genotyping system for typing multidrug-resistant health care-associated bacterial pathogens.
AB  == fast, reliable, and versatile typing tools are essential to differentiate among related bacterial strains for epidemiological investigation and surveillance of health care-associated infection with multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens. the diversilab (dl) system is a semiautomated repetitive-sequence-based pcr system designed for rapid genotyping. the dl system performance was assessed by comparing its reproducibility, typeability, discriminatory power, and concordance with those of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and multilocus sequence typing (mlst) and by assessing its epidemiological concordance on well-characterized mdr bacterial strains (n = 165). these included vana enterococcus faecium, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii, and esbl- or metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. the dl system showed very good performance for e. faecium and k. pneumoniae and good performance for other species, except for a discrimination index of <95% for a. baumannii and e. coli (93.9% and 93.5%, respectively) and incomplete concordance with mlst for p. aeruginosa (78.6%) and e. coli (97.0%). occasional violations of mlst assignment by dl types were noted for e. coli. complete epidemiological concordance was observed for all pathogens, as all outbreak-associated strains clustered in identical dl types that were distinct from those of unrelated strains. in conclusion, the dl system showed good to excellent performance, making it a reliable typing tool for investigation of outbreaks caused by study pathogens, even though it was generally less discriminating than pfge analysis. for e. coli and p. aeruginosa, mlst cannot be  reliably inferred from dl type due to phylogenetic group violation or discordance.

TI  == [common antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in nosocomial infections in taiwan and their prevention].
AB  == infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant strains (mdr) that cause difficulties in clinical treatment,  have long been a problem of global concern. drug-resistant strains of common nosocomial infections in taiwan include gram-positive coccal methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and gram-negative bacilli such as carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, among others. about 10 to 20% of gram-negative bacteria that encode extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are resistant to cephalosporin, a third generation antibiotic, and the fluoroquinolone-resistance rate has continued to increase in recent years. despite the high mortality rate in patients with infections caused by mdr, the problem is still solvable by blocking or reducing mdr dissemination in addition to proper antibiotics use. hand hygiene is the simplest, most effective measure for preventing nosocomial infections. however, healthcare workers' adherence to recommended hand hygiene practices is unacceptably low worldwide, making the promotion of hand hygiene a major challenge for infection control experts. therefore, as a first step of preventing the spread of mdr bacteria, knowledge of hand hygiene and adherence to hand hygiene practices must be required of healthcare workers. such should help reduce nosocomial infections significantly and upgrade healthcare quality.

TI  == dna capturing machinery through spore-displayed proteins.
AB  == aims: the purpose of this study was to develop a general method for the facile development of a new dna biosensor which utilizes streptavidin-displayed spores as a molecular machinery. methods and results: fluorescence spectroscopy was used as a monitoring tool for the streptavidin displayed on the surface of bacillus thuringiensis spores and as a diagnosis method for dna detection. as a proof-of-concept, four pathogenic bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumonia were used for  the detection of pathogenic species. in addition, a set of mutant variants of wilson's disease were also used for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) in this system. conclusions: this strategy, utilizing streptavidin-displayed spores, is capable of capturing dna targets for the detection of pathogenic bacteria and for mutation analysis in wilson's disease. significance and impact of the study: this approach could be useful as a simple platform for developing sensitive spore-based biosensors for any desired dna targets in diagnostic applications.

TI  == longitudinal survey of carbapenem resistance and resistance mechanisms in enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters from the usa in 2007-09.
AB  == background: antibiotic resistance is problematic in enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii, and is often associated with  serious infections. carbapenems are often one of the few remaining therapeutic options, so it is important to monitor carbapenem activity against these pathogens and to identify resistance mechanisms. methods: carbapenem susceptibilities were determined for 14 359 enterobacteriaceae, 3614 p. aeruginosa and 994 a. baumannii from the usa (2007-09). klebsiella pneumoniae with doripenem mics >/=2 mg/l (n = 88), and p. aeruginosa (n = 452), a. baumannii (n = 349) and other enterics (n = 13) with doripenem mics >/=4 mg/l were screened for carbapenem resistance mechanisms. results: doripenem/meropenem and imipenem susceptibilities for enterobacteriaceae were >99% and 89%, respectively. doripenem susceptibility (2007-09) for p. aeruginosa was 87.4%-84.1%; comparable  to meropenem and higher than imipenem. for a. baumannii, doripenem susceptibility (2007-09) was 63%-58.2%; lower than imipenem and meropenem. resistant k. pneumoniae had kpc and lacked porins ompk35/ompk36. in 2009, 3.4% of all k. pneumoniae possessed kpc. five other enterics and one p. aeruginosa possessed kpc. resistance mechanisms in p. aeruginosa were loss of porin oprd (90%), efflux (55%) and elevated ampc activity (25%). acquired carbapenemases oxa-23/-24 were present in 48% of resistant a. baumannii. vim metallo-beta-lactamases were present in three p. aeruginosa and one a. baumannii isolates. conclusions: doripenem and meropenem were more active than imipenem against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa from the usa. carbapenem resistance mechanisms included serine  carbapenemases, elevated ampc activity, efflux and porin deficiencies occurring mostly in p. aeruginosa. metallo-beta-lactamases were found in <0.1% of isolates.

TI  == colonization of the gut with gram-negative bacilli, its association with neonatal sepsis and its clinical relevance in a developing country.
AB  == this study examined the pattern of colonization of the neonatal gut by aerobic gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and evaluated the association between gut colonization and sepsis in the developing world. this deserves attention because  of the high incidence of sepsis and the differences in hygienic environments in developing countries compared with the developed world. the study was carried out on neonates in a tertiary-care government hospital. serial gut samples were analysed (gastric aspirates and stool samples) for gnb. blood samples of cases showing clinical signs of sepsis were also analysed for septic screening and culture positivity. antibiograms, serotyping and pfge were carried out to evaluate the relatedness of the gut and blood isolates. a diverse array of gnb was isolated from the gut of the neonates, klebsiella pneumoniae being most common, followed by escherichia coli. the rate of isolation of gnb was consistently higher in stool samples compared with gastric aspirate samples. colonization was influenced by a stay in the neonatal intensive care unit and by  the prolonged use of a feeding tube. gnb were the cause of sepsis in the majority of cases, with k. pneumoniae being the most frequently isolated gnb from the blood. acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and burkholderia cepacia were the other gnb recovered from the blood of the neonates. neonates with gnb in the gut had a higher incidence of clinical sepsis than those without. in 50 % of cases, the genotypes of the organisms found in the blood were indistinguishable from their gut counterpart. these results show that the neonatal gut is colonized with a diverse array of gnb, and an association between gut colonization and neonatal sepsis was observed.

TI  == [evolution of susceptibility to antibiotics of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumanii, in a university hospital center of beirut between 2005 and 2009].
AB  == introduction: until recently, multiresistant bacteria were only limited to hospitals. however, they are now responsible for community acquired infections, affecting people who have had no contact with the hospital environment. several mechanisms are associated with these resistances. the production of betalactamases is however the predominant mechanism and especially the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases or esbl by strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, which mediate resistance to third generation cephalosporins and aztreonam (azt). the association of multiple mechanisms of resistance (efflux pumps, impermeability and enzymatic inactivation) generates multi resistant bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa mdr and klebsiella pneumoniae mdr. aim of the study: the aim of the study was to analyze retrospectively the susceptibility to antibiotics of strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and a. baumanii isolated from hospitalized and outpatients in a university hospital center of beirut over a period of five years from 2005 to 2009. materials and methods: bacterial strains were classified according to their origin (inpatients versus outpatients), their ability to produce or not esbls for e. coli and k. pneumonia and if they were mdr for p. aeruginosa and a. baumanii. antibiotics susceptibilities were retrieved from the  informatics database of the hospital. comparison of susceptibility percentages was done using a unilateral z-test on a computer program. results: in 2009, 2541  strains of e. coli were isolated, 773 of which or 30.4 % were esbl producers while 2031 strains were isolated in 2005, of which 361 or 17.8 % were esbl producers (p<0.001). we noticed a decrease in hospital strains susceptibility to  ceftazidime (caz) and azt, between 2005 and 2009 (p<0.001), and a decrease in community strains susceptibility to trimethoprime/sulfamethoxazole (sxt) between  2005 and 2009 (p=0.03). we noted however a significant decrease of esbl producing strains between 2007 and 2009: 33.4 % versus 30.4 % (p=0.03). among 560 strains of k. pneumoniae isolated in 2009, 178 strains or 31.8 % were esbl producers in comparison to 23.7 % of the strains isolated in 2005 (p=0.03). we also noticed a  decrease in hospital strains susceptibility to piperacilline-tazobactam (tzp), cefotaxime (ctx) and azt (p<0.001 p=0.03 and p=0.03 respectively) between 2006 and 2009, and a significant increase in esbl producing strains between 2008 et 2009 (p=0.0001). 26.5 % of p. aeruginosa strains isolated in 2009 were mdr bacteria with no significant change as compared to 26.6 % in 2005 (p=0.5). however, the percentage of mdr strains slightly decreased between 2008 and 2009 (p=0.047). the susceptibility of mdr strains to caz and imipenem (imp) decreased  between 2005 and 2009 (p<0.001 and p=0.003 respectively). as for a. baumanii, 77.7 % of strains were mdr in 2009 in comparison to 73.4 % in 2005 (p=0.24) with  a dramatic decrease of mdr strains susceptibility to imp from 92.3 % in 2006 to 30 % in 2009 (p<0.001). conclusion: despite restrictions on antibiotics prescriptions and isolation of patients harboring mdr bacteria or bacteria producing esbl, there has not been satisfactory reduction of multi resistant bacteria and efforts should be made to reduce these bugs from the hospital flora.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance of gram negative bacilli isolated from tertiary-care hospitals in colombia].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial resistance has been identified as one of the major public health problems worldwide. to facilitate its control, bacterial resistance levels must be monitored permanently by effective surveillance systems. objective: to describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns of gram negative bacilli in colombian hospitals over a 3-year period. materials and methods: this  descriptive study used the bacterial susceptibility profiles provided by 14 tertiary-care hospitals belonging to the colombian nosocomial resistance study group. the hospitals were located in 7 major cities in colombia, and provided records over the period january 2006 to december 2008. using whonet 5.4, the antimicrobial resistance patterns were described for the enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) and non-fermenters (pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii). comparisons  were made in the bacterial responses to selected antibiotics in samples from general wards and from adult intensive care units. results: the antimicrobial resistance frequencies of several enterobacteriaceae species showed a decreasing  trend. in contrast, p. aeruginosa was demonstrated to be a multidrug-resistance organism with increasing resistance frequencies. conclusions: these data emphasize the importance of surveillance programs in detecting presence of multidrug-resistant organisms. this information will aid the implementation of protocols aimed to strengthen the infection control strategies and antibiotic stewardship in each hospital.

TI  == evaluations of bacterial contaminated full thickness burn wound healing in sprague dawley rats treated with tualang honey.
AB  == aim: the effect of tualang honey on wound healing in bacterial contaminated full-thickness burn wounds was evaluated in 36 male sprague dawley rats. materials and methods: the rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 12/group). three full-thickness burn wounds were created on each rat. each group  of rats was inoculated with a different organism in the burn wounds: group a was  inoculated with pseudomonas aeruginosa, group b was inoculated with klebsiella pneumoniae and group c was inoculated with acinetobacter baumannii. one wound on  each rat was dressed with either tualang honey, chitosan gel or hydrofibre silver. each wound size was measured on day 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 of the study. results: the mean wound size of the tualang honey-treated wounds was not statistically different than that of the chitosan gel or hydrofibre silver-treated wounds when the wounds were compared throughout the entire experiment (p > 0.05). however, comparing the mean wound size on day 21 alone revealed that the tualang honey-treated wounds were smaller in comparison to that of the chitosan gel and hydrofibre silver-treated groups. conclusions: this study shows that topical application of tualang honey on burn wounds contaminated with  p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii gave the fastest rate of healing compared with other treatments.

TI  == cloning, expression, and enzymatic activity of acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae acetyl-coenzyme a carboxylases.
AB  == pathogenic gram-negative bacteria are a major public health concern because they  are causative agents of life-threatening hospital-acquired infections. due to the increasing rates of resistance to available antibiotics, there is an urgent need  to develop new drugs. acetyl-coenzyme a carboxylase (accase) is a promising target for the development of novel antibiotics. we describe here the expression, purification, and enzymatic activity of recombinant accases from two clinically relevant gram-negative pathogens, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae. recombinant accase subunits (accad, accb, and accc) were expressed and purified, and the holoenzymes were reconstituted. accase enzyme activity was  monitored by direct detection of malonyl-coenzyme a (malonyl-coa) formation by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms). steady-state kinetics  experiments showed similar k(cat) and k(m) values for both enzymes. in addition,  similar ic(50) values were observed for inhibition of both enzymes by a previously reported accase inhibitor. to provide a higher throughput assay suitable for inhibitor screening, we developed and validated a luminescence-based accase assay that monitors atp depletion. finally, we established an enzyme activity assay for the isolated accad (carboxyltransferase) subunit, which is useful for determining whether novel accase inhibitors inhibit the biotin carboxylase or carboxyltransferase site of accase. the methods described here could be applied toward the identification and characterization of novel inhibitors.

TI  == the challenges of antimicrobial drug resistance in greece.
AB  == antimicrobial drug resistance rates in greece are among the highest in europe. the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative species has increased considerably, including endemic strains in intensive care units. pandrug-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa are sporadically reported. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus rates are also high in greek hospitals. multidrug resistance increases risk of mortality, hospitalization duration and costs, and undermines the medical system. administrative responses initiated include action plans, monitoring systems, and guidelines. common terminology among involved parties for defining and grading resistance is required. multidrug-resistant microorganisms challenge clinical laboratories; uniform recommendations towards detection of resistance mechanisms need to be established. prospective multicenter outcome studies comparing antibiotic regimens and containment methods are needed. because new antimicrobials against gram-negative pathogens are not foreseeable, judicious use of the existing and strict adherence to infection control best practice might restrain resistance spread. awareness of resistance patterns and organisms prevailing locally by reporting laboratories and treating physicians is important.

AB  == this study aimed to examine the spectrum and time course of gut and nasopharyngeal colonization with gram-negative micro-organisms, and to define the value of surveillance cultures in predicting late-onset sepsis in neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units. nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected on admission and twice weekly thereafter in 278 neonates admitted within the first 72 h of life with risk factors of early-onset sepsis. sterile body fluid cultures were obtained on admission and subsequently as clinically indicated. approximately half of the rectal (693/1250, 55%) and nasopharyngeal (558/1153, 48%) samples but only 6% (32/555) of the sterile fluid samples in 26 patients were culture positive for gram-negative organisms. in total, 2108 invasive and mucosal culture pairs were analysed. the overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of a mucosal sample to predict late-onset sepsis were 27%, 66%, 4% and 94%, respectively. patients with  pre-existing colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.011), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.002), escherichia coli (p = 0.003), stenotrophomonas spp. (p = 0.003) and pseudomonas spp. (p </= 0.001) were more likely to develop late-onset  sepsis. no such association was found for acinetobacter baumannii, serratia spp.  or enterobacter cloacae. in conclusion, routine mucosal cultures are inefficient  for the prediction of gram-negative late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care  units. however, targeted screening for specific organisms in an outbreak (e.g. klebsiella spp., e. coli, stenotrophomonas spp. and pseudomonas spp.) may offer an opportunity to improve infection control measures and enable timely initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.

AB  == the rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. we have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (no-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. although the prior findings suggest that the no-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of no-np has yet to be fully elucidated. in the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a no-np against several gram-positive and -negative  clinical isolates. we found that the no-np were uniformly active against all of the streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. we concluded that the no-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.

TI  == metallo-beta-lactamases: a last frontier for beta-lactams?
AB  == metallo-beta-lactamases are resistance determinants of increasing clinical relevance in gram-negative bacteria. because of their broad range, potent carbapenemase activity and resistance to inhibitors, these enzymes can confer resistance to almost all beta-lactams. since the 1990s, several metallo-beta-lactamases encoded by mobile dna have emerged in important gram-negative pathogens (ie, in enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii). some of these enzymes (eg, vim-1 and ndm-1) have been involved in the recent crisis resulting from the international dissemination of carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and other enterobacteria. although substantial knowledge about the molecular biology and genetics of metallo-beta-lactamases is available, epidemiological data are inconsistent and clinical experience is still lacking; therefore, several unsolved or debatable issues remain about the management of infections caused by producers of metallo-beta-lactamase. the spread of metallo-beta-lactamases presents a major challenge both for treatment of individual patients and for policies of infection control, exposing the substantial unpreparedness of public health structures in facing up to this emergency.

TI  == the challenges of antimicrobial resistance in brazil.
AB  == brazil is a country with continental proportions with high geographic and economic diversity. despite its medical centers of excellence, antimicrobial resistance poses a major therapeutic challenge. rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus are up to 60% and are related to an endemic brazilian clone. local resistance to vancomycin in enterococci was first related to enterococcus faecalis, which differs from european and american epidemiology. also, local klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have a much higher prevalence (40%-50% and 10%-18%, respectively). carbapenem resistance among the enterobacteriaceae group  is becoming a major problem, and k. pneumoniae carbapenemase isolates have been reported in different states. among nonfermenters, carbapenem resistance is strongly related to spm-1 (pseudomonasaeruginosa) and oxa-23 (acinetobacter baumannii complex) enzymes, and a colistin-only susceptible phenotype has also emerged in these isolates, which is worrisome. local actions without loosing the  global resistance perspective will demand multidisciplinary actions, new policies, and political engagement.

TI  == changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern taiwan.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. we evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at  a tertiary medical center in northern taiwan. methods: we conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. the numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third  period, 1999-2005. results: during the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. a significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant s pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and  imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. additionally, a significant increase  in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for e coli, enterobacter cloacae, and a baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). however, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005  was found for groups a and b streptococci, non-a, b, d streptococci, and s pneumoniae. conclusion: resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.

TI  == [infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens].
AB  == background: intensive therapy units are the places where pathogens can easily spread. improper antibiotic therapy contributes to the selection of new strains called multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant or pandrug-resistant. for  itu patients, such pathogens are particularly dangerous. case report: the case of a 50-year-old man diagnosed with septic shock after repeated surgeries due to vater's ampulla tumour was described. in blood and peritoneal fluid cultures, enterobacter cloacae esbl and klebsiella pneumoniae were first isolated; then acinetobacter baumannii was also detected. the targeted antibiotic therapy instituted did not bring the expected results. on day 5, tigecycline and imipenem were started and continued over 10 days. after 4 days of combined therapy, bacterial strains were eradicated. the patient was sent to the referring ward in  good condition. conclusion: combined use of imipenem and a new antibiotic - tigecycline provides effective treatment of septic shock in the course of intra-abdominal infection.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing canward surveillance study. in total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution method. compared with other cephalosporins, including  ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), with a mic(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa)  (mic(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated mrsa (mic(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against staphylococcus  epidermidis; all isolates of mssa and mrsa tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (mic, </=1 mug/ml). against streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline mics (mic(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of s. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. all isolates of s. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (mic, </=0.25 mug/ml). among gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (mic(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (mic(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against enterobacter spp., acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered gram-positive and gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across canada in 2009.

TI  == emergence of ndm-1-producing acinetobacter baumannii in china.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the prevalence of bla(ndm-1) in gram-negative bacilli  in china. methods: a total of 11 298 clinical gram-negative bacilli, covering escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas  aeruginosa, were collected for pcr-based surveillance of bla(ndm-1) from 57 hospitals representing 18 provinces in china. for bla(ndm-1)-positive isolates, antibiotic susceptibilities were assessed and molecular typing was performed using pfge. the genetic location of bla(ndm-1) was determined by analysis of pfge profiles of s1 nuclease-digested genomic dna and southern blot hybridization. plasmid transfer to e. coli recipients was investigated using filter mating and electroporation. results: four a. baumannii isolates with bla(ndm-1) were identified in four different provinces in china: no positive isolates were detected among e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa. these bla(ndm-1)-positive a. baumannii were resistant to all carbapenems and cephalosporins, and three remained susceptible to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and colistin. the four ndm-1-producing a. baumannii were clonally diverse and carried bla(ndm-1) on different plasmids. plasmids carrying bla(ndm-1) were successfully transferred from three of the four isolates to e. coli recipients, although the transconjugants and transformants were prone to lose the transferred plasmids after passage in the absence of ampicillin selection. conclusions: we describe the emergence of a. baumannii producing ndm-1 in china. systemic surveillance network should be established for monitoring these resistant bacteria.

TI  == high burden of antimicrobial resistance in asia.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. marked variations in the resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens as well as the quality of public hygiene have had a considerable impact on the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents in asian countries. in asia, one of  the epicentres of antimicrobial drug resistance, there is an alarming number of antibiotic-resistant species, including penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, multidrug-resistant (mdr) acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (particularly mediated by ctx-m-9, ctx-m-14 and ctx-m-15), new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (ndm-1)-producing enterobacteriaceae, mdr salmonella enterica serotypes choleraesuis and typhi, carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii (oxa-58 and oxa-23 carbapenemases) and azole-resistant candida glabrata. a few clones of mdr a. baumannii and hospital-acquired meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) have been widely disseminated in hospital settings in asia, and k. pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing k. pneumoniae strains have been widely distributed  in china. in addition, the emergence of extensively drug-resistant mycobacterium  tuberculosis (xdr-tb) has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of resistance profiles of clinical isolates as well as the deliberative use of fluoroquinolones. continuous surveillance of resistance data from clinical isolates as well as implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings are required to mitigate the progression of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy of peptide a3-apo in mouse models of multidrug-resistant wound and lung infections cannot be explained by in vitro activity against the pathogens involved.
AB  == although the designer proline-rich antimicrobial peptide a3-apo has only modest activity against escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro, in mouse  models of systemic and wound infections it shows superior efficacy compared with  conventional antibiotics. in this study, the efficacy of a3-apo in several additional mouse models was investigated, including staphylococcus aureus wound infection, mixed klebsiella pneumoniae-a. baumannii-proteus mirabilis wound infection and k. pneumoniae lung infection, mimicking blast wound infections, foot ulcers and ventilator-induced nosocomial infections, respectively. whilst the peptide practically did not kill the strains in vitro, when administered intramuscularly or as an aerosol it significantly improved mouse survival and reduced bacterial counts at the infection site and in blood. in the lung infection study, the blood bacterial counts following a3-apo treatment were as low as after treatment with colistin and were lower than after treatment with imipenem or amikacin. the wounds of treated animals, unlike their untreated counterparts, lacked pus and signs of inflammation. in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a3-apo upregulated the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 by four- to six-fold. one of the mechanisms mediating the in vivo protective effects might be the prevention of inflammation around bacterial infiltration.

TI  == rapid genotyping of achromobacter xylosoxidans, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates using melting curve analysis of rapd-generated dna fragments (mcrapd).
AB  == typing of bacteria is important for monitoring newly emerging pathogens and for examining local outbreaks. we evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic dna technique in combination with melting curve analysis (mcrapd) of the amplified dna fragments to genotype isolates from five gram-negative species, i.e. achromobacter xylosoxidans, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. by determining the melting temperature peaks of the amplified dna fragments, we were able to distinguish the different genotypes of isolates, as they had been assessed by other genotyping techniques, i.e. agarose gel electrophoresis of rapd fragments,  multilocus sequence typing and/or aflp. according to our results, mcrapd may offer the possibility of genotyping a limited number of bacterial isolates, e.g.  in case of suspicion of hospital outbreak, via a less costly, more rapid, less laborious and more user-friendly technique than rapd followed by electrophoresis.

TI  == antimicrobial drug resistance in taiwan.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is a major global health threat associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. geographic variations in resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens have had a considerable impact on antimicrobial prescription. in taiwan, there is an alarmingly high prevalence of  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (xdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant neisseria gonorrhoeae, and azole-resistant candida species. in addition, the emergence of xdr mycobacterium  tuberculosis has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of the resistance profiles of clinical isolates. a few clones of xdr a. baumannii and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of unique sequence type (st 59) have  disseminated in taiwanese hospital settings. besides, the existence of a transposon-harboring carbapenemase gene has been verified in xdr p aeruginosa strains throughout taiwan. an end to the worsening trends in the emergence of antimicrobial resistance will require continuous survey of resistance data from clinical isolates and effective implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings and animal husbandry.

TI  == multiresistant gram-negative bacteria: the role of high-risk clones in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == multilocus sequence typing reveals that many bacterial species have a clonal structure and that some clones are widespread. this underlying phylogeny was not  revealed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, a method better suited to short-term outbreak investigation. some global clones are multiresistant and it is easy to assume that these have disseminated from single foci. such conclusions need caution, however, unless there is a clear epidemiological trail, as with kpc carbapenemase-positive klebsiella pneumoniae st258 from greece to northwest europe. elsewhere, established clones may have repeatedly and independently acquired resistance. thus, the global st131 escherichia coli clone most often has ctx-m-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl), but also occurs without esbls and as a host of many other esbl types. we explore this interaction of clone and  resistance for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii- a species where three global lineages dominate--and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which shows clonal diversity, but includes the relatively 'tight' serotype o12/burst group 4 cluster that has proved adept at acquiring resistances--from pse-1 to vim-1 beta-lactamases--for over 20 years. in summary, 'high-risk clones' play a major role in the spread of resistance, with the risk lying in their tenacity--deriving from poorly understood survival traits--and a flexible ability to accumulate and  switch resistance, rather than to constant resistance batteries.

TI  == a multicentre surveillance study on the characteristics, bacterial aetiologies and in vitro antibiotic susceptibilities in patients with acute exacerbations of  chronic bronchitis.
AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial resistance is a global problem and the prevalence is high in many asian countries. methods: a prospective observational  study of the prevalence of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb) was conducted in indonesia, philippines, korea, thailand, malaysia, taiwan and hong kong from august 2006 to april 2008. the diagnosis of aecb was based on  increased cough and worsening of two of following: dyspnoea, increased sputum volume or purulence. patients who had taken antibiotics within 72 h of presentation were excluded. all bacterial strains were submitted to a central laboratory for re-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to 16 antimicrobial agents according to clinical and laboratory standards institute. results: four hundred and seven isolates were identified among 447 patients of aecb. the most frequent organisms isolated were klebsiella pneumoniae and associated species (n = 91 + 17), haemophilus influenzae (n = 71), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 63), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 32), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 22) and moraxella catarrhalis (n = 21). according to clinical and laboratory standards institute susceptibility breakpoints, 85.7% and >90% of these pathogens were susceptible to levofloxacin and cefepime respectively. other options with overall lower susceptibilities include imipenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and amoxicillin/clavulanate. conclusions: gram-negative bacteria including klebsiella spp., p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. constitute a large proportion of pathogens identified in patients with aecb in some asian countries. surveillance  on the local prevalence and antibiotic resistance of these organisms is important in guiding appropriate choice of antimicrobials in the management of aecb.

TI  == the prevention of biofilm colonization by multidrug-resistant pathogens that cause ventilator-associated pneumonia with antimicrobial-coated endotracheal tubes.
AB  == ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) continues to be the nosocomial infection associated with the highest mortality in critically ill patients. since silver-coated endotracheal tubes (ett) was shown in a multicenter prospective randomized trials to decrease the risk of vap, we compared the efficacy of two antiseptic agents such as gardine- and gendine-coated etts with that of silver-coated etts in preventing biofilm. the etts were tested for their ability  to prevent the biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and candida albicans. scanning electron microscopy studies  revealed a heavy biofilm on uncoated and silver-coated ett but not on the gardine-coated ett. the gardine and gendine etts completely inhibited the formation of biofilms by all organisms tested and were more effective in preventing biofilm growth than the silver etts (p < 0.001). the gardine- and gendine-coated etts were more durable against mrsa than either the silver-coated  or uncoated etts for up to 2 weeks (p < 0.0001). we have therefore shown that gardine- and gendine-coated etts are superior to silver-coated etts in preventing biofilm. future animal and clinical studies are warranted to determine whether the gardine- and gendine-coated etts can significantly reduce the risk of vap.

AB  == five peptides with antimicrobial activity were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the tetraploid frog xenopus clivii peracca, 1898 (pipidae). characterization of the peptides demonstrated that they  are structurally similar to magainins (2 peptides), caerulein-precursor fragments, cpf (2 peptides), and xenopsin-precursor fragments, xpf (1 peptide) that have been previously isolated from other species of the genus xenopus. the magainins and the xpf peptide were active only against the gram-negative microorganism escherichia coli whereas the cpf peptides were also active against  the gram-positive staphylococcus aureus. the most abundant antimicrobial peptide  in the secretions, cpf-c1 (gfgsllgkalrlg anvl.nh(2)) inhibited the growth of the  gram-negative bacteria acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic</=25mum) suggesting potential for development into an anti-infective agent for use against these emerging antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

AB  == tigecycline is a broad spectrum antibiotic having activity against multiresistant isolates. in vitro susceptibility testing is difficult to perform with the use of traditional microbiological techniques. the aim of this study was to evaluate the disk diffusion test with three different mueller-hinton agar brands, and the vitek 2 automated system in comparison with the standard broth microdilution method against 200 gram-negative isolates (escherichia coil, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and acinetobacter baumannii). among enterobacteriaceae, the becton dickinson agar had the lowest rate of minor (32.5%) and major errors (3.8%). no very major errors were found. for a. baumanni, the rate of minor and major errors was lower. a high rate of agreement (94%) was found between the broth microdilution method and the vitek 2  system. our results show that there are important differences between agars used  for the disk diffusion test, and that vitek 2 is a valid tool for susceptibility  testing in clinical laboratories.

TI  == pharmacodynamic profiling of intravenous antibiotics against prevalent gram-negative organisms across the globe: the passport program-asia-pacific region.
AB  == due to escalating antimicrobial resistance amongst gram-negative organisms, the choice of effective empirical antimicrobial regimens has become challenging. monte carlo simulations were conducted for conventional and prolonged infusion regimens of doripenem, imipenem and meropenem using pharmacokinetic data from adult patients with conserved renal function. minimum inhibitory concentration data against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and  acinetobacter baumannii were incorporated from the compact surveillance programme in the asia-pacific region of the world. the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) was determined for each regimen against each bacterial population. all simulated carbapenem regimens achieved an optimal cfr against e. coli and k. pneumoniae (94.5-100% cfr). against p. aeruginosa, doripenem achieved 78.7-92.6%  cfr, imipenem achieved 60.4-79.0% cfr and meropenem achieved 73.0-85.1% cfr. the  only dosing regimen to achieve >/= 90% cfr against p. aeruginosa was doripenem 1000 mg and 2000 mg every 8 h (4-h infusion). carbapenem cfrs against a. baumannii were much lower (29.2-54.4% cfr). cfrs for non-fermenting isolates were ca. 10% lower for isolates collected in the intensive care unit. carbapenem resistance amongst enterobacteriaceae remains low in the asia-pacific region and  thus standard carbapenem dosing regimens had a high likelihood of achieving pharmacodynamic exposures. however, larger doses combined with prolonged infusion will be required to increase the cfr for these carbapenems against resistant non-fermenting gram-negatives that are common in these countries. the safety and  efficacy of these high dosing regimens will need to be confirmed in the clinical  setting.

TI  == multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria: how to treat and for how long.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacilli creates a big problem for the treatment of nosocomial infections. as the pharmaceutical pipeline wanes, the only therapeutic options are two revived antibacterials (colistin and fosfomycin), a newer one (tigecycline) and an early-phase neoglycoside (achn-490). polymyxins, known since 1947, are mostly represented by  polymyxin e (colistin), which has recently gained a principal position in the management of the most difficult-to-treat mdr gram-negative pathogens -pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae. however, despite promising therapeutic results in 59-75% of cases, the reported studies share common drawbacks, i.e. the absence of a control group, their retrospective nature, variable dosing and duration of therapy, simultaneous administration of other antibiotics in >70% and a lack of resistance development  monitoring. the necessity for well-designed prospective clinical trials is therefore urgent. fosfomycin is active in vitro against mdr enterobacteriaceae, including a high proportion of p. aeruginosa; however, clinical experience is lacking with the parenteral formulation in mdr infection and on the best combinations to prevent resistance development. tigecycline, which is active against mdr enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii, has shown satisfactory clinical  experience. however, dosage adjustment is required because of low blood levels. achn-490, which has promising in vitro activity against mdr k. pneumoniae, is still in early phase ii trials in urinary tract infections. meanwhile, the strict application of infection control measures is the cornerstone of nosocomial infection prevention, and antibiotic stewardship, exemplified by appropriate duration of therapy and de-escalation policies, should not be overlooked.

AB  == importance of the field: although colistin has recently played a key role in the  treatment of nosocomial infections due to multidrug resistant gram-negative pathogens, there is a lack of clinical studies examining colistin pharmacokinetics (pks) in humans. this refers to all routes of colistin administration in clinical practice. colistin pk data are also limited in critically ill patients. areas covered in this review: literature search took into account data dealing with colistin pk obtained from animal studies performed during previous decades (1970s, 1980s and 1990s) and from recent human studies performed during the last decade. what the reader will gain: valuable information on pharmacodynamics (pd)/pk of colistin used in the treatments of nosocomial infections due to multidrug resistant gram-negative pathogens, mostly pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae. a better understanding of pks could offer significant improvement of colistin use in humans, especially optimization of colistin doses in different routes of administration in order to maximize clinical efficacy and minimize adverse effects and rate of resistance. take home message: there is a lack of human studies on colistin pk and pd. significant pd parameters best predicting colistin efficacy and their optimal values such as c(max):mic ratio, auc/mic and t > mic have not yet been clearly defined. it should be noted that further investigation  on colistin pk/pd in vitro and in vivo models is required.

TI  == resurgence of colistin: a review of resistance, toxicity, pharmacodynamics, and dosing.
AB  == colistin is a polymyxin antibiotic that was discovered in the late 1940s for the  treatment of gram-negative infections. after several years of clinical use, its popularity diminished because of reports of significant nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. recently, the antibiotic has resurfaced as a last-line treatment option for multidrug-resistant organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the need for antibiotics with coverage of these gram-negative pathogens is critical because of their high morbidity and mortality, making colistin a very important treatment option. unfortunately, however, resistance to colistin has been documented among all three of these organisms in case reports. although the exact mechanism causing colistin resistance has not been defined, it is hypothesized that the pmra-pmrb and phop-phoq genetic regulatory systems may play a role. colistin dosages must be optimized, as colistin is a last-line treatment option; in addition, suboptimal doses have been linked to the development of resistance. the lack of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and no universal harmonization of dose units, however, have made it difficult to derive optimal dosing regimens and specific dosing guidelines for colistin. in critically ill patients who may have  multiorgan failure, renal insufficiency may alter colistin pharmacokinetics. therefore, dosage alterations in this patient population are imperative to achieve maximal efficacy and minimal toxicity. with regard to colistin toxicity,  most studies show that nephrotoxicity is reversible and less frequent than once thought, and neurotoxicity is rare. further research is needed to fully understand the impact that the two regulatory systems have on resistance, as well as the dosages of colistin needed to inhibit and overcome these developing patterns.

TI  == [gram-negative bacteriae with resistance to carbapenems].
AB  == clinically-significant gram-negative species remain mostly enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. carbapenem molecules are often the last resort for treating infections due to multidrug resistant isolates. in enterobacteriaceae, resistance to carbapenems may result from combined mechanisms of resistance associating b-lactamases with weak (if any) intrinsic carbapenemase activity and decreased outer membrane permeability, or from true carbapenemases. kpc-type enzymes (partially inhibited by clavulanic acid) have been identified mostly in klebsiella pneumoniae, first in bacteria identified in the usa and then worldwide, and in many enterobacterial species. carbapenem-hydrolyzing b-lactamases (chbl) could be also metallo-b-lactamases (vim, imp, ndm-1, etc.) mostly in hospital-acquired k. pneumoniae. one of the latest reported chbl in enterobacteriaceae is oxa-48, identified mostly in mediterranean countries. all these carbapenemase producers are difficult to detect in a clinical laboratory and may be the source of multidrug resistance leading to a therapeutic dead end. whereas the main mechanism of resistance to imipenem in p. aeruginosa remains due to a modification of the outer membrane protein oprd, the landscape of chbl in p. aeruginosa expanding worldwide is made  of kpc, ges-related enzymes and metallo-b-lactamases (imp, vim, etc.). these enzymes are involved in multidrug resistance strains as a source of nosocomial outbreaks. in acinetobacter baumannii, kpc and metallo-b-lactamases have been identified. however, the most frequent chbl are oxacillinases (oxa-23, oxa-40, oxa-58, oxa-143) which are specific to that species. novel carbapenemases are continuously being identified worldwide with exchange of the resistance genes between enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii.

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility among bacterial isolates from intensive care unit patients of a tertiary-care university hospital in iran: 2006-2009.
AB  == background: this study was conducted to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among common pathogens in the intensive care unit (icu) of a university hospital in iran between 2006 and 2009. methods: the isolates cultured in appropriate media and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined by disk diffusion tests according to the guidelines of the clinical and laboratory standards institute. results: a total of 606 isolates were recovered from respiratory (70.63%), urine (20.13%), blood (4.95%) and wound (1.82%) specimens of 456 patients. the most common isolates were acinetobacter baumannii (22.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.6%), staphylococcus aureus (11.1%), escherichia coli (8.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (4.8%). less than 7% of a. baumannii isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, imipenem, cefepime  and ciprofloxacin. none was susceptible to piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam. the susceptibility rates of p. aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam were 13.6, 17.4 and 33.3%,  respectively. methicillin-resistant s. aureus made up 96.2% of s. aureus isolates and was 100% susceptible to vancomycin and 51.9% susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. conclusion: due to the high antimicrobial resistance in the icu, we must focus on both a wiser use of antimicrobials and the prevention of infection.

TI  == [recent progress in taxonomic studies on pathogenic nocardia and usefulness of the bacteria for the studies on secondary metabolites and antibiotic resistant mechanisms].
AB  == the present taxonomic situation of pathogenic actinomycetes including nocardia was clarified, and the impact of genomic sequence information of nocardia farcinica ifm 10152 on taxonomic work is introduced. the number of cases of nocardiosis is on the rise along with the increasing number of immunocompromised  patients in japan. from 1999 to 2007, 718 strains of pathogenic actinomycetes were received for identification by medical mycology research center (mmrc), chiba university. about 75% of these were classified into nocardia, major species being n. farcinica, n. nova, and n. brasiliensis. among the strains classified as nocardia species, there were some unclassifiable strains and taxonomic studies on these led to the proposal of more than 18 new species, resulting in more than 1/4 of all nocardia species having been proposed by our group. recently a new nocardia species, nocardia mikamii was proposed by american researchers. a new phylogenetic analysis method using gryb and seca1 genes was proposed for the nocardia and gordonia strains.our whole genome analysis of n. farcinica suggests  that the bacterium has unique and characteristic gene profiles, and also suggests that n. farcinica is similar to mycobacterium tuberculosis. n. farcinica also has siderophore (nocobactin) and mce genes which are similar to mycobactin (siderophore) of m. tuberculosis as virulence factors. nocardia strains were found to be producers of new secondary metabolites including antifungal, antitumor and immunosuppressive activities.we reported novel antibiotic resistance mechanisms such as ribosylation, glucosylation, phosphorylation and degradation of rifampicin, phosphorylation of aminoglycosides, and glucosylation  of macrolide antibiotics. among rifampicin inactivation mechanisms, ribosylation  was found to be through the arr enzyme that catalyzes adp-ribosylation of rifampicin in a fast-growing mycobacterium smegmatis. this unique mechanism has also been reported as an antibiotic resistant mechanism in pathogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii.our cooperative work on the elucidation of high-level resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic amikacin in n. farcinica with a research group from cdc, usa, revealed the presence of homozygous mutations in the 16r rrna genes which are responsible for high-level aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance.

TI  == [etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia in children].
AB  == objective: to investigate the etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) in children. method: a retrospective hospital infection  study was performed in 52,639 children admitted to our hospital from january 2005 to december 2008. result: six hundred and ninety eight patients were diagnosed as hap. the incidence of hap was 1.33%, among which, 108 (15.47%) cases were early-onset hap and 590 (84.53%) were late-onset hap. the hap patients aged 3 days to 15 years (503 male and 195 female). the proportion of patients younger than 1 year was 51.4%. main underlying diseases were cytomegalovirus hepatitis, congenital heart disease, malignant tumor, granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis, prematurity and low birth weight. there was significant difference in the incidences among different departments with the highest one seen in icu, followed by departments of infectious diseases, hematology and digestive diseases. two hundred and thirty one stains of pathogens were identified from sputum of 355 cases. one hundred and fifty six (67.5%) strains were gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. there were 30 (13.0%) gram-positive bacterial strains, and 29 (12.6%) respiratory tract virus strains, and 15 (6.5%)  fungal strains, and 1 (0.4%) mycoplasma strain. the predominant bacterial pathogens were klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. the isolation rates of klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were 94.8% and 85.7%, respectively. those two bacteria were universally resistant to the third and forth generations  cephalosporins. the main pathogens of early-onset hap were respiratory syncytial  virus (rsv), streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumonia, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, while the main pathogens of late-onset hap were esbls-positive klebsiella pneumonia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: hap in children is most common in children younger than 1 year and with underlying diseases. the main pathogens are gram-negative bacteria. rsv was an important pathogen of hap. the pathogens of early-onset hap are different from those of late-onset hap. these results may be of some help in prevention and control of hap in children and in guiding for rational application of antibiotics, especially the empirical antibiotic choice.

TI  == epidemiologic, clinical characteristics, and risk factors for adverse outcome in  multiresistant gram-negative primary bacteremia of critically ill patients.
AB  == background: characteristics and burden of primary bacteremia because of multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacteria (gnb) in intensive care unit (icu) patients remain understudied. methods: a cohort study of patients with primary mdr gnb-related bacteremia from the icu of a tertiary greek hospital during a 3-year period was conducted for recognition of clinical characteristics  and risk factors for adverse outcome. a case-control study was further performed  to evaluate risk factors for development of mdr gnb-related primary bacteremia. results: fifty monomicrobial episodes of primary bacteremia because of klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 20), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 18), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 12) were recorded. the presence of diabetes mellitus was the only significant risk factor for development of mdr gnb-related primary bacteremia. most episodes (78%) were icu acquired in patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation and previous hospitalization in the ward. mortality was 47.6% vs 19%  of controls, p = .01. mortality was higher in recurrent bacteremia (62.5%). mortality was statistically associated with age (p = .002) and degree of multiorgan dysfunction expressed by sequential organ failure assessment score on  day of bacteremia documentation (p = .001). conclusion: critically ill patients with mdr gnb-related primary bacteremia present significant mortality mainly associated with age and multiorgan failure. a baumanii bacteremia confers significant mortality compared with the benign course of k pneumoniae in such settings. diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for development of such episodes, which may, in part, be general ward acquired, underlining the need for expanded vigilance.

TI  == aerosolized plus intravenous colistin versus intravenous colistin alone for the treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a matched case-control study.
AB  == objectives: the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) due to multidrug-resistant (mdr) organisms is increasing. intravenous (iv) colistin or aerosolized (as) plus iv colistin have been recently used to treat these life-threatening infections. the purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of as plus iv colistin versus iv colistin alone for patients  with mdr vap due to gram-negative bacteria. methods: a retrospective matched case-control study was performed at the intensive care unit of the university hospital of heraklion, greece, from january 2005 through december 2008. forty-three patients with vap due gram-negative mdr pathogens received as plus iv colistin and were matched on the basis of age and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score with 43 control patients who had received iv colistin  alone. results: demographic characteristics, clinical status, and gram-negative isolated pathogens were similar between the 2 treatment groups. acinetobacter baumannii (66 cases [77%]) was the most common pathogen, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (12 cases [14%]) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 cases [9.3%]). no colistin-resistant strains were isolated from patients in either group. no significant differences between the 2 groups were observed regarding eradication  of pathogens (p = .679), clinical cure (p = .10), and mortality (p = .289). eight patients (19%) in each treatment group developed reversible renal dysfunction. no as colistin-related adverse events were recorded. conclusions: addition of as colistin to iv colistin did not provide additional therapeutic benefit to patients with mdr vap due to gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii: assessing their impact on organ transplantation.
AB  == purpose of review: this review highlights the impact of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae and carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii on patients who have undergone organ transplantation and explores both available and potential agents to treat infections caused by these multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens. recent findings: few antimicrobials exist to treat carbapenem-resistant gram-negative infections, and resistance to salvage therapies is escalating. organ transplantation appears to be a risk factor for infections with klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae. isolation of these mdr bacteria is increasing and may be associated with allograft failure and mortality. in the majority of cases, aminoglycosides, polymyxins, and tigecycline have been employed to treat these infections. anecdotal successes exist but these antibiotics may be unreliable. few novel agents are in development. summary: bacterial infections remain a leading cause of posttransplantation morbidity and mortality. carbapenem resistance is a significant threat to allograft and patient survival. with few antimicrobials being developed, transplant centers may be forced to make decisions regarding surveillance, empiric antimicrobial regimens, and transplant candidacy in the setting of carriage of mdr pathogens. there is an urgent need for collaborative studies to address the clinical impact of these infections on transplantation.

TI  == progress and challenges in implementing the research on eskape pathogens.
AB  == the eskape pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) are responsible for a substantial percentage of nosocomial infections in the modern hospital and represent the vast majority of isolates whose resistance  to antimicrobial agents presents serious therapeutic dilemmas for physicians. over the years, improved molecular biology techniques have led to detailed information about individual resistance mechanisms in all these pathogens. however, there remains a lack of compelling data on the interplay between resistance mechanisms and between the bacteria themselves. in addition, data on the impact of clinical interventions to decrease the prevalence of resistance are also lacking. the difficulty in identifying novel antimicrobial agents with reliable activity against these pathogens argues for an augmentation of research  in the basic and population science of resistance, as well as careful studies to  identify optimal strategies for infection control and antimicrobial use.

TI  == wound contraction effects and antibacterial properties of tualang honey on full-thickness burn wounds in rats in comparison to hydrofibre.
AB  == background: full-thickness burn wounds require excision and skin grafting. multiple surgical procedures are inevitable in managing moderate to severe full-thickness burns. wound bed preparations prior to surgery are necessary in order to prevent wound infection and promote wound healing. honey can be used to  treat burn wounds. however, not all the honey is the same. this study aims to evaluate the wound contraction and antibacterial properties of locally-produced tualang honey on managing full-thickness burn wounds in vivo. methods: thirty-six female sprague dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups. under anaesthesia, three full-thickness burn wounds were created on the dorsum of the rats. the full-thickness burn wounds were inoculated with a specific organism (10(4)), namely pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 12), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 12),  or acinetobacter baumannii (n = 12). the three burn wounds were dressed with tualang honey, hydrofibre and hydrofibre silver respectively. swab samples were obtained every 3 days (day 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21) for quantitative and semi-quantitative microbiological analyses. clinical assessments, including observations concerning the appearance and wound size, were measured at the same  time. results: there was a rapid 32.26% reduction in wound size by day 6 (p = 0.008) in the tualang honey-treated wounds, and 49.27% by day 15 (p = 0.005). the wounds remained smaller by day 18 (p < 0.032). tualang honey-treated rats demonstrated a reduction in bacterial growth in pseudomonas aeruginosa inoculated wounds (p = 0.005). however, hydrofibre silver and hydrofibre-treated wounds are  superior to honey-treated wounds with acinetobacter baumannii (p = 0.035). there  was no statistical significant of antibacterial property in klebsiella pneumonia  inoculated wounds. conclusions: tualang honey has better results with regards to  its control of pseudomonas aeruginosa and its wound contraction effects on full-thickness burn wound in vivo.

TI  == sensitization of microcin j25-resistant strains by a membrane-permeabilizing peptide.
AB  == microcin j25 (mccj25) is a plasmid-encoded, 21-amino-acid, antibacterial peptide  produced by escherichia coli. mccj25 inhibits rna polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain. mccj25 uptake into e. coli-sensitive strains is mediated by the outer membrane receptor fhua and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbb, exbd, and sbma. this peptide is active on some e. coli, salmonella, and shigella  species strains, while other gram-negative bacteria, such as clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, moraxella catarrhalis, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, are completely resistant. in the present work, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing peptide (kff)(3)k made some resistant strains sensitive to mccj25, among them s. typhimurium, where the antibiotic inhibits in vitro cell growth and bacterial replication within macrophages. the results demonstrate that the membrane permeabilization induced by (kff)(3)k allows mccj25 penetration in an fhua and sbma-independent manner and suggest that the combination of both peptides could be considered as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic salmonella strains.

TI  == suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus acticoat and aquacel as an antiseptic dressing: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: the treatment of burn wounds is still a challenge regarding the management of antiseptic wound conditioning. especially, in the united states, silver-containing dressings, such as acticoat and aquacel are frequently used. because silver-containing dressings have well-known drawbacks such as an antimicrobial lack against pseudomonas aeruginosa, we sought to develop an alternative dressing method. in previous studies, we could demonstrate the excellent antiseptic properties of acetic acid against common burn unit germs, and in another study, the feasibility and suitability of a suprathel-acetic acid  matrix as an antiseptic dressing. materials and methods: this study was designed  to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus acticoat and aquacel. to cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: escherichia coli, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive klebsiella pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. results: the tests showed an excellent bactericidal effect of the suprathel-acetic acid matrix particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as proteus vulgaris, p. aeruginosa,  and acinetobacter baumannii. the efficiency was superior to that of acicoat and aquacel. conclusions: our results support the notion, that the suprathel-acetic acid matrix has an excellent bactericidal effect and therefore seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent in the treatment of burn wounds.

TI  == influence of third-generation cephalosporin resistance on adult in-hospital mortality from post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.
AB  == background/purpose: to investigate the clinical features, etiology and predictors of in-hospital mortality in adults with post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.  methods: this retrospective analysis included 60 adult patients with culture-proven post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis hospitalized between september 2006 and august 2008. results: of the 60 patients, 88.3% had monomicrobial infection and 11.7% had mixed infection. the mean duration from the first neurosurgical procedure to the diagnosis of meningitis was 21 days (range,  1-134 days). the median frequency of neurosurgical procedure before meningitis was 1 (range, 1-5). a total of 69 isolates were identified from the cerebrospinal fluid, the most common pathogens were gram-negative bacilli (43, 62.3%), followed by gram-positive bacteria (24, 34.8%). the three most common gram-negative bacilli were serratia marcescens (7, 10.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.7%), and enterobacter cloacae (4, 5.8%). pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii isolates comprised less than 3%. notably, glucose non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli other than acinetobacter and pseudomonas spp. accounted for 11.6% of the total. of the gram-negative bacilli, resistance rates to the third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, were 58.1% and 34.9%, respectively. the two most common gram-positive pathogens were staphylococcus aureus (10, 14.5%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (including s. epidermidis) (10, 14.5%). the in-hospital mortality rate was 15.0%, which was  significantly related to gram-negative bacilli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in multivariate analysis (adjusted odds ratio = 33.65; p = 0.047). conclusion: these findings may portend the spread of serious resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in nosocomial gram-negative bacilli throughout the neurosurgical units, suggestive of the need to reassess the empirical use of  third-generation cephalosporins in post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase production of selected gram-negative bacilli from two croatian hospitals: mystic study results.
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network that monitors the activity of meropenem and compares its activity with other broadspectrum antimicrobial agents. we now report the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem compared to other broad-spectrum agents within the selective gram-negative pathogen groups from two croatian hospitals investigated between 2002-2007. a total of 1510 gram-negative pathogens were tested and the minimum-inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by broth microdilution method according to  clsi.there was no resistance to either imipenem or meropenem observed for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis in both medical centers. high resistance rates of k. pneumoniae to ceftazidime (18%), cefepime (17%) and gentamicin (39%) are raising concern. acinetobacter baumannii turned out to be the most resistant gram-negative bacteria with 81% resistant to ceftazidime, 73% to cefepime, 69% to gentamicin and 71% to ciprofloxacin. almost  20% of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to imipenem, 13% to meropenem, 69% to gentamicin and 38% to ciprofloxacin.the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in e. coli was 10% and in k. pneumoniae 49%. pcr and sequencing of the amplicons revealed the presence of shv-5 in nine e. coli strains and additional tem-1 beta-lactamase five strains. five k. pneumoniae strains were positive for bla(shv-5 )gene. eight esbl positive enterobacter spp. strains were found to produce tem and ctx-m beta-lactamases. plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases were not found among k. pneumoniae, e. coli and enterobacter spp. three a. baumannii strains from zagreb university center were identified by multiplex pcr as oxa-58 like producers. six a. baumannii strains from split university center were found to possess an isaba1 insertion sequence upstream of bla(oxa-51 )gene. according to our results meropenem remains an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. these data indicate that despite continued use of meropenem, carbapenem resistance is not increasing among species tested, except for a. baumannii, in the two study hospitals and suggest that clinicians can still administer carbapenems as a reliable and effective choice in managing serious nosocomial infections.

TI  == evaluation of a dna microarray, the check-points esbl/kpc array, for rapid detection of tem, shv, and ctx-m extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and kpc carbapenemases.
AB  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (kpc carbepenemases) have rapidly emerged worldwide and require rapid identification. the check-points esbl/kpc array, a new commercial system based on genetic profiling for the direct identification of esbl producers (shv,  tem, and ctx-m) and of kpc producers, was evaluated. well-characterized gram-negative rods (enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii) expressing various ss-lactamases (kpc-2, shv, tem, and ctx-m types) were used as well as wild-type reference strains and isolates harboring ss-lactamase genes not detected by the assay. in addition, phenotypically confirmed esbl producers isolated in clinical samples over a 3-month period at the bicetre hospital were analyzed using the check-points esbl/kpc array and by standard pcr. the check-points esbl/kpc array allowed fast detection of all tem,  shv, and ctx-m esbl genes and of the kpc-2 gene. the assay allowed easy differentiation between non-esbl tem and shv and their esbl derivatives. none of  the other tested ss-lactamase genes were detected, underlining its high specificity. the technique is suited for enterobacteriaceae but also for p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii. however, for nonfermenters, especially p. aeruginosa, a 1:10 dilution of the total dna was necessary to detect kpc-2 and shv-2a genes reliably. the check-points esbl/kpc array is a powerful high-throughput tool for rapid identification of esbls and kpc producers in cultures. it provided definitive results within the same working day, allowing rapid implementation of isolation measures and appropriate antibiotic treatment.  it showed an interesting potential for routine laboratory testing.

TI  == dramatic increase of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant e. coli in german intensive care units: secular trends in antibiotic drug use and bacterial resistance, 2001 to 2008.
AB  == introduction: the objective of the present study was to analyse secular trends in antibiotic consumption and resistance data from a network of 53 intensive care units (icus). methods: the study involved prospective unit and laboratory-based surveillance in 53 german icus from 2001 through 2008. data were calculated on the basis of proportions of nonduplicate resistant isolates, resistance densities (that is, the number of resistant isolates of a species per 1,000 patient-days) and an antimicrobial usage density (ad) expressed as daily defined doses (ddd) and normalised per 1,000 patient-days. results: total mean antibiotic use remained stable over time and amounted to 1,172 ddd/1,000 patient-days (range 531 to 2,471). carbapenem use almost doubled to an ad of 151 in 2008. significant increases were also calculated for quinolone (ad of 163 in 2008) and third-generation and fourth-generation cephalosporin use (ad of 117 in 2008). aminoglycoside consumption decreased substantially (ad of 86 in 2001 and 24 in 2008). resistance proportions were as follows in 2001 and 2008, respectively: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 26% and 20% (p = 0.006; trend  test showed a significant decrease), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) faecium 2.3% and 8.2% (p = 0.008), third-generation cephalosporin (3gc)-resistant escherichia. coli 1.2% and 19.7% (p < 0.001), 3gc-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae 3.8% and 25.5% (p < 0.001), imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii 1.1% and 4.5% (p = 0.002), and imipenem-resistant k. pneumoniae 0.4% and 1.1%. the resistance densities did not change for mrsa but increased significantly for vre  faecium and 3gc-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. in 2008, the resistance density for mrsa was 3.73, 0.48 for vre, 1.39 for 3gc-resistant e. coli and 0.82  for k. pneumoniae. conclusions: although total antibiotic use did not change over time in german icus, carbapenem use doubled. this is probably due to the rise in  3gc-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. increased carbapenem consumption was associated with carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria and imipenem-resistant a. baumannii.

TI  == the impact of fluoroquinolones use on antibiotic resistance in an intensive care  burn department.
AB  == background: fluoroquinolones (fq) use has been identified as a risk factor for colonization and infection to methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus(mrsa),  pseudomonas aeruginosae multiresistant(pmr) , acinetobacter multiresistant (amr)  and multidrug resistant bacteria(mdrb). aim: our study proposes to measure the annual antibiotic use of fq and antimicrobial resistance in p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae and a. baumannii in an intensive care burn unit. methods: the study was conducted during a 4 year period (1 january 2000 to 31 december 2003). antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method as recommended by the french society of microbiology. the consumption of the following antibiotics: ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin was expressed  as the antimicrobial use density (ad) taking into account the quantity of antibiotics in grams converted to defined daily doses (ddd) and the number of day hospitalization. statistical significance was defined as p value < 0.05 for the corresponding correlation coefficient. results: there were statistically significant relationship between use of ciprofloxacin and resistance in p. aeruginosa to this drug (rs=0.95, p<0.05). moreover, the ciprofloxacin consumption was correlated with resistance to imipenem (rs=0.95, p<0.05) and ceftazidime (rs=0.95, p<0.05) in p. aeruginosa . a restriction use of ciprofloxacin has been taken during 2003, it is followed by a significant decrease of resistance to imipenem, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin in p. aeruginosa (p<0, 05). the use of fluoroquinolones was correlated significantly with mrsa (rs=0.96, p<0.05) . the restriction use of fq was significantly associated with a decrease of mrsa. the consumption of ciprofloxacin was also correlated (p<0.05) with resistance of ceftazidime in k. pneumoniae. however, there is not a correlation (p> 0.05) between fluoroquinolones use and resistance  in a. baumannii as well in ciprofloxacin, imipenem and ceftazidime. our study illustrates the pressure of selection of fluoroquinolones use in the development  of mdrb. the use and or the duration of treatment with theses antibiotics should  be rationalised as part of efforts to control the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria.

TI  == a novel polymyxin derivative that lacks the fatty acid tail and carries only three positive charges has strong synergism with agents excluded by the intact outer membrane.
AB  == polymyxins are cationic lipopeptides (five cationic charges) and the last resort  for the treatment of serious gram-negative infections caused by multiresistant strains. nab741 has a cyclic peptide portion identical to that of polymyxin b but carries in the linear peptide portion a threonyl-d-serinyl residue (no cationic charges) instead of the diaminobutyryl-threonyl-diaminobutyryl residue (two cationic charges). at the n terminus of the peptide, nab741 carries an acetyl group instead of a mixture of methyl octanoyl and methyl heptanoyl residues. nab741 sensitized escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae,  and acinetobacter baumannii to antibiotics against which the intact outer membrane is an effective permeability barrier. when tested by using etest strips  on plates containing increasing concentrations of nab741, the fractional inhibition concentration index (fici) of the combination of nab741 with rifampin  ranged from <or=0.111 to 0.158 and that with clarithromycin from <or=0.094 to 0.292. when tested by the checkerboard method, the corresponding fici values against e. coli atcc 25922 were <or=0.141 to <or=0.155 with rifampin and 0.094 with clarithromycin. in addition, at 4 microg/ml, nab741 decreased the mics of azithromycin, mupirocin, fusidic acid, and vancomycin for e. coli strains and e.  cloacae by factors ranging from 8 to 200. a sister peptide, nab752, carrying a threonyl-aminobutyryl residue as the linear peptide portion, was inactive. furthermore, nab741 sensitized e. coli to the bactericidal activity of fresh guinea pig serum. the renal clearance of nab741 was approximately 400-fold, 16-fold, and 8-fold higher than those measured for colistin, nab7061, and nab739, respectively.

TI  == pharmacodynamic modeling of intravenous antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria collected in the united states.
AB  == background: in the era of escalating antimicrobial resistance, the choice of effective empiric antimicrobial therapy has become considerably more difficult. in an attempt to improve antimicrobial selection, pharmacodynamic modeling that considers the drug, dose, dosing interval, and duration of infusion is increasingly used as a tool to assist in the clinical decision-making process. objective: the aim of the passport (probability of target attainment of antibacterial agents studied for susceptibility and pharmacodynamic optimization  in regional trials) study was to compare the probabilities of achieving requisite pharmacodynamic exposure (eg, t>mic, auc/mic) of common intravenous antibiotics against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. methods: using a 5000-patient monte carlo simulation, pharmacodynamic analyses were conducted for standard and high-dose, prolonged (ie, 3-to 4-hour) infusions of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, doripenem, ertapenem, imipenem, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam in adult patients with normal renal function (>or=50 ml/min). mic data were incorporated from the 2008 trust (tracking resistance in the united states today)-12 surveillance program, a long-running resistance study in 56 participating us hospitals. the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) was determined for each regimen against each population of e coli, k pneumoniae, a baumannii, and p aeruginosa. optimal cfr was defined a priori as >or=90%. results: all of the beta-lactam regimens had optimal cfrs against e coli, and all but piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g q6h had optimal cfrs against k pneumoniae. the fluoroquinolones had the lowest cfrs against all of the pathogen populations  tested (73.2%-88.9% against e coli and k pneumortfae; 44.5 %-61.9 % against a baumannii and p aeruginosa). optimal cfr against a baumannii was not achieved with any of the regimens. against p aeruginosa, high-dose, prolonged-infusion doripenem and meropenem had cfrs of 97.2% to 98.8%, followed by high-dose, prolonged-infusion ceftazidime (93.3%) and cefepime (93.2%). high-dose, prolonged-infusion regimens were associated with increased cfrs for all (beta-lactams by approximately 10% over that of standard 0.5-hour infusion regimens against the nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli. conclusions: based on this model, standard doses of most intravenous (beta-lactam regimens had high probabilities of achieving optimal exposure against enterobacteriaceae. for nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli such as a baumannii and p aeruginosa, high-dose, prolonged infusions of cefepime, ceftazidime, doripenem, and meropenem had the highest probabilities of achieving bactericidal exposure.

TI  == the global problem of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == amid the recent attention justly focused on the potential problem of microbial sources for weapons of bioterrorism, it is also apparent that human pathogens frequently isolated from infections in patients from community and hospital sources have been growing more resistant to commonly used antibiotics. much of the growth of multiple-drug-resistant (mdr) bacterial pathogens can be contributed to the overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobial products. however, an  equally troubling and often overlooked component of the problem involves the elegant ways in which pathogenic bacteria continually evolve complex genetic systems for acquiring and regulating an endless array of antibiotic-resistance mechanisms. efforts to develop new antimicrobials have over the past two decades  been woefully behind the rapid evolution of resistance genes developing among both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. several new agents that are best  suited for use in the hospital environment have been developed to combat staphylococci resistant to beta-lactam antimicrobials following acquisition of the meca gene. however, the dramatic spread in the us of the now common community strain of staphylococcus aureus usa300 has shifted the therapeutic need for new antibiotics useful against mrsa to the community. as the pharmaceutical industry  focused on discovering new agents for use against mrsa, hospitals in many parts of the world have seen the emergence of gram-negative pathogens such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae that are clinically resistant to almost all available antimicrobials. such mdr isolates usually contain multiple-resistance determinants, including loss of outer membrane porins via gene inactivation by chromosomally encoded insertion sequences, up-regulation of inate efflux pumps, as well as acquisition of drug-inactivating enzymes whose genes are encoded on self-transmissible plasmids, integrons, and complex transposable elements. these determinants confer a complex resistance phenotype that is often superimposed on mutations in the primary drug  target in the cell. the continued evolution of such a complex array of antibiotic-resistance genes presents a formidable challenge at a time when large  pharmaceutical companies have scaled down their presence in the anti-infectives arena.

TI  == international nosocomial infection control consortium (inicc) report, data summary for 2003-2008, issued june 2009.
AB  == we report the results of the international infection control consortium (inicc) surveillance study from january 2003 through december 2008 in 173 intensive care  units (icus) in latin america, asia, africa, and europe. during the 6-year study, using centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) us national healthcare safety network (nhsn; formerly the national nosocomial infection surveillance system [nnis]) definitions for device-associated health care-associated infection, we collected prospective data from 155,358 patients hospitalized in the consortium's hospital icus for an aggregate of 923,624 days. although device  utilization in the developing countries' icus was remarkably similar to that reported from us icus in the cdc's nhsn, rates of device-associated nosocomial infection were markedly higher in the icus of the inicc hospitals: the pooled rate of central venous catheter (cvc)-associated bloodstream infections (bsi) in  the inicc icus, 7.6 per 1000 cvc-days, is nearly 3-fold higher than the 2.0 per 1000 cvc-days reported from comparable us icus, and the overall rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) was also far higher, 13.6 versus 3.3 per 1000 ventilator-days, respectively, as was the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (cauti), 6.3 versus 3.3 per 1000 catheter-days, respectively. most strikingly, the frequencies of resistance of staphylococcus aureus isolates to methicillin (mrsa) (84.1% vs 56.8%, respectively), klebsiella  pneumoniae to ceftazidime or ceftriaxone (76.1% vs 27.1%, respectively), acinetobacter baumannii to imipenem (46.3% vs 29.2%, respectively), and pseudomonas aeruginosa to piperacillin (78.0% vs 20.2%, respectively) were also far higher in the consortium's icus, and the crude unadjusted excess mortalities  of device-related infections ranged from 23.6% (cvc-associated bloodstream infections) to 29.3% (vap).

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for hospital acquired pneumonia.
AB  == the in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 819 baseline pathogens isolated from 383 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trial investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in hospital acquired pneumonia (hap). the trials were global, enrolling patients in 27 countries. tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in hap, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains (90% of mics </=2 microg/ml for the entire collection). the spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant s. aureus), enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus complex, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, and enterobacter cloacae. as reported previously, a few genera, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and the proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. the excellent in vitro, expanded, broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with with hospital acquired pneumonia infections.

TI  == colistin administration to pediatric and neonatal patients.
AB  == emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative nosocomial pathogens has led to resurgence of colistin use. safety and efficacy data regarding colistin use in pediatric patients are sparse, while optimal dosage has not been defined. we present a case series of neonates and children without cystic fibrosis treated with various doses of colistin intravenously. the records of patients who received colistin in a tertiary-care hospital from january 2007 to march 2009 were reviewed. thirteen patients (median age 5 years, range 22 days to 14 years)  received 19 courses of colistin as treatment of pneumonia, central nervous system infection, bacteremia, or complicated soft tissue infection. the isolated pathogens were acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. daily dose  of colistin (colistimethate) ranged between 40,000 and 225,000 iu/kg. duration of administration ranged from 1 to 133 days. other antimicrobials were co-administered in 18/19 courses. increase of serum creatinine in one patient was associated with co-administration of colistin and gentamicin. sixteen of 19 courses had a favorable outcome, and only two of the three deaths were infection-related. colistin intravenous administration appears well tolerated even at higher than previously recommended doses and of prolonged duration.

TI  == in vitro activities of doripenem and other carbapenems against clinically important bacteria isolated in intensive care units: nationwide data from the smart programme.
AB  == this nationwide surveillance of clinically important bacteria from the intensive  care units (icus) of major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan investigated the  susceptibilities to doripenem and other comparator carbapenems from september through november 2005. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for 1,311 clinical isolates using the broth microdilution method according to clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) 2005 guidelines. doripenem showed similar (within four-fold difference of mics) in vitro activity to meropenem for enterobacteriaceae and probably comparable activity to meropenem against important nosocomial non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli (nfgnbs), including pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and burkholderia cepacia. among the four carbapenems analysed, doripenem and meropenem exhibited better in vitro activity than imipenem or ertapenem against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli isolates. however, the meropenem mic(90) against esbl-producing k. pneumoniae isolates was 2 microg/ml. besides, doripenem with the mic(90) of 0.5 microg/ml to streptococcus pneumoniae possibly suggested its potential therapeutic effect regarding community-acquired pneumonia. because of the heavy resistance burden in taiwan, closely monitoring the evolutionary trend of carbapenem susceptibilities  against clinically important pathogens is crucial in the future.

TI  == microbiological study of pathogenic bacteria isolated from paediatric wound infections following the 2008 wenchuan earthquake.
AB  == on 12 may 2008, the wenchuan earthquake struck in sichuan, china. within 1 month  after the earthquake, 98 injured children were admitted to the children's hospital of chongqing medical university. according to clinical manifestations, 50 children were diagnosed with wound infections. wound secretions were cultured  for bacteria. pathogen distribution and drug resistance were analyzed. a total of 99 pathogens were isolated; 16 (16%) were gram-positive bacteria and 81 (82%) were gram-negative bacteria. the distribution of pathogens isolated within 1 month after the earthquake was different to the distribution of pathogens in 546  general hospitalized cases in the y before the earthquake. the pathogens most frequently isolated 1 month after the earthquake were acinetobacter baumannii (27%), enterobacter cloacae (18%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%). the pathogens most frequently isolated in the y prior to the earthquake were escherichia coli (27%), staphylococcus aureus (23%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (9%). the rate of isolated drug-resistant bacteria was higher in the earthquake cases than  in the general hospitalized cases. in the cases injured in the earthquake, the rates of isolation of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. cloacae, e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were higher than in the cases from before the earthquake. multidrug-resistant and pandrug-resistant a. baumannii were isolated at a higher  rate in cases after the earthquake than in those before the earthquake. these changes in the spectrum of pathogens and in the drug resistance of the pathogens  isolated following an earthquake will provide the basis for emergency treatment after earthquakes.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms recovered at a military burn center.
AB  == infections caused by multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients with burn injuries. we performed  a 6-year antibiotic susceptibility records review from january 2003 to december 2008 to assess the prevalence of mdr isolates by pathogen at the us army institute of surgical research burn center. during the study period acinetobacter baumannii (780 isolates [22%]) was the most prevalent organism recovered, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (703 isolates [20%]), klebsiella pneumoniae (695 isolates [20%]), and staphylococcus aureus (469 isolates [13%]). mdr prevalence rates among these isolates were a. baumannii 53%, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) 34%, k. pneumoniae 17% and p. aeruginosa 15%. two isolates, 1 a. baumannii and 1 p. aeruginosa, were identified as resistant to all 4 classes of antibiotics tested plus colistin. a. baumannii isolates recovered from patients with burns greater than 30% of total body surface area (tbsa) were more likely to be mdr (61%) with no significant difference for p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae. a higher proportion of mdr p. aeruginosa isolates were recovered from respiratory specimens compared to blood specimens (24% vs. 9%) while the opposite was true for mrsa (35% vs. 54%). a comparison of a. baumannii recovered during hospitalization days 1-5 and 15-30 revealed higher mdr levels as length of stay increased (48% vs. 75%) while no significant trends were observed for p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae. a similar pattern was observed for mdr a. baumannii levels for the facility between 2003 and 2005 and 2006-2008 (39% vs. 70%), with no significant increase in mdr p. aeruginosa and mdr k. pneumoniae. increasing antibiotic resistance patterns of the most prevalent isolates recovered during extended hospitalization, impact of  % tbsa and other clinical parameters may affect empirical antimicrobial therapy and patient management decisions during treatment.

TI  == streptococcus pneumoniae coinfection is correlated with the severity of h1n1 pandemic influenza.
AB  == background: initial reports in may 2009 of the novel influenza strain h1n1pdm estimated a case fatality rate (cfr) of 0.6%, similar to that of seasonal influenza. in july 2009, however, argentina reported 3056 cases with 137 deaths,  representing a cfr of 4.5%. potential explanations for increased cfr included virus reassortment or genetic drift, or infection of a more vulnerable population. virus genomic sequencing of 26 argentinian samples representing both  severe and mild disease indicated no evidence of reassortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs, or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence. furthermore, no evidence was found for increased frequency of risk factors for h1n1pdm disease. methods/principal findings: we examined nasopharyngeal swab samples (nps) from 199 cases of h1n1pdm infection from argentina with masstag pcr, testing for 33 additional microbial agents. the  study population consisted of 199 h1n1pdm-infected subjects sampled between 23 june and 4 july 2009. thirty-nine had severe disease defined as death (n = 20) or hospitalization (n = 19); 160 had mild disease. at least one additional agent of  potential pathogenic importance was identified in 152 samples (76%), including streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 62); haemophilus influenzae (n = 104); human respiratory syncytial virus a (n = 11) and b (n = 1); human rhinovirus a (n = 1)  and b (n = 4); human coronaviruses 229e (n = 1) and oc43 (n = 2); klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2); acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2); serratia marcescens (n = 1); and staphylococcus aureus (n = 35) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa, n = 6). the presence of s. pneumoniae was strongly correlated with severe disease. s. pneumoniae was present in 56.4% of severe cases versus 25% of mild cases; more than one-third of h1n1pdm nps with s. pneumoniae were from subjects with severe disease (22 of 62 s. pneumoniae-positive nps, p = 0.0004). in subjects 6 to 55 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (or) of severe disease in the presence of s. pneumoniae was 125.5 (95% confidence interval [ci], 16.95, 928.72; p<0.0001).  conclusions/significance: the association of s. pneumoniae with morbidity and mortality is established in the current and previous influenza pandemics. however, this study is the first to demonstrate the prognostic significance of non-invasive antemortem diagnosis of s. pneumoniae infection and may provide insights into clinical management.

TI  == incidence and bacteriology of burn infections at a military burn center.
AB  == considerable advancements in shock resuscitation and wound management have extended the survival of burned patients, increasing the risk of serious infection. we performed a 6-year review of bacteria identification and antibiotic susceptibility records at the us army institute of surgical research burn center  between january 2003 and december 2008. the primary goal was to identify the bacteria recovered from patients with severe burns and determine how the bacteriology changes during extended hospitalization as influenced by population  and burn severity. a total of 460 patients were admitted to the burn icu with 3507 bacteria recovered from 13,727 bacteriology cultures performed. the most prevalent organisms recovered were acinetobacter baumannii (780), pseudomonas aeruginosa (703), klebsiella pneumoniae (695) and staphylococcus aureus (469). a. baumannii was most often recovered from combat-injured (58%) and s. aureus the most frequent isolate from local (46%) burn patients. culture recovery rate of a. baumannii and s. aureus was highest during the first 15 hospital days (73% and 71%); while a majority of p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae were recovered after day 15 (63% and 53%). all 4 pathogens were recovered throughout the course of hospitalization. a. baumannii was the most prevalent pathogen recovered from patients with total body surface area (tbsa) burns less than 30% (203) and 30-60% (338) while p. aeruginosa was most prevalent in patients with burns greater than  60% tbsa (292). shifting epidemiology of bacteria recovered during extended hospitalization, bacteriology differences between combat-injured and local burn patients, and impact of % tbsa may affect patient management decisions during the course of therapy.

TI  == colistin therapy for microbiologically documented multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections: a retrospective cohort study of 258 patients.
AB  == it is unclear whether the effectiveness of polymyxins depends on the site of infection, the responsible pathogen, dosage, and monotherapy vs. combination therapy. we investigated colistin therapy in a large, retrospective, single-centre, cohort study. primary analysis outcomes were infection outcome, survival and nephrotoxicity. over a 7-year period (october 2000 to october 2007), 258 patients received intravenous (i.v.) colistin for at least 72h for microbiologically documented multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections, comprising 170 (65.9%) acinetobacter baumannii, 68 (26.4%) pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 (7.0%) klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 (0.4%) stenotrophomonas maltophilia and 1 (0.4%) enterobacter cloacae. cure of infection occurred in 79.1% of patients, nephrotoxicity in 10% and hospital survival in 65.1%. in the multivariate analysis, independent predictors of survival were colistin average daily dose [adjusted odds ratio (aor)=1.22, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.05-1.42] and cure of infection (aor=9, 95% ci 3.6-23.1), whilst the proportion of creatinine change (aor=0.21, 95% ci 0.1-0.45), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) ii score (aor=0.89, 95% ci 0.84-0.95) and  haematological disease (aor=0.23, 95% ci 0.08-0.66) were associated with mortality. effectiveness of colistin was not dependent on the type of pathogen. no independent predictors for nephrotoxicity were observed. the findings of the largest cohort study to date on i.v. colistin show that colistin is a valuable antibiotic with acceptable nephrotoxicity and considerable effectiveness that depends on the daily dosage and infection site.

AB  == gram-negative bacteria (gnb) with multidrug resistance pose a serious threat to public health. they are environmental pathogens frequently isolated from raw milk and mastitis in dairy cattle. this study was to examine the in vitro antimicrobial activities against 225 isolates belonging to six important species  of gnb from mastitic raw milk samples of dairy herds in the republic of korea: acinetobacter baumannii (n = 17), citrobacter freundii (n = 19), enterobacter cloacae (n = 54), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 55), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 45), and serratia marcescens (n = 35). in general, amikacin, gentamicin, and piperacillin exhibited strong antimicrobial activities against all bacterial species tested, whereas rifampin, cephalothin, cefazolin, and ampicillin were ineffective against most of the bacterial species tested. wide differences were observed in the patterns of resistance among the bacterial species; in particular, resistance to kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol was highly variable among the strains belonging to different bacterial species. almost half of the gnb isolates (45.3%, 102/225) were resistant to 5 or more of 12 antimicrobial agents tested: p. aeruginosa (86.6%, 39/45) showed the highest resistance rate, followed by s. marcescens (65.7%, 23/35). this study indicates that multiple antimicrobial resistances are prevalent among gnb isolates from mastitic milk samples of dairy cattle in the republic of korea.

TI  == use of automated repetitive-sequence-based pcr for rapid laboratory confirmation  of nosocomial outbreaks.
AB  == objective: rapid and reliable diagnosis of genetic relatedness of clinical isolates in microbiologic laboratory is essential in case of nosocomial outbreak  investigation. most molecular techniques used to type microorganisms are technically demanding and time consuming. currently repetitive-sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) technique has been adapted to an automated format on the diversilab system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). aim of this study was to compare the performance of the diversilab system to that of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  (pfge) in nosocomial outbreaks. methods: 122 clinical isolates (28 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 26 acinetobacter baumannii, 45 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 esbl-producing klebsiella oxytoca) were investigated. 70 isolates originated from six well-documented outbreaks, 52 were non-outbreak isolates. results: concordant results for identification of outbreak and non-outbreak mrsa, a. baumannii and esbl-producing k. pneumoniae strains were achieved with both methods. in the outbreak of esbl-producing k. oxytoca automated rep-pcr was slightly more discriminatory than pfge. rep-pcr identified investigated esbl-producing k. oxytoca outbreak-strains as indistinguishable or closely related, showing similarity of >90%, while pfge identified these strains as indistinguishable. conclusion: automated rep-pcr assays on the diversilab system were used for mrsa, a. baumannii and for the first time esbl-producing klebsiella spp. and proved as  a rapid and reliable method for molecular analysis of nosocomial outbreaks.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  == background: in effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. methodology: the antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 35218, enterobacter aerogenes atcc 29751, e. aerogenes atcc 13048, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 and enterococcus hirae atcc 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. results: the crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). the most active plant extracts were  from dortenia picta and bridelia micrantha (mic: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from b. micrantha, mallotus oppositifolius, garcinia lucida, garcinia. kola, campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and c. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-positive cocci (mic: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). conclusion: of the 17 plant extracts studied,  seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. the stem bark of b. micrantha and the leaves of d. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli. this study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.

TI  == kinetic and theoretical study of the chalcones as inhibitors of beta-lactamase enzyme.
AB  == staphyloccoccus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and more bacteria have  shown resistance to antibiotics in colombia, therefore, resistance to antibiotics is a problem that is on increase in colombia. the resistance mechanism to penicillin antibiotics in these bacteria is the expression of beta-lactamase enzyme. in order to use the penicillin antibiotics which are still effective against them, we had evaluated 10 chalcones as inhibitors of this enzyme. the most active chalcone showed k(m') = 406.7 microm higher than clavulanic acid that showed k(m') = 211.9 microm at 37 degrees c during 10 h, and using amoxycillin as substrate. the chalcones were better competitive inhibitors because of they allowed the hydrolysis of smaller quantity of amoxycillin than the clavulanic acid, the most active chalcone showed k(cat)/k(m) = 1.398 (minm)(-1) and the clavulanic acid showed k(cat)/k(m) = 2.674 (minm)(-1). the molecular modelling of the enzyme-chalcones complexes showed that the chalcones with electron-donating groups on ortho, meta position of a ring favour the interaction with the residues threonine-319, lysine-67, serine-64 and tyrosine-150 of the active site of the enzyme, because of the number and strong of hydrogen bonds of the chalcones in the active site of the enzyme increase, and therefore the affinity of the chalcones increases too. the electron-donating groups in the chalcones contribute to their inductive effect improving the interaction with the active site of the enzyme because of rising of electrostatic attraction between them.

TI  == is there an association between nosocomial infection rates and bacterial cross transmissions?
AB  == objective: surveillance data of nosocomial infection rates are increasingly used  for public reporting and interhospital comparisons. approximately 15% of nosocomial infections on intensive care units are the result of patient-to-patient transmissions of the causative organisms. these exogenous infections could be prevented by adherence to basic infection control measures. the association between bacterial cross transmissions and nosocomial infection rates was analyzed. design: prospective cohort study during 24 months. setting: eleven intensive care units from two university hospitals. patients: all inpatients. interventions: none. measurements and main results: primary isolates  of six indicator organisms (acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus) cultured from clinical samples or methicillin-resistant s. aureus surveillance testing of all inpatients were genotyped. indistinguishable isolates in > or =2 patients defined potential episodes of transmissions. surveillance of nosocomial  infection rates was performed according to the german nosocomial infection surveillance system, krankenhaus infektions surveillance system. transmission events and nosocomial infection rates were pooled by intensive care unit to calculate spearman's rank-correlation test. during 100,781 patient days, 100,829  microbiological specimens from 24,362 patients were sampled (average investigation density: 1.0 sample per patient and day) and 3419 primary indicator organisms were cultured. altogether, 462 transmissions (incidence density of 4.6  transmissions per 1000 patient days; range, 1.4-8.4 days) and 1216 nosocomial infections (incidence density of 12.1 per 1000 patient days; range, 6.2-16.6 days) were discerned. correlation analysis was unable to reveal any association between the incidence of cross transmissions and nosocomial infections, duration  of hospitalization, or device use. conclusions: differences in nosocomial infection rates between study intensive care units are not explained solely by cross transmissions. other factors, like the severity of the patient's underlying diseases, the patient's endogenous flora, or invasive procedures, likely have a dominant effect on the magnitude of nosocomial infection rates.

TI  == antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of plants from northeast of mexico.
AB  == traditional medicine has a key role in health care worldwide. obtaining scientific information about the efficacy and safety of the plants from our region is one of the goals of our research group. in this report, 17 plants were  selected and collected in different localities from northeast mexico. the dried plants were separated into leaves, flowers, fruit, stems, roots and bark. each part was extracted with methanol, and 39 crude extracts were prepared. the extracts were tested for their antimicrobial activity using three gram-negative bacterial strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii), three gram-positive bacterial strains (enterococcus faecalis and two staphylococcus aureus strains), and seven clinically isolated yeasts (candida albicans, c. krusei, c. tropicalis, c. parapsilosis and c. glabrata); their antioxidant activity was tested using a dpph free radical assay. no activity against gram-negative bacteria was observed with any extract up to the maximum concentration tested, 1000 mug ml(-1). we report here for the first time activity of ceanothus coeruleus against s. aureus (flowers, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) 125 mug ml(-1)), c. glabrata (mics 31.25 mug ml(-1)) and c. parapsilosis (mics between 31.25 and 125 mug ml(-1)); chrysanctinia mexicana against c. glabrata (mics 31.25 mug ml(-1)); colubrina greggii against e. faecalis (mics 250 mug ml(-1)) and cordia boissieri against c. glabrata (mic 125 mug ml(-1)). furthermore, this is the first report about antioxidant activity of extracts from ceanothus coeruleus, chrysanctinia mexicana, colubrina greggii and cyperus alternifolius. some correlation could exist between antioxidant activity and antiyeast activity against yeasts in the species ceanothus coeruleus, schinus molle, colubrina greggii and cordia boissieri.

TI  == description of streptococcus pneumoniae infections in burn patients.
AB  == background: longer survival in burn patients has resulted in more infectious complications, typically with klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and staphylococcus aureus. although streptococcus pneumoniae infections are common in the community and can cause nosocomial infections, the incidence and risk factors for pneumococcal infections in burn patients is unclear. methods: we performed an electronic retrospective chart review to collect rates of and risk factors for s. pneumoniae infections in patients with thermal burns from march 2003 through june 2008. results: of the 1838 patients admitted to the burn center, 10 were infected (0.54% incidence). patients presented with pneumonia (seven patients, 0.38% incidence) and bacteremia (three patients, 0.16% incidence) within a week of initial burn (median 1 day, range 0-8), often in the setting of bacterial co-infection (five patients). this group was mainly young males with median 28.8% total body surface area burns; 60% had concomitant inhalational injury. most did not have traditional risk factors for pneumococcal infection but had objective signs of infection at time of positive culture and were treated with appropriate antibiotics. two patients in this series died, although no mortality was attributed to s. pneumoniae. conclusions: pneumococcal disease is not common in burn patients and generally occurs early on in hospitalization after burn making  it more likely to be a community-acquired pathogen rather than nosocomial in the  burn population. it should be considered in the setting of sepsis or new pulmonary infiltrates within a week after burn, but typical empiric antibiotics against the usual burn pathogens should be adequate to also treat for pneumococcal infection.

TI  == multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections: what are the treatment options?
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacilli creates a challenge in the treatment of nosocomial infections. while the pharmaceutical pipeline is waning, two revived old antibacterials (colistin and fosfomycin), a newer one (tigecycline) and an 'improved' member of an existing class (doripenem) are the only therapeutic options left. the class of polymyxins, known since 1947  and represented mostly by polymyxin b and polymyxin e (colistin), has recently gained a principal role in the treatment of the most problematic mdr gram-negative pathogens (such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia). future prospective studies are needed to answer important clinical questions, such as the possible benefit of combination with other antimicrobials versus monotherapy, the efficacy of colistin in neutropenic hosts and the role of inhaled colistin. as new pharmacokinetic data emerge, clarification of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) profile of colistin as well as appropriate dosing seems urgent, while development of resistance must be carefully monitored. fosfomycin tromethamine, a synthetic salt of fosfomycin discovered in 1969, has regained attention because of its in vitro activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae and mdr p. aeruginosa. although in use for decades in oral and parenteral formulations for a variety of infections without significant toxicity, its clinical utility in mdr infections remains to be explored in future studies. tigecycline, the first representative of the new class of glycylcyclines, holds promise in infections from mdr k. pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae carbapenemase [kpc]- and esbl-producing strains) and enterobacteriaceae with various mechanisms of resistance. the in vitro activity of tigecycline against a. baumannii makes it a tempting option, as it is currently the most active compound against mdr strains along with colistin. however, the usual minimum inhibitory concentration values of this pathogen are approximately 2 mg/l and compromise clinical outcomes based on pk/pd issues. its  advantageous penetration into various tissues is useful in infections of the skin and soft tissues as well as intra-abdominal infections (official indications), whereas low serum concentrations compromise its use in bloodstream infections. therefore, prospective studies with dose escalation are urgently needed, as well  as clarification of its role in nosocomial pneumonia, after poor results in the study of ventilator-associated pneumonia. finally, doripenem, the recently licensed member of the carbapenems (without significant spectrum alterations from the ascendant members) seems to possess a lower potential for resistance selection and a more favourable pharmacokinetic profile when given as an extended infusion. the latter strategy could prove helpful in overcoming low level resistance of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa strains.

TI  == the clinical consequences of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == the continued evolution of antimicrobial resistance in the hospital and more recently in the community threatens to seriously compromise our ability to treat  serious infections. the major success of the seven-valent streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine at reducing both infection and resistance has been followed by the emergence of previously minor serotypes that express multiresistance. the almost universal activity of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones against community escherichia coli strains has been compromised by the spread of ctx-m beta-lactamase-producing, fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, and the emergence of community-onset methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, particularly in the  united states, has forced us to re-think our empirical treatment guidelines for skin and soft-tissue infections. finally, our most potent and reliable class of antibiotics, the carbapenems, is compromised by the growth, primarily in intensive care units, of multiresistant klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanni, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the lack of a robust pipeline of new agents, particularly against resistant gram-negative bacteria, emphasizes the importance of optimizing our use of current antimicrobials and promoting strict adherence to established infection control practices.

TI  == oral care interventions and oropharyngeal colonization in children receiving mechanical ventilation.
AB  == background: recent progress in identification of oral microorganisms has shown that the oropharynx can be a site of origin for dissemination of pathogenic organisms to distant body sites, such as the lungs. objective: to compare the oropharyngeal microbiological profile, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of stay in the intensive care unit of children receiving mechanical ventilation who had pharmacological or nonpharmacological oral care. methods: a randomized and controlled study was performed in a pediatric intensive unit in sao paulo, brazil. a total of 56 children were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n=27, 48%) that received oral care with use of 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate or a control group (n=29, 52%) that received oral care  without an antiseptic. oropharyngeal secretions were collected and cultured on days 0, 2, and 4, and at discharge. results: the 2 groups had similar demographic characteristics, preexisting underlying diseases, and pharmacological, nutritional, and ventilatory support. gram-negative bacteria were the predominant pathogens: acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enter-obacter species. the 2 groups did not differ significantly  in the colonization of normal (p= .72) or pathogenic (p= .62) flora, in the duration of mechanical ventilation (p= .67), or in length of stay in the intensive care (p= .22). conclusion: use of chlorhexidine combined with nonpharmacological oral care did not decrease the colonization profile, duration  of mechanical ventilation, or length of stay in critically ill children receiving mechanical ventilation.

TI  == bacterial contamination of patients' medical charts in a surgical ward and the intensive care unit: impact on nosocomial infections.
AB  == background and purpose: the purpose of this study was to determine the degree of  bacterial contamination of patients' files, and to compare the colonized bacteria between files from the surgical intensive care unit (icu) and the surgical ward at the wan fang hospital, taipei, taiwan. methods: 180 medical charts were randomly selected from the surgical icu (n = 90) and the surgical ward (n = 90).  the charts were sampled using sterile swabs moistened with sterile normal saline. the swabs were immediately transferred to trypticase soy broth and incubated aerobically for 48 h, then subcultured to separated sheep blood and eosin-methylene blue agars. microorganisms were identified by the standard methods used in the microbiological laboratory. results: ninety percent of charts in the surgical icu (n = 81) and 72.2% in the surgical ward (n = 65) were contaminated with pathogenic or potentially pathogenic bacteria (p = 0.0023). coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) were the most commonly isolated bacteria, both in the surgical icu (n = 40, 44.44%) and in the surgical ward (n = 48, 53.33%). several bacteria isolated from the charts, including multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and klebsiella pneumoniae, had the same antibiogram as the same bacteria isolated from patients. conclusion: this study showed that the patients' charts in the icu were usually contaminated  with pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria. contaminated charts can serve as a source for cross-infection. health care personnel should wash their hands before and after contact with the chart to reduce the nosocomial infection  rate.

TI  == catheter-related urinary tract infection in patients suffering from spinal cord injuries.
AB  == urinary tract infection is commoner in patients with spinal cord injuries because of incomplete bladder emptying and the use of catheters that can result in the introduction of bacteria into the bladder. 145 patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, admitted to the institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation, centre for paraplegia of the clinical centre of the university of sarajevo, were included. the patients were divided in three groups according to the method of bladder drainage: group a (n=61) consisted of patients on clean intermittent catheterization; group b (n=54) consisted of patients with indwelling catheters; group c (n=30) consisted of patients who had performed self-catheterization. from a total of 4539 urine samples, 3963 (87,3%) were positive and 576 (12,7%) were sterile. more than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic. the overall rate of urinary infection amounted to about 2,1 episodes, and bacteriuria to 8,1 episodes per patient. 77% of infections (113/145) were acquired within seven days from catheterization. infection was usually polymicrobial; the greatest number of urine samples 1770/3943 (44,9%) included more than one bacterium. the vast majority of cases of urinary tract infection and bacteriuria are caused by gram-negative bacilli and enterococci, commensal organisms of the bowel and perineum, representative of those from the hospital environment. providencia stuarti (18,9%) being the most common, followed by proteus mirabilis (16,3%), escherichia coli (11,8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10,2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8,1%), morganella morgani (5,4%), acinetobacter baumannii (4,6%), providencia rettgeri (3,5%). 15,7% of isolates were gram-positive with enterococcus faecalis (8,6%) as the most common. 55,3% of isolates were multidrug-resistant, and the highest rates of resistance were found among acinetobacter baumannii (87,8%), providencia rettgeri (86,7%), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (85,4%), providencia stuarti (84,3%) and morganella morgani (81,0%). lower rates of resistance were found in group c, i.e. patients on intermittent self-catheterisation. eradication of organisms was achieved in only 53 (10,05%) of patients; hence, antibiotic therapy had no or very low effect. significant correlations were found between the method of catheterization and the frequency of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections. the analysis of group c showed a rate of lower urinary tract infection and bacteriuria than the other two groups of patients. the objective of this study is the update of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in urinary tract infections in this group of patients. in addition, possible correlations between uti and the type of bladder  management were examined.

TI  == tigecycline in combination with other antimicrobials: a review of in vitro, animal and case report studies.
AB  == tigecycline has been investigated in combination with other antibacterials against a wide range of susceptible and multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. combinations have been analysed in vitro, in animal models and in human case reports. in vitro, tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials produces primarily an indifferent response (neither synergy nor antagonism). nevertheless, synergy occurred when tigecycline was combined with rifampicin against 64-100% of enterococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacter spp. and brucella melitensis isolates. combinations of tigecycline with amikacin also showed synergy for 40-100% of enterobacter spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus spp. and stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. moreover, bactericidal synergisms occurred with tigecycline plus amikacin against problematic acinetobacter baumannii and proteus vulgaris, and with colistin against k. pneumoniae. data from animal experiments and case reports, although limited, displayed consistent beneficial activity of tigecycline in combination with other antibacterials against multiresistant organisms, including vancomycin  against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae in experimental meningitis, gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental pneumonia, daptomycin against enterococcus faecium endocarditis, and colistin against k. pneumoniae bacteraemia and p. aeruginosa osteomyelitis. antagonism was extremely rare in vitro and was not reported in vivo. thus, tigecycline may be combined with a second antimicrobial as part of a combination regimen.

TI  == [resistance to newer beta-lactams and related esbl types in gram-negative nosocomial isolates in turkish hospitals: results of the multicentre hitit study].
AB  == increasing resistance due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and multiple resistance mechanisms in gram-negative hospital isolates restrict the role of beta-lactam antibiotics in empirical treatment of serious infections. as  the prevalence of esbl producing strains and resistance rates to antimicrobial agents can vary in each center, local surveillance studies are required to guide  therapy. in this study, in vitro rates of resistance to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam were evaluated in 1196 gram-negative hospital isolates in a multicenter in vitro study with the participation of six different centers in turkey between the period of june 2004-january 2005. the isolates included escherichia coli (n= 457), klebsiella pneumoniae (n= 390), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 194) and acinetobacter boumannii (n= 155). in addition, frequency of esbl production and types of enzymes were determined in blood isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae. mics and  esbl production were investigated by e-test (ab biodisk, solna) and the results were evaluated by using clsi breakpoints. pcr analysis was used for typing of the esbls. in e. coli, 26% and in k. pneumoniae 32% of the isolates were esbl producers. among the blood isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, 31.7% and 33.3% produced esbls, respectively. ctx-m (71.4%) was the most prevalent enzyme, followed by tem (49.4%) and shv (46.7%) derived enzymes. ctx-m-15 (69.4%) was the most frequent ctx-m type in blood isolates followed by ctx-m-3 (28.6%) and ctx-m-1 (2%). resistance to imipenem was not observed in e. coli isolates, however it was 1.3% in k. pneumoniae, 28.9% in p. aeruginosa and 52.2% in a. baumannii strains. resistance to cefoperazone/sulbactam was found as 6%, 17.7%, 27.9% and 41.3% in e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates, respectively, whereas resistance rates to piperacillin/tazobactam were  10.2%, 22.3%, 22.7% and 78.7%, respectively. these results indicate that esbl production and rates of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics are high in hospital isolates of gram-negative bacteria in turkey, however, they show variations in different hospitals and ctx-m enzymes are prevalent in these isolates.

TI  == microarray of dna-protein complexes on poly-3-hydroxybutyrate surface for pathogen detection.
AB  == a novel strategy was developed for the specific immobilization of dna probes on poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (phb) surface by using the substrate-binding domain (sbd)  of phb depolymerase as an active binding motif. to demonstrate whether this method can be used for the detection of clinical pathogens, the pathogen-specific biotin-labeled dna probes were immobilized via core streptavidin (csa) fused to the sbd. the pathogen-specific 15-mer oligonucleotide probes were designed for four model pathogens, while the target dnas were prepared by pcr using universal  primers. the complex of pathogen-specific probes and csa-sbd fusion protein was immobilized on the phb-coated slide by microspotting. this dna-protein complex microarray was able to successfully diagnose acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. furthermore, the specific pathogens could be diagnosed in the presence of other microorganisms. thus, the dna-protein complex microarray platform technology employing phb and the sbd reported here can be widely used for the detection of dna-dna and dna-biomolecule interactions without synthetic or chemical modification of biomolecules or solid surface.

TI  == metallo-beta-lactamases in gram-negative bacteria: introducing the era of pan-resistance?
AB  == metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) are being reported with increasing frequency and from several countries worldwide and are becoming the prevalent and most clinically significant determinants of carbapenem resistance. furthermore, mbl-producing strains that exhibit a pan-resistant phenotype are increasingly detected. initially mbls were detected in pseudomonas aeruginosa, however nowadays they are frequently found in acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae and other enterobacteriaceae. mbls spread easily on plasmids and cause nosocomial infections and outbreaks with excess mortality. such infections mainly concern patients admitted to intensive care units with several co-morbidities and a history of prolonged administration of antibiotics. mbl-producing strains exhibit resistance to almost all currently available antibiotics. in vitro studies reveal that tigecycline and colistin are the only antibacterial agents with consistent activity against mbl-producing strains. randomised controlled trials are required in order to evaluate the available therapeutic regimens, including treatment combinations. tigecycline and colistin should be used under appropriate prescribing practices. surveillance to monitor the emergence of resistance to these agents as well as implementation of infection control measures should be strengthened. mbl inhibitors are urgently needed, however, none is in late pre-clinical development.

TI  == comparative pharmacodynamics for intravenous antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria in europe between 2002 and 2006: a report from the optama program.
AB  == the optimizing pharmacodynamic target attainment using the mystic antibiogram (optama) program has been used globally to estimate antimicrobial exposures for either targeted pathogens or disease states. herein, we utilised this methodology to determine antimicrobial exposures of cefepime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam against european-derived isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa obtained in 2006 and compared these with results from 2002. all regimens, except ciprofloxacin, provided optimal pharmacodynamic exposures against e. coli, whereas more regional differences were noted with k. pneumoniae. for k. pneumoniae, the carbapenems provided the highest likelihood of optimal exposures. ciprofloxacin exposures were also noted to be low for both p.  aeruginosa and a. baumannii. moreover, for these two organisms higher doses and/or prolonged infusion of the studied beta-lactams was necessary to obtain the desired pharmacodynamic targets. these data reveal regional differences in the probability of pharmacodynamic optimisation as well as the potential utility of employing regimens utilising higher doses and/or prolonged infusion techniques when directing therapy against p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii.

TI  == antimicrobial drug resistance in taiwan.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide, but marked variations in the resistance profiles of bacterial pathogens are found between countries and in different patient settings, especially in asia. in taiwan, the strikingly high prevalence of resistance to macrolides and streptogramins in clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria correlates with the widespread use of these agents in the medical and farming communities. the relatively low proportion of enterococci that are resistant to glycopeptides does not equate to  the high use of glycopeptides and extended-spectrum beta-lactams in hospitals. the emerging problem of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates is substantial, and some unique enzymes have been found. recently, gram-negative bacteria (e.g. pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii) that are resistant to nearly all available antimicrobial agents, including carbapenems, have emerged.

TI  == ertapenem for treatment of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteraemia.
AB  == introduction: imipenem and meropenem are treatment of choice for extended-spectrum betalactamase (esbl)-positive gram-negative bacteraemia. they may select for carbapenemresistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa; ertapenem may not do so as it is inactive against these bacteria. clinical efficacy of ertapenem in esbl-producing gramnegative bacteraemia is limited. materials and methods: retrospective study of patients with esbl-positive gram-negative bacteraemia treated with ertapenem was undertaken. results: forty-seven patients with multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteraemia  (79% produced esbl) were treated with ertapenem for a median duration of 11 days. the median age was 70 years. septic shock occurred in 19% and mechanical ventilation was needed in 17%. klebsiella pneumoniae comprised 53% and escherichia coli 26%. urinary infection accounted for 61% and hepatobiliary 15%.  favourable clinical response occurred in 96%. attributable mortality was 4%. conclusion: ertapenem is promising in culture-guided step-down therapy of esbl-positive gram-negative bacteraemia.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacilli: a singapore perspective.
AB  == introduction: antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacilli is an area of increasing importance. this prospective study was performed to survey antibiotic  resistance in escherichia coli (e. coli), klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. over a 1-year period. materials and methods: non-duplicate isolates of e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. were collected from participating singapore hospitals during defined collection periods in 2006 and 2007. confirmatory identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing were performed at changi general hospital. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) to a defined panel of antibiotics were determined using microbroth dilution methods. the presence of extended-spectrum beta lactamases and ampc beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae was determined by phenotypic methods, and susceptibility results were defined using current breakpoints from the clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi). results: seven hundred and forty-six gram-negative bacilli were received for testing. resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was present in a third of enterobacteriaceae isolates, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) carriage was present in 19.6% and 30.1% of e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. ampc enzymes were also detected in 8.5% and 5.6% of e. coli and k.  pneumoniae isolates respectively. all enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. the most active antibiotics against p. aeruginosa were amikacin, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. a third of p. aeruginosa showed  reduced susceptibility to polymyxin b. carbapenem resistance was significantly higher in acinetobacter baumannii (70.5%) than in other acinetobacter species (25.0%). the most active antibiotic against a. baumannii was polymyxin b. conclusion: antibiotic resistance is prevalent in gram-negative bacilli isolated  from singapore hospitals. the mic testing surveillance programme complemented susceptibility data from wider laboratory-based surveillance, and has revealed emerging mechanisms of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == [nationwide susceptibility surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antimicrobials against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--third ciproxan injection special survey (2005)].
AB  == we conducted 3 nationwide surveillance studies between 2001 and 2005 at 39 participating institutions throughout japan according to the special survey plan  to investigate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and various parenteral antimicrobials using clinical isolates from patients with severe infection during the reexamination period of parenteral cpfx. results of the first special survey  (2001) were already reported in this journal. the current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout japan to determine susceptibility to cpfx and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between january and june 2005. the results of cpfx in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. the minimum inhibitory concentration of cpfx at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (mic90) ranged from < or =0.063 to 2 microg/ml for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella spp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., serratia marcescens, and acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. however, the cpfx-susceptibility rate of escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. for morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mic90 of cpfx tended to increase with time. the cpfx-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for p. aeruginosa and 67.9% for stenotrophomonas maltophilia. with the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of  respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for cpfx, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. these susceptibility rates for cpfx were similar to the rates for cefozopran and  imipenem. these values generally indicated favorable cpfx susceptibility testing  results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of cpfx particularly against gram-negative bacteria. further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of e. coli, m. morganii, and p. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time.

TI  == emergence of extensively drug-resistant and pandrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli in europe.
AB  == international and local surveillance networks as well as numerous reports in the  biomedical literature provide evidence that the prevalence of antibiotic resistant gram-negative bacteria is escalating in many european countries. furthermore, isolates characterised as multidrug-resistant (i.e. resistant to three or more classes of antimicrobials), extensively drug resistant (i.e. resistant to all but one or two classes) or pandrug-resistant (i.e. resistant to  all available classes) are increasingly frequently isolated in hospitalised patients causing infections for which no adequate therapeutic options exist. acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae are specifically addressed in this review as the most problematic and often extensively or pandrug-resistant pathogens. according to the available multicentre surveillance studies, the proportion of imipenem-resistant a. baumannii strains is reported to be as high as 85% in bloodstream isolates from intensive care unit patients in greece and 48% in clinical isolates from hospitalised patients in spain and turkey. among 33 european countries participating in the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (earss) in 2007, six countries reported carbapenem resistance rates of more than  25% among p. aeruginosa isolates, the highest rate reported from greece (51%). according to earss, greece has also the highest resistance rates among k. pneumoniae; 46% to carbapenems, 58% to quinolones and 63% to third generation cephalosporins. this review describes the magnitude of antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative bacteria in europe highlighting where the efforts of the scientific communities, the academia, the industry and the government should focus in order to confront this threat.

TI  == a study on nosocomial pathogens in icu with special reference to multiresistant acinetobacter baumannii harbouring multiple plasmids.
AB  == background & objectives: antibiotic resistant bacterial nosocomial infections are a leading problem in intensive care units (icu). present investigation was undertaken to know antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter baumannii and some other pathogens obtained from clinical samples from icu causing nosocomial infections. special emphasis was given on plasmid mediated transferable antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter. methods: the clinical specimens obtained  from icu, were investigated to study distribution of nosocomial pathogens (272) and their antibiotic resistance profile. acinetobacter isolates were identified by api2one system. antimicrobial resistance was studied with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) by double dilution agar plate method. the plasmid profile of  26 antibiotic resistant isolates of acinetobacter was studied. curing of r-plasmids was determined in three antibiotic resistant plasmid containing a. baumannii isolates. plasmid transfer was studied by transformation. results: major infections found in icu were due to acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. the infection rate was maximum in urinary tract (44.4%) followed by wound infections (29.4%), pneumonia (10.7%) and bronchitis (7.4%). acinetobacter isolates displayed high level of antibiotic resistance (up to 1024microg/ml) to most of antibiotics. more than 90 per cent isolates of acinetobacter were resistant to a minimum of 23 antibiotics. plasmid profile of acinetobacter isolates showed presence of 1-4 plasmids. ethidium bromide cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281, pupi282 with curing efficiencies 20, 16 and 11 per cent respectively while acridine orange cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281 with curing efficiencies 7 and 18 per cent retrospectively. transformation frequency of e. coli hb101 with pupi281 was 4.3 x 10(4) transformants/microg plasmid dna. interpretation & conclusions: a. baumannii was found to be associated with urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, septicaemia, bacteraemia, meningitis and wound infections. a. baumannii displayed higher resistance to more number of antibiotics than other nosocomial pathogens from icu. antibiotic sensitivity of a. baumannii cured isolates confirmed plasmid borne nature of antibiotic resistance markers. transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids from acinetobacter to other nosocomial pathogens can create complications in the treatment of the patient. therefore, it is very important to target acinetobacter which is associated with nosocomial infections.

TI  == the effect of limiting antimicrobial therapy duration on antimicrobial resistance in the critical care setting.
AB  == background: using antimicrobial agents for prolonged periods of time and/or in heavy densities is known to contribute to antimicrobial resistance. methods: a quasiexperimental, before and after study to limit the duration of antimicrobial  therapy to 14 days was conducted in a medical-surgical intensive care unit (icu). an intervention to optimize antimicrobial therapy was performed when antimicrobial agents had been prescribed for more than 14 days. we then compared  antimicrobial utilization using the defined daily dose (ddd) per 1000 patient-days, as well as resistance rates in selected organisms in the intervention phase to the previous 10-month period. results: in the intervention  phase, doctors approved to discontinue the antimicrobial therapy before 14 days in 89.8% (415/462) of the prescribed antibiotics in the icu. comparing the 2 time periods, we found a reduction in carbapenems (24.5% decrease), vancomycin (14.3%  decrease), and cephalosporins (12.2% decrease) in the intervention phase. imipenem resistance decreased in acinetobacter baumannii from 88.5% to 20.0% (p <or= .001) and in klebsiella pneumoniae from 54.5% to 10.7% (p = .01). conclusion: these results suggest that an intervention to reduce the duration of  antimicrobial therapy contributed to more rational use of antimicrobial agents and to the reduction of bacterial resistance in the critical care setting.

AB  == sitafloxacin hydrate (du-6859a, gracevit), a new-generation, broad-spectrum oral  fluoroquinolone that is very active against many gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic clinical isolates, including strains resistant to other fluoroquinolones, was recently approved in japan for the treatment of respiratory and urinary tract infections. sitafloxacin is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococci with reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin and other quinolones and enterococci. sitafloxacin has also demonstrated activity against clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (including about 67% of strains producing extended-spectrum, beta-lactamases and resistant to ciprofloxacin), enterobacter  cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa with some activity against quinolone-resistant strains and acinetobacter baumannii. the in vitro activity against anaerobes is comparable to imipenem or metronidazole. in a published phase ii randomized, open-label, multicenter study of patients hospitalized with pneumonia, sitafloxacin (400 mg once daily) was comparable to imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg three times a day). results of the phase iii trials of sitafloxacin are not available in english. the clinical safety profile of sitafloxacin has been characterized from 1,059 patients who participated in 10 clinical trials. the most common events with 50 or 100 mg twice daily were gastrointestinal disorders  (17.2%), mostly diarrhea, and abnormal laboratory test results (16.2%), mostly liver enzyme elevations. for japanese patients, sitafloxacin provides the broad-spectrum coverage promised by clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin and comparable to carbapenems. while it is currently limited by its potential for phototoxicity in caucasians, phototoxicity is essentially irrelevant if sitafloxacin is used in hospitals and especially in intensive care units.

TI  == impact of antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacilli on empirical and definitive antibiotic therapy.
AB  == serious infections with gram-negative pathogens continue to be associated with considerable mortality. increasing antibiotic resistance in organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae is contributing to difficulties with choosing antibiotics to prescribe for these infections. optimization of therapy against these organisms starts with the initial empirical antibiotic choice. surveillance data and hospital or unit antibiograms may inform this decision, although individualization of the initial  regimen on the basis of prior antibiotic use and prior isolation of resistant pathogens may be more important. combinations of antibiotics are often required empirically, and "combination antibiograms" may need to be developed for this purpose. preliminary data suggest that extending the time over which a dose of antipseudomonal beta-lactam antibiotics is infused may improve clinical outcomes; however, this idea remains to be confirmed in randomized trials. the role of direct susceptibility testing in aiding more-rapid initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is also being studied. when identification and susceptibility  testing is complete, the antibiotic regimen for infections due to gram-negative pathogens can be "fine tuned." on some occasions, this fine tuning necessitates the introduction of "salvage" antibiotics, such as colistin or tigecycline; on others, it necessitates de-escalation and early termination of therapy. the lack  of new antibiotic options against gram-negative pathogens underscores the need for optimization of current therapies and prevention of the spread of these organisms.

AB  == we describe the characteristics and outcome of pandrug-resistant (pdr) gram-negative bacterial infections (23 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 3 pseudomonas aeruginosa and 3 acinetobacter baumannii) of hospitalised patients at a tertiary-care centre (1 january 2006-31 may 2007). the site of infection was central venous catheter-related in 5 of 24 patients with clinical infection, bacteraemia in 5, the respiratory system in 5, surgical site in 5, the urinary system in 2, the ascitic fluid in 1 and the central nervous system in one. twenty of 24 patients with infection received an antibiotic regimen containing colistin  (in combination with meropenem in 8 patients). the overall in-hospital mortality  was 41.7% (10/24); 8 patients died because of the pdr infection (infection-related mortality 33.3%). significant co-morbidity was present not only in the patients who died but also in survivors. pdr gram-negative bacterial  infections are associated with considerable mortality, although not as high as expected given the fact that the isolates were resistant to all tested antibiotics, including polymyxins. antibiotics that are ineffective in vitro may  prove life-saving for some of these patients, especially combination regimens containing colistin.

TI  == [in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiple resistant acinetobacter baumannii and carbapenem resistant klebsiella pneumoniae isolates].
AB  == in order to detect the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiple resistant gram-negative bacilli isolated in our hospital, tigecycline susceptibilities of clinical isolates of multiple and/or panresistant 100 acinetobacter baumannii isolates, and 38 carbapenem resistant klebsiella pneumoniae (17 of which were panresistant), obtained between january 2005 and august 2007, were evaluated by using e-test (ab biodisc, sweden). carbapenem resistance rate was found to be 59% for a.baumannii, using vitek2 compact system  (bio-merieux, france) which is present in our laboratory for routine use. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) levels for tigecycline were < or =2 mcg/ml in 93%  of the isolates while the mic level was 3 mcg/ml for 7% of the isolates. tigecycline mic50 and mic 90 values were 1.5 and 2 mcg/ml, respectively. among k. pneumoniae the least resistance was detected against amikacin (52.6% resistant) while tigecycline mic levels were between 0.13 mcg/ml and 2 mcg/ml. all of the k.pneumoniae strains were susceptible to tigecycline, and the mic50 ve mic90 values of these isolates were 1 mcg/ml and 1.5 mcg/ml, respectively. the in vitro susceptibility rates of tigecycline against multiple and/or panresistant a. baumannii and k. pneumoniae isolates are found to be promising for use in therapy.

TI  == a phase 3, open-label, non-comparative study of tigecycline in the treatment of patients with selected serious infections due to resistant gram-negative organisms including enterobacter species, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella  pneumoniae.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tigecycline in patients with selected serious infections caused by resistant gram-negative bacteria, or failures who had received prior antimicrobial therapy or were unable to tolerate  other appropriate antimicrobials. secondary objectives included an evaluation of  the microbiological efficacy of tigecycline and in vitro activity of tigecycline  for resistant gram-negative bacteria. methods: this open-label, phase 3, non-comparative, multicentre study assessed the efficacy and safety of intravenous tigecycline (100 mg initially, then 50 mg 12 hourly for 7-28 days) in hospitalized patients with serious infections including complicated intra-abdominal infection; complicated skin and skin structure infection (csssi); community-acquired pneumonia (cap); hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia; or bacteraemia, including catheter-related bacteraemia. all patients had infections due to resistant gram-negative organisms, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains, or had failed on prior therapy or could not receive (allergy or intolerance) one or more agents from three classes of commonly used antibiotics. the primary efficacy endpoint was clinical response in the microbiologically evaluable (me) population at test of cure (toc). safety data included vital signs, laboratory tests and adverse events (aes). results: in the me population at toc, the clinical cure rate was 72.2% [95% confidence interval (ci): 54.8-85.8], and the microbiological eradication rate was 66.7% (95% ci: 13.7-78.8). the most commonly isolated resistant gram-negative pathogens were acinetobacter baumannii (47%), escherichia coli (25%), klebsiella pneumoniae (16.7%) and enterobacter spp. (11.0%); the most commonly diagnosed serious infection was csssi (67%). the most common treatment-emergent aes were nausea (29.5%), diarrhoea (16%) and vomiting (16%), which were mild or moderate in severity. conclusions: in this non-comparative study, tigecycline appeared safe and efficacious in patients with difficult-to-treat serious infections caused by resistant gram-negative organisms.

TI  == differential correlation between rates of antimicrobial drug consumption and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in a tertiary care hospital in greece.
AB  == objective: to investigate whether there is a correlation between the rates of antimicrobial drug consumption in hospital departments and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among clinically important bacteria recovered in the hospital. design: retrospective study. setting: tertiary care hospital in greece. methods: data on antimicrobial consumption (from january 2001 through december 2004) were expressed as defined daily doses per 100 bed-days. the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterococcus faecium recovered during the same time period were calculated by the microbiology department. we then performed the following analyses: (1) a comparison of the consumption rates for different antimicrobial groups in individual hospital departments, (2) a comparison of the prevalence of resistance to different antimicrobials, and (3) a correlation analysis of antimicrobial consumption rates and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. results: the rates of antimicrobial consumption and the prevalence of resistance varied substantially among the hospital's departments. the annual rate of consumption for carbapenems  correlated with the rate of consumption for glycopeptides and third-generation cephalosporins (p < .05). among p. aeruginosa isolates, the prevalence of imipenem resistance correlated with the prevalence of resistance to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime (p < .05). the rate of carbapenem consumption correlated with the prevalence of imipenem resistance among p. aeruginosa and a.  baumannii isolates (p < .05). the rate of aminoglycoside consumption correlated with the prevalence of amikacin resistance among p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli isolates (p < .05). however, the rate of consumption for fluoroquinolones and glycopeptides had no correlation with the prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance among gram-negative bacteria or vancomycin resistance among e. faecium isolates. conclusions: these data are suggestive of a differential relationship between antimicrobial consumption and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among various species and for various antimicrobial agents. these findings may help to optimize antimicrobial prescription policies in the hospital, especially in departments that have both high rates of antimicrobial consumption and a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == epidemiology of bacteremia episodes in a single center: increase in gram-negative isolates, antibiotics resistance, and patient age.
AB  == increased resistance among isolates causing bacteremia constitutes a major challenge to medical practitioners and institutions. variability between institutes is substantial, and requires the individual analysis of local trends.  an eight-year (1997-2004) surveillance study of episodes of bacteremia was conducted in an 850-bed university hospital in central israel. trends of incidence, resistance, age, and mortality were analyzed. we studied 6,096 patient-unique episodes of bacteremia, of which, 2,722 (45.3%) were nosocomial and 523 (9.2%) involved children less than 18 years of age. the overall incidence of bacteremia episodes has increased over the study years by 39% and the patient  mean age by 7.5 years. gram-negative organisms accounted for 72% of hospital-acquired cases and 69% of community-acquired cases. there was a substantial increase in the incidence of nosocomial episodes, predominantly due to gram-negative isolates, mainly acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. increased resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics was noted among gram-negative organisms, including quinolones (in k. pneumoniae), imipenem (a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa), piperacillin-tazobactam (k. pneumoniae), and amikacin (a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa). increased resistance  to oxacillin among coagulase-negative staphylococci was also noted. the all-cause mortality rates showed a significant rise. the patient age, intensive care unit (icu) stay, and hospital acquisition were independently associated with mortality. we describe an increase in the incidence and resistance of gram-negative organisms causing bacteremia and concomitant ageing of the patients with bacteremia. similar patterns have been reported from other localities, and are of real concern.

TI  == imported per-1 producing pseudomonas aeruginosa, per-1 producing acinetobacter baumanii and vim-2-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in hungary.
AB  == introduction: pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumanii are important nosocomial pathogens with wide intrinsic resistance. however, due to the dissemination of the acquired resistance mechanisms, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) and metallo beta-lactamase (mbl) production, multidrug resistant strains have been isolated more often. case presentation: we report a case of a hungarian tourist, who was initially hospitalized in egypt and later transferred to hungary. on the day of admission per-1-producing p. aeruginosa, per-1 producing a. baumannii, shv-5-producing klebsiella pneumoniae and vim-2-producing p. aeruginosa isolates were subcultured from the patient's samples in hungary. comparing the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) patterns of the p. aeruginosa strains from the patient to the p. aeruginosa strains occurring in this hospital, we can state that the per-1-producing p. aeruginosa and vim-2-producing p. aeruginosa had external origin. conclusion: this is the first report of per-1-producing p. aeruginosa,and per-1-producing a.  baumanii strains in hungary. this case highlights the importance of spreading of  the beta-lactamase-mediated resistance mechanisms between countries and continents, showing the importance of careful screening and the isolation of patients arriving from a different country.

TI  == a convenient microbiological assay employing cell-free extracts for the rapid characterization of gram-negative carbapenemase producers.
AB  == objectives: the dissemination of metallo and serine carbapenem-hydrolysing beta-lactamases among gram-negative nosocomial bacteria represents an acute problem worldwide. here, we present a rapid and sensitive assay for the characterization of carbapenemase producers to aid in infection control and prevention. methods: the assay involves a rapid disruption of bacterial isolates  with silicon dioxide microbeads, followed by the testing in cell-free extracts of hydrolytic activity towards various beta-lactams including two carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) and a cephalosporin (ceftazidime). a parallel testing of the effects of selective beta-lactamase inhibitors such as edta and clavulanic acid allows differentiation of metallo carbapenemases from serine carbapenemases, and also clavulanic-acid-sensitive from -resistant enzymes among the latter. results: the efficiency of bacterial disruption using silicon dioxide microbeads  was identical to that of ultrasonic treatment. the subsequent microbiological assay aimed to evaluate both substrate specificity and inhibitor profile of carbapenem-hydrolysing enzymes present in the extracts and allowed an accurate differentiation of a, b and d types, as judged by the analysis of 24 well-characterized clinical strains that included metallo-beta-lactamase producers (i.e. vim-, imp- and spm-type pseudomonas producers; an l1 stenotrophomonas maltophilia producer; and a gob-18 elizabethkingia meningoseptica producer) as well as serine carbapenemase producers (i.e. an sme-type serratia marcescens producer, a ges-2 pseudomonas aeruginosa producer, klebsiella pneumoniae and citrobacter freundii kpc-2 producers and oxa-type acinetobacter baumannii producers). conclusions: we have developed a convenient microbiological assay aimed to more accurately and in a short time characterize carbapenem-hydrolysing enzymes produced by gram-negative bacteria. the assay possesses broad applicability in the clinical setting.

TI  == risk factors associated with the isolation of colistin-resistant gram-negative bacteria: a matched case-control study.
AB  == objective: the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria has led to the re-use of colistin, but resistance to this agent has already been reported. we aimed to investigate the potential risk factors for the isolation of colistin-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa from hospitalized patients. design: matched case-control study. setting: tertiary care hospital in athens, greece. patients: case patients were those who had provided a clinical specimen from which a colistin-resistant k. pneumoniae, a. baumannii, or p. aeruginosa was isolated. controls were selected from a pool of patients who had susceptible to colistin isolates and were matched (1:1) to cases for species of microorganism and site of isolation. susceptibility to colistin was determined with the etest. interventions: none. measurements and main results: data regarding patient demographics, comorbidities, admission to the intensive care unit, prior antibiotic use, and invasive procedures performed were analyzed as risk factors in a matched bivariable model. variables significantly associated with colistin-resistant isolates (p < .05) were entered in a backward multivariable logistic regression model. forty-one colistin-resistant unique patient isolates were identified from  january 1, 2006, until march 31, 2007. these isolates represented infection in 35 of 41 patients. risk factors significantly associated with the isolation of colistin-resistant isolates were age, duration of intensive care unit stay, [corrected] surgical procedures, use of colistin, use of monobactams, duration of use of colistin and duration of use of antifungal agents [corrected] in the multivariable model, use of colistin was identified as the only independent risk  factor (adjusted odds ratio = 7.78, p = .002). conclusions: colistin-resistant k. pneumoniae, a. baumannii, and p. aeruginosa pathogens may be encountered in clinical practice, in association with inappropriate colistin use. to prevent this phenomenon, colistin should be used judiciously, given that treatment options for colistin-resistant gram-negative bacteria are limited.

AB  == mortality from battlefield wounds has historically declined, thanks to better surgical management, faster transport of casualties, and improved antibiotics. today, one of the major challenges facing u.s. military caregivers is the presence of multidrug-resistant organisms in orthopaedic extremity wounds. the most frequently identified resistant strains of bacteria are staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex. overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics may be an  important factor in building resistant strains. acinetobacter infections appear to hospital-acquired and not from an initial colonization of the injury. more research is required to give military physicians the tools they require to reduce the infection rate and defeat multidrug-resistant organisms.

TI  == in vitro activity of isepamicin and other aminoglycosides against clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial bloodstream infections.
AB  == background and purpose: isepamicin is a newly introduced aminoglycoside in taiwan. since in vitro data for isepamicin against nosocomial gram-negative bloodstream infection from taiwan are limited, we compared the activity of isepamicin, amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin against nosocomial gram-negative  blood isolates. methods: a total of 247 non-duplicate nosocomial blood isolates of gram-negative bacteria collected between january 2003 and december 2003 in a major teaching hospital in taiwan were tested for their in vitro susceptibilities to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and isepamicin using the agar dilution method. the isolates included escherichia coli (31 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (31), enterobacter cloacae (30), serratia marcescens (31), morganella  morganii (21), citrobacter freundii (10), pseudomonas aeruginosa (31), acinetobacter baumannii (31), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31). results: overall, isepamicin had high antibacterial activity against the tested gram-negative bacteria. for the 154 enterobacteriaceae isolates, isepamicin had the lowest minimum concentration inhibiting 90% of isolates (mic90) among the tested drugs, while its resistance rate (3.9%) was equal to that of amikacin (3.9%) and lower than those of tobramycin (18.2%) and gentamicin (21.4%). for the 93 of non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli isolates, isepamicin had the lowest  mic90, and a resistance rate (23.7%) lower than those of amikacin (27.9%), tobramycin (38.7%) and gentamicin (40.9%). conclusions: the in vitro activity of  isepamicin against gram-negative bacteria isolates was equal or similar to amikacin and superior to other tested aminoglycosides. in view of its potential for less nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity than other aminoglycosides, isepamicin is a drug of choice for the empirical treatment of nosocomial infections caused by gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == aerosolized colistin as adjunctive treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria: a prospective study.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) remains the leading cause of death in patients with intensive care unit (icu) acquired infections associated with an attributable mortality around 30%. increasing antimicrobial resistance in patients with vap challenges intensivists to search for alternative therapeutic options. there is scarcity of data in the literature concerning the administration of aerosolized colistin in critically ill patients with vap due to multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-negative pathogens. methods: to assess the safety  and effectiveness of aerosolized colistin as an adjunctive to the intravenous antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of vap due to mdr gram-negative pathogens, we prospectively examined all patients, who received inhaled colistin. results: sixty critically ill patients with a mean apache ii score 16.7, received aerosolized colistin for the treatment of vap due to mdr pathogens [acinetobacter baumannii (37/60 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12/60 cases) and klebsiella pneumoniae strains (11/60 cases)]. half of the isolated pathogens were susceptible only to colistin. mean (+/-sd) daily dosage of aerosolized colistin was 2.2 (+/-0.7) million international units (iu). all patients received 2946 inhalations of colistin and the mean duration of administration was 16.4 days. fifty-seven patients received concomitant intravenous treatment with colistin or  other antimicrobial agents. bacteriological and clinical response of vap was observed in 50/60 (83.3%) patients. no adverse effects related to inhaled colistin were recorded. all cause hospital mortality was 25% while mortality attributable to vap was 16.7%. conclusions: aerosolized colistin may be considered as adjunctive to intravenous treatment in patients with vap due to mdr gram-negative bacteria susceptible to colistin in critically ill patients. although colistin is safe and effective, the best route of administration remains unclear. in addition, controlled comparative studies are needed to establish its  effectiveness and safety.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary community acquired meningitis is not a rare entity in last two decades.
AB  == the aim of this short note is to assess gram-negative bacillary community acquired meningitis (cbm) and nosocomial meningitis (nm) within 17 years nationwide survey. all cases of gram-negative bacillary cbm within 1990-2007 were assessed in national database of 372 patients with bacterial meningitis: 69 of gram-negative cases were nosocomial and 24 of gram-negative meningitis cases were cbm. those 24 cases were compared with all cbm (201 cases) for risk factors and outcome. among nosocomial gram-negative pathogens, a. baumannii in 23 cases, ps.  aeruginosa in 15 cases and enterobacteriaceae in 31 cases were isolated. among cbm, in 13 cases enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli 6, klebsiella pneumoniae 3, proteus mirabilis 2, enterobacter cloacae 2), in 5 cases ps. aeruginosa and in 6  cases acinetobacter baumannii were isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (csf). the only significant risk factor for cbm due to gram-negative bacilli was neonatal age (12.5% vs. 3.5%, p=0.04) as underlying disease. however, mortality among gram-negative bacillary meningitis was significantly higher (12.4% vs. 37.5%, p=0.001) in comparison to other meningitis.

TI  == [electron microscopic analysis of biofilm on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates and the relationship between bilofilm and lower respiratory infection].
AB  == objective: mechanical ventilation support is a very important method for the salvage of serious patients. however, it can result in the formation of an adherent matrix of bacteria on the surfaces of implanted materials which is termed "biofilm". biofilm is dense bacterial communities attached to a solid surface and surrounded by an exopolysaccharide matrix. one of the most important  features of bacterial biofilm is their resistance to antimicrobial agents and host immune system components. as a consequence, diseases involving biofilm are generally chronic and difficult to treat. the present study was conducted to explore the relationship between ett-biofilm and the lower respiratory infection  by observing microbial colonization and associated biofilm accumulation on the surface of endotracheal tubes (etts) removed from neonates treated with intubated mechanical ventilation. methods: twenty neonates undergoing mechanical ventilation (from january to june in 2005) were recruited into this study. clinical data about lower respiratory infection for each case were collected. etts were collected at the first time of extubation. a sterile control tube was also processed. for each ett, a 1-cm-long cross-sectional segment was divided into two portions for both scanning electron microscopy (sem) and aerobic/anaerobic cultures. the presence of biofilm on the surface of etts were examined by sem, meanwhile, bacteria harvested from the surface of etts and the secretions of lower respiratory tract were isolated, identified and assessed on antimicrobial susceptibility, respectively. results: the diagnosis on admission of the twenty cases included: neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (10), meconium aspirate syndrome (2), severe asphyxia (2), pneumatothorax (2), severe pneumonia (1), scleredema neonatorum (1), inborn pulmonary hypoplasia (1) and recurrent apnea (1). thirteen cases did not present symptoms and signs of lower respiratory infection before mechanical ventilation. however, during the mechanical ventilation process, symptoms and signs of lower respiratory infection presented and lasted until extubation. nine of the above mentioned thirteen cases (70%) had the same duration of tube use as mechanical ventilation duration (mean: 3.6 days). observation by sem showed that colonization was time dependent and the incidence of microbial colonization increased when the duration of tube use exceeded one days (12/20). there were no obvious bacterial colonies except that some amorphous material was noted in 5 of 20 etts as early as one day of tube use. up to 2 days of tube use (4/20), attached bacterial colonization was seen embedded in amorphous material (3/4). up to 3 days (7/20), a layer of biofilm formation presented on etts (5/7). furthermore, biofilm architecture became more  mature and complex if the duration exceeded 3 days. neither bacteria nor biofilm  formation was seen on the control ett. the results of aerobic/anaerobic cultures  showed that there were 14 cultures from etts (normal flora grew in 4) and 7 pathogens were isolated; 13 cultures from the secretions of lower respiratory tract (normal flora grew in 1) and 10 pathogens were isolated. seven samples had  the same pathogen both on the surface of etts and in the secretions of lower respiratory tract, which accounted for 50% of the positive cultures from etts, including xanthomonas maltophilia (2), klebsiella pneumoniae (2), acinetobacter lwoffii (1), acinetobacter baumannii (1) and normal flora (1). the gram-negative  bacteria isolated from the surface of etts and the secretions of lower respiratory tract presented multi-resistance to antibiotics. conclusions: the ett-biofilm develops into mature and complex form with the duration of tube use increase. this study provides evidence that there is correlation between microbial colonization, biofilm formation on the surface of etts and the lower respiratory infection in neonates who were intubated and ventilated for a prolonged period. ett-biofilm could also be a possible source of the recurrent infection. increased attention must be paid to modification of the ett to prevent or substantially reduce biofilm formation.

TI  == inhibitory effect of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  == objectives: to determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several gram-negative  and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. methods: the in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against h. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. time-kill assay was performed with two staphylococcus spp. strains. results: anti-h. pylori activity was detected with saccharomyces cerevisiae, bacillus spp., 1 enterococcus faecium and 2 lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 h. pylori strains tested. all staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-h. pylori effect: one staphylococcus auricularis and two staphylococcus epidermidis against all h. pylori tested; staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hominis and s. auricularis against six, five and seven h. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative staphylococcus against one h. pylori strain. an inhibitory effect was detected with one escherichia coli against one h. pylori. klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four h. pylori strains, and enterobacter cloacae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14  h. pylori isolates. no anti-h. pylori activity was detected with one lactobacillus spp., two lactococcus lactis, four streptococcus spp., one bacillus cereus, one e. faecium, one enterococcus faecalis, one e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two staphylococcus spp. strains tested. conclusions: several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit h. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.

TI  == polymyxin b for the treatment of multidrug-resistant pathogens: a critical review.
AB  == polymyxins have re-emerged in clinical practice owing to the dry antibiotic development pipeline and worldwide increasing prevalence of nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacteria. polymyxin b and colistin (polymyxin e) have been ultimately considered as the last-resort treatment of such infections. microbiological, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and clinical data available for polymyxin b are reviewed in this paper. polymyxin b has rapid in vitro bactericidal activity against major mdr gram-negative bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella  pneumoniae. acquired resistance to this agent is still rare among these pathogens. however, optimized dosage regimens are not known yet. good clinical outcomes have been observed in the majority of the patients treated with intravenous polymyxin b in recent studies. however, these studies failed to provide definitive conclusions due to limitations of study design and additional  clinical trials are required. although combination therapy may be an attractive option based on some currently available in vitro data, clinical data supporting  such recommendations are lacking. since polymyxins will be increasingly used for  the treatment of infections caused by mdr bacteria, clinical pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and toxicodynamic studies underpinning the optimal use of these drugs are urgently required.

TI  == emerging issues in the management of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == accumulating evidence indicates that treating seriously ill infected patients with active antibiotics early in the course of infection is critical to improving outcomes. the most common reason for ineffective empiric therapy is resistance to the agents used. gram-negative bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to many commonly used antibiotics, and some cases require older, more toxic antibiotics for adequate microbial coverage. the diversity of resistance mechanisms that underly multidrug resistance makes developing effective new antimicrobial agents very difficult, especially against problematic species such  as acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae. this growing problem requires a multipronged strategy that includes adherence to  infection control principles, parsimonious and rational use of current antimicrobial agents, and development of new agents active against multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == old antibiotics for infections in critically ill patients.
AB  == purpose of review: the alarming epidemic of multidrug-resistant bacteria and the  reluctance of the pharmaceutical industry to invest in the development of new antibiotics have forced clinicians to reintroduce forgotten antibiotics into their practice. this review highlights the effectiveness and safety of older antibiotics when used in the treatment of infections of critically ill patients.  recent findings: polymyxins emerged as useful antibiotics for the treatment of infections due to multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, in particular acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae. the nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity associated with their use are less frequent and  serious than previously reported. in addition, aerosolized polymyxins may be a useful weapon in the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia. fosfomycin and chloramphenicol have a wide antimicrobial spectrum, are used extensively in europe and africa, respectively, and may have an expanded role in our antimicrobial arsenal. fusidic acid remains active against various staphylococcal strains, while isepamicin (an aminoglycoside used in some european countries) is  slightly more effective than amikacin against some gram-negative bacteria. summary: the declining investment of the pharmaceutical industry in the development of new antibiotics and the increasing antimicrobial resistance create a fertile ground for the study and, probably, revival of older antibiotics for use, especially in critically ill patients.

TI  == investigation of sources of potential bias in laboratory surveillance for anti-microbial resistance.
AB  == purpose: there are a number of biases that may influence the validity of laboratory-based surveillance for antimicrobial resistance. our objective was to  evaluate the potential magnitude of bias in reporting of etiologic agents and their resistance rates associated with inclusion of multiple patient samples and  non-random timing and location of sampling. methods: all urine cultures submitted to a regional laboratory in the calgary health region during 2004 and 2005 were studied. comparisons were then made using either the overall cohort or different  subgroups compared with the "reference" or gold standard population where only the first isolate per patient per year per species was included. results: overall 56,897 organisms were cultured at > or =104 cfu/ml from 53,548 samples from 35,890 patients; 39,835 organisms were included in the reference cohort. escherichia coli was reported in 37,246 (65.5%) of overall cohort and 28,257 (70.9%) of the reference cohort. therefore, the overall cohort resulted in a relative underestimation of the importance of e. coli as the principal cause of urinary tract infections by 8%. similarly, reported rates of resistance to antimicrobial agents most notably ciprofloxacin [6,480/52,544 (12.3%) vs. 2,647/37,086 (7.1%)], gentamicin [2,991/48,070 (6.2%) vs. 1,567/34,608 (4.5%)], and ceftriaxone [1,737/44,922 (3.9%) vs. 889/32,745 (2.7%)] were higher in the overall than in the reference cohorts. there were large differences in both the distribution of organisms and rates of resistance associated with sampling during different times of the day, week, and year as well as from acute care hospitals and outpatient clinics (p< or =0.001). conclusions: reports from laboratory-based surveillance studies may be biased depending on the population studied and method of sampling employed. care must be taken in interpreting results of surveillance  studies that do not protect from these major sources of bias.

TI  == [selective action of broad-spectrum antibiotics on intestinal flora in sepsis in  rats].
AB  == objective: to investigate the selective effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics on the intestinal flora in sepsis in rats. methods: fifty-six sd rats were randomly  divided into normal control group, scald group [before ceftriaxone sodium (rocephin) treatment group], scald group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, scald group with 9 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group (before rocephin treatment group), sepsis group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group with 9 days of rocephin treatment. all the animals were incurred with 30% iii degree burns on their back followed by endotoxin challenge with a dose of 20  mg/kg 24 hours after the burn injury. the animals were treated with intraperitoneal injection of ceftriaxone 24 hours (60 mg/kg, quaque 12 hours) after the second hit with endotoxin. at the end of the treatment, the bacteria in stomach, intestine and colon were cultured. the number and kind of the bacteria were also determined. results: antibiotics significantly increased the number of  cocci (p<0.05 or p<0.01). the ratio between cocci and bacilli was markedly inverted. in selective culture of gut bacilli, e.coli was almost the only bacteria in the contents of stomach, intestine and colon in normal control group, but after burns and endotoxin challenge, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis appeared. after the rats received antibiotics treatment, e. coli decreased in number or disappeared, and was replaced mainly by pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus  and other bacilli. conclusion: broad-spectrum antibiotics can induce imbalance of bacteria flora in the gut, resulting in a reversion of the ratio between cocci and bacilli, and also reduction in intestinal colonization resistance. then, opportunistic pathogens become dominant flora in gut, which may cause antibiotic-related gut-origin diseases.

AB  == carbapenemases are beta-lactamases with versatile hydrolytic capacities. they have the ability to hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems. bacteria producing these beta-lactamases may cause serious infections in which the carbapenemase activity renders many beta-lactams ineffective. carbapenemases are members of the molecular class a, b, and d beta-lactamases. class a and d enzymes have a serine-based hydrolytic mechanism,  while class b enzymes are metallo-beta-lactamases that contain zinc in the active site. the class a carbapenemase group includes members of the sme, imi, nmc, ges, and kpc families. of these, the kpc carbapenemases are the most prevalent, found  mostly on plasmids in klebsiella pneumoniae. the class d carbapenemases consist of oxa-type beta-lactamases frequently detected in acinetobacter baumannii. the metallo-beta-lactamases belong to the imp, vim, spm, gim, and sim families and have been detected primarily in pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, there are increasing numbers of reports worldwide of this group of beta-lactamases in the enterobacteriaceae. this review updates the characteristics, epidemiology, and detection of the carbapenemases found in pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == impact of an antibiotic restriction policy on the antibiotic resistance patterns  of gram-negative microorganisms in an intensive care unit in greece.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of an antibiotic policy programme based on restriction of the empirical use of fluoroquinolones and ceftazidime on the susceptibilities of gram-negative microorganisms in a general intensive care unit (icu). the epidemiology of infections caused by the predominant icu pathogens, i.e. acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, and their resistance patterns as well as antibiotic consumption were recorded for a 6-month period. an antibiotic restriction policy  including ceftazidime and quinolones was applied. after an 18-month period of protocol application, the same parameters were recorded for another 6-month period. consumption of restricted and overall antibiotics was reduced by 92.5% and 55.4%, respectively. susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin of the three predominant infection-causing gram-negative bacilli were significantly increased. ceftazidime showed an increase in susceptibility only for p. aeruginosa. similar  rates of infectious episodes were recorded in the two periods and no differences  were observed either in overall mortality or in icu ecology as expressed by the type of microorganisms implicated in colonisation and/or infection. the reported  data suggest that an antibiotic restriction policy can significantly reduce antimicrobial consumption and antimicrobial resistance rates, although the latter effect can be also influenced by the prevalent resistance mechanisms and the prevalence of imported resistance.

TI  == control of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae in a children's hospital by changing antimicrobial agent usage policy.
AB  == objectives: this ambidirectional intervention study was performed to examine the  impact of a change in antibiotic policy on extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) prevalence in a children's hospital with a high prevalence of esbl production among escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. methods: the use of  extended-spectrum cephalosporins was restricted and use of beta-lactam/ beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was encouraged from 2002. all strains of e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolated from sterile body fluids from 1999 to 2005 were analysed for beta-lactamase production and the prevalences of esbl production were compared at three periods; pre-intervention (1999-2001), transitional period (2002-03) and post-intervention (2004-05). results: comparing the pre- and post-intervention periods, overall piperacillin/tazobactam use increased from 2.2 to 108.0 days on antibiotics/1000 patient admission days/year (ad) (p for trend < 0.001), whereas extended-spectrum cephalosporin use decreased from 175.0 to 96.9  ad (p for trend < 0.001). among 252 strains of e. coli (n = 128) and k. pneumoniae (n = 124), the overall prevalence of esbl producers decreased from 39.8% (41/103) to 22.8% (18/79) (p for trend = 0.018). this decreasing trend of esbl production was more evident for k. pneumoniae (64.1% to 25.6%; p for trend < 0.001) than e. coli (25.0% to 19.4%; p for trend = 0.514). the mortality rates of invasive disease caused by e. coli or k. pneumoniae remained unchanged. conclusions: the substitution of piperacillin/tazobactam for extended-spectrum cephalosporins successfully decreased the prevalence of esbl production of k. pneumoniae and e. coli in an institute for children where esbls were endemic. the impact of change in antibiotic policy was more evident in k. pneumoniae than e. coli.

TI  == convenient test using a combination of chelating agents for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases in the clinical laboratory.
AB  == although transmissible metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) are a serious threat to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy, the clsi currently does not recommend testing methods for the detection of mbls. the aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of double-disk tests (ddts) by using disks containing a combination of the chelators 2-mercaptopropionic acid (mpa) and tris-edta (te) to detect mbls. sixteen isolates (4 acinetobacter baumannii isolates, 6 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 serratia marcescens isolate, 1 aeromonas hydrophila isolate, 1 aeromonas veronii isolate, 2 chryseobacterium meningosepticum isolates, and 1 stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolate) producing imp-1, imp-1-like, imp-18, gim-1, spm-1, vim-2, vim-2-like, and chromosomal mbls and 20 isolates (7 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 3 escherichia coli isolates, 5 enterobacter cloacae isolates, 2 s. marcescens isolates, 1 proteus mirabilis isolate, and 2 a. baumannii isolates) producing non-mbl carbapenemases, ampc beta-lactamases, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were tested. the ddt method was evaluated by using four types of chelator disks (te, high-strength te, mpa, and te plus 20 microl of mpa [at various concentrations]) and the beta-lactams imipenem (ipm), meropenem (mem), ertapenem (ert), and ceftazidime (caz). ddts with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 1:320 mpa detected all mbls and yielded no false-positive  results. some, but not all, mbl producers were detected in ipm-based tests involving the single chelator te or mpa alone or by ert- or caz-based tests. ipm-based tests with mpa concentrations other than 1:320 and all mem-based tests  had suboptimal sensitivities or specificities. ddt with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 20 microl of 1:320 mpa appears to be convenient for the detection of mbls in the clinical laboratory.

TI  == the antimicrobial effect of heparin on common respiratory pathogens.
AB  == aim: the mucolytic, anticoagulative, anti-inflammatory and neo-angiogenic properties of inhaled heparin may benefit patients with burns and cystic fibrosis. we assessed the antibacterial effects of unfractionated heparin. methods: stored clinical isolates of acinetobacter baumannii (n =4), candida albicans (n = 5), haemophilus influenzae (n =5), klebsiella pneumoniae (n =4), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n=3), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7) were subcultured on horse blood agar, incubated at 35 degrees c overnight, then inoculated into trypticase soy broth to a density of 1 mcfarland standard. dilutions of unfractionated heparin (containing 250- 7500 u) and 100 microl of the 1.0 mcfarland standard broth were  incubated at 35 degrees c overnight in microtitre plates and then subcultured on  horse blood agar using 1 microl standard loops. colonies (representing viable organisms) were counted. results: heparin produced dose-dependent growth inhibition of three of seven s. pneumoniae isolates (complete inhibition at 2500u dose per 200 microl) and one of five h. influenzae isolates (complete inhibition  at 7500 u dose per 200 microl), but no inhibition of other isolates. conclusions: unfractionated heparin is unlikely to have antibacterial effects because of its unpredictable inhibition of growth of common respiratory pathogens.

TI  == short-term effect of antibiotic control policy on the usage patterns and cost of  antimicrobials, mortality, nosocomial infection rates and antibacterial resistance.
AB  == objectives: in 2003 turkish government released a new budget application instruction for regulating the usage of parenteral antibiotics inside and outside of the hospitals. in this study it was aimed to evaluate the effect of this instruction on the overall usage of restricted antibiotics, their cost, overall mortality, bacterial resistance patterns and nosocomial infection rates in intensive care units (icus) of our setting for march-october 2002 and march-october 2003 periods. methods and results: overall daily defined dose/1000  patients/day of restricted drugs decreased, whereas unrestricted drugs increased  significantly after the instruction. the cost of all analysed drugs in 2003 period was 540,303usd (-19.6%) less than 2002 period. nosocomial infection rates  in icus decreased significantly (p<0.05). when all microbiologically confirmed nosocomial bacteremia cases during the study period were analysed, amoxycilline/clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, piperacilline/tazobactam resistance and esbl rate in klebsiella pneumoniae decreased significantly (p<0.05). amikacin resistance in escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii increased significantly (p<0.05). conclusion: antibiotic  control is one of the most important and significant ways to save money, and to prevent antibacterial resistance.

TI  == when to include polymyxins in the empirical antibiotic regimen in critically ill  patients with fever? a decision analysis approach.
AB  == we sought to approach a practical question: should polymyxins be used in the initial empirical antibiotic regimen in the intensive care unit (icu) patient with fever that is thought to be due to infection? by retrieving data from the literature and the whonet greece, we formulated a mathematical model to estimate  the probability (ptotal) that a gram-negative bacterium susceptible only to polymyxins is isolated from an icu patient. ptotal = p1 * p2 * p3 * p4, where ptotal = total probability; p1 = probability that fever is due to infection; p2 = probability that infection is due to gram-negative bacteria; p3 = probability that the gram-negative bacterium is acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or klebsiella pneumoniae; and p4 = probability that a. baumannii, p.  aeruginosa, or k. pneumoniae is susceptible only to polymyxins. using the information from our data sources, we estimated that p1 (before physician input in differential diagnosis) = 0.5, p2 = 0.523, p3 = 0.79, and p4 = 0.567, thus ptotal = p1 * p2 * p3 * p4 = 0.5 * 0.523 * 0.79 * 0.567 = 0.117 = 11.7%. based on this information and combining it with data regarding the attributable mortality  of inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment, 4 to 5 patients in every 100  icu patients will die if physicians do not include polymyxins in the initial empirical regimen in the icu setting for an episode of fever due to infection. polymyxins should probably be included in the empirical antibiotic regimen in the icu setting in hospitals, where the observed probability that a gram-negative bacterium (a. baumannii, p. aeruginosa, or k. pneumoniae) is polymyxin-only-susceptible is close to that (50%) used in our model (based on the individual hospital data).

TI  == evolution of antimicrobial resistance among pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae in brooklyn, ny.
AB  == objectives: to document resistance patterns of three important nosocomial pathogens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae, present in hospitals in brooklyn, ny. methods: susceptibility profiles of pathogens gathered during a surveillance study in 2006 were analysed  and compared with similar surveys performed in 1999 and 2001. mics were determined according to clsi standards, and selected isolates were screened by pcr for the presence of vim, imp and kpc beta-lactamases. results: for p. aeruginosa, susceptibility to most antimicrobials fell in 2001 and then reached a plateau. however, there was a progressive decrease in the number of patients with p. aeruginosa during the three surveys. while the total number of isolates of a.  baumannii remained steady, there was a progressive decrease in susceptibility to  most classes of antimicrobial agents, and approximately one-third had combined resistance to carbapenems, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. there was a noticeable rise in the number of isolates of k. pneumoniae over the surveillance  periods, suggesting that this has become the predominant pathogen in many medical centres. over one-third of k. pneumoniae collected in 2006 carried the carbapenemase kpc, and 22% were resistant to all three classes of antimicrobial agents. conclusions: hospitals in our region have been beset with antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacteria. k. pneumoniae has rapidly emerged as the most common multidrug-resistant pathogen. improved therapeutic agents and  methods of detection are needed to reduce transmission of these bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility profile of selected bacteraemic pathogens from private institutions in south africa.
AB  == objectives: the national antimicrobial surveillance forum is a continuous surveillance organisation comprising all academic/public and private sector laboratories in south africa. methods: the antibiotic susceptibility of blood culture isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and staphylococcus aureus from patients in private hospitals in five major centres were investigated. antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by 12 participating laboratories according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines. extended-spectrum b-lactamase (esbl) production was  determined in selected species of enterobacteriaceae irrespective of source. results: the overall prevalence of ampicillin resistance in blood culture isolates of e. coli (n = 471) was 84%, and 20% were resistant to the fluoroquinolones. considerable geographical differences were noted between the centres with regard to the k. pneumoniae (n = 636) resistance rates for ceftriaxone and/or cefotaxime (39 - 87%). the most active agents in the enterobacter spp. (n = 244) were imipenem/meropenem, ertapenem, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and cefepime, with 100%, 94%, 88%, 87% and 80% susceptibility, respectively. carbapenem resistance in p. aeruginosa (n = 382) varied between 42% and 45%, and in the case of a. baumannii (n = 190) resistance varied between 32%  and 33% for meropenem and imipenem respectively. the nationwide incidence of oxacillin resistance in s. aureus (n = 629) was 36%. overall, the prevalence of esbl production among all isolates of k. pneumoniae was 26% (n = 7 514), while in enterobacter spp. it was 12% (n = 4 031) and in e. coli 5% (n = 28 412). conclusions: the data highlight the widespread problem of antibiotic resistance among important bacteraemic pathogens in private institutions in south africa. continued surveillance is vital to guide appropriate empirical therapy for invasive infections.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

AB  == in the present study, samples of pond water, sediment and farmed species were collected at 12 fish and shrimp farms in malaysia, thailand and vietnam to determine the biodiversity and environmental distribution of chloramphenicol-resistant (cmr) mesophilic heterotrophs in southeast asian aquaculture sites. following isolation on iso-sensitest agar supplemented with 35mug ml(-1) cm and dereplication using (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting, 557 genotypically unique cmr strains were subjected to polyphasic identification. the 557 mesophilic heterotrophic cmr isolates represented 18 different genera largely dominated by the genera escherichia (40.2%), pseudomonas (11.7%), acinetobacter (11.1%), klebsiella (7.5%) and bacillus (5.9%). a total of 439 cmr isolates were  further assigned to 31 described species or species groups, mainly including organisms that have been associated with various human opportunistic infections such as escherichia coli (n=219), pseudomonas putida (n=47), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=38) and acinetobacter baumannii (n=23). strains of escherichia, and most notably, of e. coli, were the only common group of cmr heterotrophs irrespective of country, sample type or farm type. together with other predominant but less widespread groups such as acinetobacters and pseudomonads, the results of this biodiversity study suggest that e. coli can be regarded as a  potential indicator of cm resistance in southeast asian aquaculture environments.

TI  == pandrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria: the dawn of the post-antibiotic era?
AB  == the evolving problem of antimicrobial resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae has led to the emergence of clinical isolates susceptible to only one class of antimicrobial agents and eventually to pandrug-resistant (pdr) isolates, i.e. resistant to all available antibiotics. we reviewed the available evidence from laboratory and clinical studies that reported on polymyxin-resistant and/or pdr p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii or k. pneumoniae clinical isolates. eleven laboratory studies reported  on isolates with resistance to polymyxins, three of which (including two surveillance studies) also included data regarding pdr isolates. in addition, two clinical studies (from central and southern europe) reported on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients infected with pdr isolates. these data suggest that polymyxin-resistant or pdr p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii and k. pneumoniae clinical isolates are currently relatively rare. however, they have important global public health implications because of the therapeutic problems they pose. the fears for the dawn of a post-antibiotic era appear to be justified, at least for these three gram-negative bacteria. we must increase our  efforts to preserve the activity of available antibiotics, or at least expand as  much as possible the period of their use, whilst intense research efforts should  be focused on the development and introduction into clinical practice of new antimicrobial agents.

TI  == sputum bacteriology in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in taiwan with an emphasis on klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == background and objective: bacterial infection is one of the major causes of acute exacerbation of copd (aecopd). this study was undertaken to investigate the microbiology of aecopd. methods: medical records from 494 episodes of aecopd in patients admitted to the national taiwan university hospital from january 2000 to june 2004 were reviewed. severity of copd was classified according to the 2003 global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease guideline. results: potential pathogenic microorganisms were isolated from patients in 328 (66.4%) episodes of aecopd. the predominant bacteria were klebsiella pneumoniae (19.6%),  pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.8%) and haemophilus influenzae (7.5%), followed by acinetobacter baumannii (6.9%), enterobacter species (6.1%) and staphylococcus aureus (6.1%). the incidence of streptococcus pneumoniae was 2.4%. spirometry results obtained within 1 year of the exacerbation were available in 186 cases. k. pneumoniae was more frequently isolated in stage i copd (39.1%) than stage ii  (16.6%), iii (13.8%) and iv (9.4%). no glucose non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli were isolated in stage i patients. multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that p. aeruginosa (odds ratio (or) 3.19; 95% confidence interval (ci): 1.21-8.38), intubation (or 14.81; 95% ci: 5.08-43.12) and age (or  1.1; 95% ci: 1.03-1.17) were independent risk factors for mortality. conclusions: klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa are the most common sputum pathogens in hospitalized patients with aecopd in taiwan, with the former being more commonly  isolated from mild copd and the latter associated with poor clinical outcome. these results should be considered when deciding which antibiotics should initially be used to treat patients with aecopd.

AB  == tigecycline is a new glycyclcycline antimicrobial recently approved for use in the usa, europe and elsewhere. while related to the tetracyclines, tigecycline overcomes many of the mechanisms responsible for resistance to this class. it demonstrates favourable in vitro potency against a variety of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including those frequently demonstrating resistance to multiple classes of antimicrobials. this includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae,  vancomycin-resistant enterococci, acinetobacter baumannii, beta-lactamase producing strains of haemophilis influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. in contrast, minimum inhibitory concentrations for pseudomonas and proteus spp. are markedly elevated. tigecycline is administered parenterally twice daily. randomised, controlled trials have demonstrated that tigecycline is non-inferior to the comparators for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections, as well as complicated intra-abdominal infections. the most frequent and problematic side effect associated with its administration to date has been nausea and/or vomiting.

TI  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection antimicrobial susceptibility program in spain: a 5-year analysis.
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection program is a global study providing in vitro surveillance data on antimicrobial susceptibility in centers prescribing meropenem. this study summarizes data on the activity of meropenem and 5 comparators against 4022 clinical isolates from 7 centers in spain (1999-2003). those bacteria intrinsically resistant to meropenem were excluded. among enterobacteriaceae, 100% of enterobacter spp., citrobacter spp.,  and serratia spp. were susceptible to meropenem. escherichia coli and klebsiella  pneumoniae susceptibilities to carbapenems were 100% and > or =98%, respectively. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae were 3.8% of isolates, and all of them were susceptible to meropenem. ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli was around 20%. meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were the most active agents against pseudomonas aeruginosa. acinetobacter baumannii were 61-90% susceptible to carbapenems, but only 6-21% susceptible to ciprofloxacin. in this  period, around 100% of oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci were susceptible to meropenem. there was no significant decrease in susceptibility to the carbapenems throughout the 5-year period. the clinical use of meropenem in 7 spanish centers  did not increase bacterial resistance to this agent in the microorganisms evaluated.

TI  == frequency and predictors of colonization of the respiratory tract by vim-2-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients of a newly established intensive care unit.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the frequency and predictors of colonization of the respiratory tract by metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing gram-negative  bacteria in patients admitted to a newly established intensive care unit (icu) of a tertiary care hospital. specimens of tracheobronchial aspirates for microbiological studies were obtained every day for the first 3 days of the icu stay and subsequently every third day for the rest of the icu stay. pcr analysis  and nucleotide sequencing were performed to identify bacteria that had mbl genes. thirty-five patients (20 male, 15 female) were hospitalized during the initial 3  month period of functioning of the icu. colonization of the lower respiratory tract by gram-negative bacteria was found in 29 of 35 patients (83 %) during the  first 6-20 days (median 13 days) following admission to the icu (13 patients with acinetobacter baumannii, ten with pseudomonas aeruginosa, three with enterobacter aerogenes, two with klebsiella pneumoniae and one with stenotrophomonas maltophilia). six of 29 patients (21 %) colonized with gram-negative bacteria had bla(vim-2)-positive p. aeruginosa isolates; one of these patients developed clinical infection due to this micro-organism. previous use of carbapenems (p=0.01) or other beta-lactams (p=0.03), as well as a stay in the icu of >20 days (p<0.001), were associated with colonization with bla(vim-2)-producing p. aeruginosa. in conclusion, colonization by gram-negative bacteria of the respiratory tract of patients in this newly established icu was common (83 %). use of beta-lactams, including carbapenems, was associated with subsequent colonization of the respiratory tract with mbl-positive p. aeruginosa.

TI  == influence of culture site-specific mic distributions on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of piperacillin/tazobactam and piperacillin: a data analysis.
AB  == background: investigators who perform pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) modeling with monte carlo simulation have historically not stratified microbiological data by culture site. this lack of stratification might be problematic if susceptibility patterns differ among sites and might lead to differences in pk-pd. objective: this study compared the pk-pd of 2 antimicrobial regimens against 5 gram-negative bacterial species form 3 culture sites. methods: this data analysis was performed at the department of pharmacology, the university of texas health science center, san antonio, texas. blood, pulmonary (ie, bronchial, endotracheal, lung, respiratory, sputum, and tracheal secretions), and wound distributions of mics were extracted from the 2002 intensive care unit surveillance system database. bacteria included acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the pk properties of piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g every 4 hours) and piperacillin (3 g every 4 hours) were obtained from studies in healthy volunteers. monte carlo simulation was used in 10,000 patients for each antimicrobial-bacteria-culture site combination. the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) for a free percentage time above the mic of > or =50% was determined for each combination, and a clinically significant difference was defined a priori as > or =10%. results: data from 2408 pulmonary, 490 blood, and  242 wound isolates were included. for piperacillin/tazobactam, the cfr varied <10% by culture site in all 5 bacterial species. site-specific differences were noted in mic50 for piperacillin versus e cloacae and e coli and mic90 for piperacillin/tazobactam versus k pneumoniae and p aeruginosa. likewise, for piperacillin, the cfr was similar among the 3 culture sites for p aeruginosa. however, the cfr for piperacillin varied by > or =10% for a baumannii (blood > wound), e cloacae (pulmonary > blood), e coli (pulmonary and blood > wound), and  k pneumoniae (wound > blood). conclusions: the pk-pd models based on pk properties found in healthy humans and site-specific mic distributions in this study suggest that for piperacillin, culture-site differences subsequently resulted in cfr differences that exceeded a predetermined level of clinical significance. furthermore, these data suggest that traditional reporting strategies for microbiological data (ie, mic50 and mic90) might fail to adequately characterize the mic population.

TI  == impact of ceftazidime restriction on gram-negative bacterial resistance in an intensive care unit.
AB  == the present study included three periods: (1) a 12-month pre-restriction and control period in 2001; (2) a 12-month restriction period with reduced ceftazidime prescribing in favor of piperacillin-tazobactam (2002); (3) and a 24  month post-restriction period (2003-2004). note that, for results, p represents the difference between 2002 and 2001; p', the difference between 2003 and 2001; and p'', the difference between 2004 and 2001. no changes in hygiene practices were observed during these three periods. the purpose of this study was to assess the effect of reducing ceftazidime use in an intensive care unit (icu) upon gram-negative bacterial resistance, particularly as regards pseudomonas aeruginosa. during the three periods of the study, patients were similar concerning age, simplified acute physiology score (sapsii), the site of nosocomial infection, and the requirements for mechanical ventilation (75% in 2001, 76% in 2002, 74% in 2003, and 85% in 2004). the most commonly isolated pathogens were p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterobacteriaceae. the use of ceftazidime decreased significantly from 12.6% in 2001 to 9% in 2002,  to 3% in 2003 (p' = 0.0009), and 2.6% in 2004 (p'' = 0.0001) in favor of piperacillin-tazobactam (0% 2001 to 3.7% in 2003; p' = 0.002; and 5% in 2004; p'' = 0.0001). simultaneously, we observed a significant decrease in isolates of p. aeruginosa resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam (p = 0.03; p' = 0.004; p'' = 0.009), and those resistant to imipenem in 2003 (p' = 0.008). we also noted a significant decrease in a. baumannii isolates resistant to ceftazidime (p' = 0.01; p'' = 0.0004) and those resistant to imipenem in both 2002 and 2004 (p = 0.03; p'' = 0.04), and a considerable decrease in isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae producing expanded spectrum betalactamase (esbl) in 2003 and 2004 (p'  = 0.04; p'' = 6.10(-5)). in contrast, we noted an increase in penicillinase-producing isolates of k. pneumoniae, from 6% in 2001 to 16% in 2002 (p = 0.01), 20% in 2003 (p' = 0.001), and 32% in 2004 (p'' = 10(-6)). we concluded that restriction of ceftazidime use was demonstrated to be efficient in reducing antimicrobial resistance, especially to k. pneumoniae esbl.

TI  == pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic rationale for cefepime dosing regimens in intensive care units.
AB  == objectives: (i) to develop a population pharmacokinetics (pk) model for cefepime  in patients in intensive care units (icus). (ii) to assess the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile of various cefepime dosing regimens and to assess their expected probability of target attainment (=pta expectation value) against common icu pathogens such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. methods: thirteen icu patients received cefepime 2 g 12 hourly intravenous (3 min). twelve blood samples were taken on two occasions: (i) immediately after initial dose; and (ii) between days 3 and 6 after starting therapy. population pk models were developed  using nonmem. based on the final covariate model, monte carlo simulations were undertaken (n=1000) to simulate free-drug concentrations of cefepime for two administration methods: (i) intermittent bolus administration (iba); and (ii) continuous infusion (ci). concentration-time profiles were evaluated by the probability of achieving free-drug concentration above the mic for >65% of the dosing interval. finally, using local mic distributions of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii the pta expectation values for each dosing administration method were evaluated. results: a three-compartment model with zero-order input best described the concentration-time data. the pta expectation values for e. coli and k. pneumoniae were >90% in all ci doses but only when administered as 1 g every 6 h and higher daily doses for iba. for the current treatment protocol, 2 g every 12 h, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii achieved target concentrations of only 54% and 28%, respectively. for p. aeruginosa, a ci of at least 4 g/day was required to achieve a pta expectation value>90% while for a. baumannii a 6 g/day ci only achieved a pta expectation value of 75%. conclusions: when given as iba or ci for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, cefepime should be successful in achieving the bactericidal target. for p. aeruginosa higher doses of cefepime (>4 g/day) are required to achieve the required pta expectation value. cefepime fails to achieve the bactericidal target even when administered at high doses, e.g. 6 g/day, for a. baumannii.

TI  == colistin: the re-emerging antibiotic for multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  == increasing multidrug resistance in gram-negative bacteria, in particular pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae, presents a critical problem. limited therapeutic options have forced infectious disease clinicians and microbiologists to reappraise the clinical application of  colistin, a polymyxin antibiotic discovered more than 50 years ago. we summarise  recent progress in understanding the complex chemistry, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of colistin, the interplay between these three aspects, and their effect on the clinical use of this important antibiotic. recent clinical findings are reviewed, focusing on evaluation of efficacy, emerging resistance, potential toxicities, and combination therapy. in the battle against rapidly emerging bacterial resistance we can no longer rely entirely on the discovery of  new antibiotics; we must also pursue rational approaches to the use of older antibiotics such as colistin.

AB  == risk factors and outcomes for patients with nosocomial acinetobacter baumannii bacteraemia were compared with those for patients with nosocomial klebsiella pneumoniae bacteraemia in a single centre in israel between 2000 and 2003. data were collected retrospectively through patient chart review. in total, 112 patients with a. baumannii bacteraemia and 90 patients with k. pneumoniae bacteraemia were identified. a. baumannii was significantly associated with poorer performance status, mechanical ventilation, presence of devices, prior treatment with carbapenems, pneumonia as the source of infection and inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment. all-cause 30-day mortality was higher for a. baumannii bacteraemia compared with k. pneumoniae bacteraemia (61.6% vs 38.9%, p=0.001). variables significantly associated with mortality at the univariate level (p<0.1) were entered into a multi-variable logistic regression model for mortality. a. baumannii remained significantly associated with mortality when adjusted for all other risk factors (odds ratio 3.61, 95% confidence interval 1.55-8.39). this result did not change when the analysis was  repeated for subgroups of less severely ill patients, i.e. those who were not ventilated and those who did not present with septic shock. these results support the view that nosocomial bacteraemia due to a. baumannii is associated with increased mortality.

TI  == culture-proven bacterial meningitis in elderly patients in southern taiwan: clinical characteristics and prognostic factors.
AB  == the epidemiologic landscape of causative pathogens and clinical characteristics of bacterial meningitis varies with several clinical factors including preceding/pre-existent medical and/or surgical conditions, modes of contraction,  geographic distributions, status of vaccinations, the study time periods and differences among age groups. in order to delineate the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in senior adults (ages > or =60 y/o) in southern taiwan, we analyzed the clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes of 64 senior adults (42 men and 22 women, aged 60-80 years) with bacterial meningitis collected over a period of 13 years at our hospital. the prognostic factors between fatal and non-fatal groups of patients were compared. twenty-seven of the 64 patients belonged to a nosocomial infection group, and the other 37 comprised a community-acquired infection group. sixty percent (39/64) of the patients had a post-neurosurgical state as the most preceding event prior to infection. liver disease (13) and diabetes mellitus (6) were the most common underlying conditions of the other 25  patients with spontaneous meningitis. of these 64 patients, klebsiella (k.) pneumoniae (18), acinetobacter baumannii (5), escherichia coli (5), and enterobacter species (5) were the most commonly implicated gram-negative pathogens. staphylococcus (s.) aureus infection was increasing during the study period. the therapeutic results of this group of patients showed a mortality rate of 38% (24/64). the presence of septic shock was the most significant prognostic  factor. in conclusion, for this study group, a post-neurosurgical state was the single most important preceding event for senior adults developing bacterial meningitis. of the implicated pathogens, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus were the most common gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, respectively. the therapeutic result of this specific group of patients showed a high mortality rate; however, the small case number and possible bias of case selection have limited the analytical conclusions of this study.

TI  == tigecycline: first of a new class of antimicrobial agents.
AB  == tigecycline is the first commercially available member of the glycylcyclines, a new class of antimicrobial agents. the glycylcyclines are derivatives of the tetracycline antibiotics, with structural modifications that allow for potent gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic activity, including certain multidrug-resistant strains. the enhanced activity can be attributed to stronger  binding affinity and enhanced protection against several mechanisms of resistance that affect other antibiotic classes such as tetracyclines. tigecycline exhibits  generally bacteriostatic action by reversibly binding to the 30s ribosomal subunit and inhibiting protein translation. in vitro activity has been demonstrated against multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant and glycopeptide-intermediate and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, as well as vancomycin-resistant enterococci. multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens, such as acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli, are typically highly susceptible to tigecycline. the drug also has displayed significant activity against many clinically important anaerobic organisms. this  agent demonstrates a predictable pharmacokinetic profile and minimal drug interactions, and is generally well tolerated, with nausea being the most common  adverse event. it was approved in june 2005 for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (sssis) and complicated intraabdominal infections.  currently, a limited number of broad-spectrum antimicrobials are available to combat multidrug-resistant organisms. the addition of new agents is essential to  limiting the spread of these pathogens and improving outcomes in patients with these types of infections. tigecycline has demonstrated promising results in initial in vitro and clinical studies for sssis and complicated intraabdominal infections; however, further clinical experience will clarify its role as a broad-spectrum agent.

AB  == we investigated the in vitro activity of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against gram-negative bacterial isolates from intensive care units (icus) in taiwan. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 1030 bacterial isolates recovered from icus of nine major teaching hospitals was performed using the agar dilution method. sulbactam was added to piperacillin either at a fixed sulbactam  concentration of 4 mg/l and 8 mg/l or at a piperacillin:sulbactam ratio of 2:1 and 4:1. piperacillin/sulbactam at a ratio of 2:1 or a fixed 8 mg/l concentration of sulbactam had better activities against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens than other piperacillin/sulbactam formulations. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin/sulbactam (2:1 or 4:1 ratios) had mic(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) of 64 mg/l (>90% susceptibility) compared with 64 mg/l for cefoperazone/sulbactam (68% susceptibility) and 128 mg/l for piperacillin/tazobactam (82% susceptibility). for acinetobacter baumannii, both piperacillin/sulbactam (either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/l sulbactam) and cefoperazone/sulbactam were the most potent agents. adding sulbactam to piperacillin resulted in increased susceptibility rates among piperacillin-resistant p. aeruginosa (53-57% in either 2:1 or 4:1 ratios) and a.  baumannii (38-46% in either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/l concentration of sulbactam) isolates. results of susceptibility tests with piperacillin/sulbactam  are dependent on the method used. piperacillin/sulbactam combinations possessed better in vitro activities than piperacillin alone or piperacillin/tazobactam against p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii.

AB  == background and purpose: while nosocomial infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, the availability of timely and accurate epidemiological information on nosocomial pathogens is essential to the appropriate selection of  empirical therapy. this study analyzed nosocomial bloodstream infections (nbsis)  surveillance data to determine trends in the distribution of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these pathogens. methods: during the period from 1996 to 2003 at national cheng kung university hospital, patients with nbsis were enrolled in the study, and the ranking of pathogens and status of antimicrobial resistance were determined. results: from 1996 to 2003, there were  4,038 episodes of nbsis. the overall incidence was 1.79 episodes per 1,000 inpatient-days. aerobic gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci, fungi, and anaerobes were responsible for 51%, 37%, 10%, and 1.6% of nbsis, respectively. the 5 leading pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16% of nbsis), staphylococcus aureus (13%), candida spp. (10%), acinetobacter baumannii (8%), and escherichia coli (8%). oxacillin resistance was found in 90% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 75% of s. aureus isolates. in contrast to enterococcus faecalis, in which only 1% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 78% of enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to ampicillin. the emerging antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative pathogens included multidrug-resistant a. baumannii, cephalosporin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli. despite the annual increase in the use of fluconazole, candida albicans (54%) remained the most common causative pathogen of nosocomial candidemia. conclusions: in summary, gram-negative bacilli predominated among pathogens causing nbsis and an upsurge in the threat of antimicrobial resistance in our hospital occurred during the 8-year period. surveillance of the characteristics of nbsis and antimicrobial resistance patterns, together with appropriate antibiotic and infection control measures, should be reinforced.

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of invasive pathogens: the estonian experience.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the needs for surveillance of invasive gram-negative pathogens in estonia. the antimicrobial susceptibility data of invasive isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci were collected in accordance with earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) protocols. despite the higher rate of gram positive pathogens, their resistance to antimicrobials was low in contrast to the elevated resistance established for gram negative pathogens. the higher resistance to antimicrobials was particularly associated with a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa. also, the proportion of extended spectrum betalactamase (esbl)-producing strains was 23% among klebsiella spp. and 3.6% among e. coli. the inclusion of invasive gram negative pathogens in antimicrobial resistance surveillance provides useful information concerning local pathogen susceptibility, as well as for the empirical treatment of suspected infections.

TI  == incidence of antimicrobial-resistant ventilator associated pneumonia: an eighteen-month survey.
AB  == aim: microbes commonly involved in ventilator associated pneumonia (vap) are difficult to eradicate: pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii are often resistant to piperacillin, aztreonam and ceftazidim while klebsiella pneumoniae and other enterobacteriaceae are resistant to third generation cephalosporins. physicians need to tailor their therapeutic approach depending on individual patients and clinical setting, firmly based on local epidemiology. the aim of this study was to assess the incidence of vap caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria in our icu. methods: we conducted a retrospective review of all patients mechanically ventilated for longer than 72 h, who developed pneumonia over an eighteen-month period for whom final culture data were available. one-hundred and forty-three patients admitted to a university hospital medical surgical icu were included in this survey. vap was diagnosed by  centers for disease control and prevention criteria and confirmed by mini- bronchoalveolar lavage. results: in this study, the incidence of vap in the period january 1, 2002-june 31, 2003 was very high, accounting for about 20% of all at-risk cases. multiresistant agents were involved in about 57% of vap occurring within 7 days of mechanical ventilation, and in 80% of late vap. conclusions: this study revealed differences in vap incidence and features among  our icu and literature data, indicating a need for caution when using hospital infection surveillance data for comparisons and choice of therapy. in our setting, with high levels of antibiotic resistance, combined approaches of non-antibiotic using strategies and education programs might be beneficial.

TI  == making the most of surveillance studies: summary of the optama program.
AB  == antibiotic surveillance studies lack consideration of pharmacodynamics and provide little information about optimal dosing. by using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) data derived from a global surveillance study and monte carlo simulation, the optimizing pharmacodynamic target attainment using the mystic antibiogram (optama) program was established to impart greater understanding of the ability to attain pharmacodynamic exposure for specific dosing regimens and their relationship with percent susceptibility. early optama studies focused on determining the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) for various antibiotics against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa regionally in europe and the americas. later reports considered the prevalence of specific bacteria causing infections to estimate the cfr for empiric therapy of pneumonia, bloodstream, complicated skin/skin structure, and intra-abdominal infections. collectively, the approach of the optama program provides a novel tool that complements susceptibility data to help in the selection of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy at the national, regional, and institutional level.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of roselle calyx and protocatechuic acid.
AB  == the in vitro inhibitory effect of roselle calyx and protocatechuic acid, a compound derived from roselle calyx, on the growth of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii was studied. the data from inhibition zone and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values showed that both roselle calyx extract and  protocatechuic acid inhibited effectively the growth of all test bacterial pathogens, the antibacterial activity of protocatechuic acid being significantly  greater than roselle calyx (p < 0.05). furthermore, heat treatment did not affect the antibacterial activity of roselle calyx and protocatechuic acid against all test pathogens. the time-kill data from protocatechuic acid showed this agent provided concentration dependent antibacterial activities in broth and human plasma (p < 0.05); however, protocatechuic acid showed less inhibitory activity in human plasma than in broth (p < 0.05). these agents based on their lower mic values, heat tolerance and concentration dependent antibacterial activity may be  useful in clinical infection prevention or therapy.

TI  == diagnosis and treatment of bacterial pneumonia in liver transplantation recipients: report of 33 cases.
AB  == background: bacterial pneumonia in the recipients of liver transplantation (ltx)  is a common postoperative complication influencing the prognosis greatly. in this article, the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial pneumonia in 33 ltx recipients  are reported. methods: from february 1999 to january 2003, a total of 103 patients underwent allogeneic ltx at our center; afterwards, a retrospective analysis was made on their postoperative clinical manifestations, including symptoms (expectoration, panting and fever), sign (rale), results of laboratory examinations (white blood cell count and sputum culture of tracheal secretions or pleural fluid culture), and chest x-ray films. the following data of the pneumonia and non-pneumonia groups were collected, and the rank sum test (spss 11.0, wilcoxon's method) was used to analyze the duration of postoperative respirator utilization and the volume of pleural effusion through pleurocentesis  or pleural drainage. results: in the 103 patients, 33 experienced 53 episodes of  bacterial pneumonia during their hospital stay after transplantation, 14 of them  (42.42%) had more than three manifestations of the seven mentioned above. the pathogens causing bacterial pneumonia included pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.48%), klebsiella pneumoniae (15.53%), acinetobacter baumannii (10.68%), and staphylococcus aureus (7.77%). amilkacin, tienam, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, etc. were the antibiotics of choice against those bacteria. acute rejection occurred during the treatment of bacterial pneumonia in 16 patients, and 5 of them died. wilcoxon's rank sum test of the data indicated that the pneumonia group had longer duration of postoperative ventilator treatment and larger volume of pleural effusion than the non-pneumonia group (p < 0.05). conclusions: the clinical manifestations of pneumonia after ltx might be atypical, and special attention should be paid to the respiratory symptoms and signs within 2 months after ltx. whenever the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia is confirmed, consideration should be given to reasonable use of antibiotics and regulation of  immunity in addition to other routine therapies.

TI  == evaluation of techniques for detection of carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae in stool surveillance cultures.
AB  == screening for gastrointestinal colonization with multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens is an important component of infection control protocols. in the new york city region, carbapenem-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae strains, which harbor the kpc carbapenem-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase, have rapidly emerged. the potential utility of screening medium, which involved using 10-mug imipenem disks, was investigated. the method of placing a sample from a fecal surveillance culture into broth containing an imipenem disk appeared to have the greatest sensitivity for detecting kpc-producing k. pneumoniae. gastrointestinal colonization with two other carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii, was also detected using this  method. placing fecal surveillance specimens into broth containing an imipenem disk is an easy method for screening samples for carbapenem-resistant nosocomial  pathogens.

TI  == bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  == bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in western countries. reports indicate that appropriate administration  of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio vulnificus, and salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. the phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of helicobacter pylori and p. aeruginosa, respectively. in addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such  as streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and group b streptococci. all phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.

TI  == n-butanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (bhl) deficient pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from an intensive care unit.
AB  == acylated homoserine lactones (ahls) are self-generated diffusible signal molecules that mediate population density dependent gene expression (quorum sensing) in a variety of gram-negative bacteria, and several virulence genes of human pathogens are known to be controlled by ahls. in this study, strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli and klebsiella  pneumoniae, isolated from intensive care patients, were screened for ahl production by using ahl responsive indicator strains of chromobacterium violaceum cv026 and agrobacterium tumefaciens nt1. positive reactions were recorded for all 50 isolates of p. aeruginosa and 10 isolates of acinetobacter baumannii with agrobacterium tumefaciens nt1. surprisingly, most p. aeruginosa isolates gave negative results with c. violaceum cv026 in contrast to previous reports. this suggests that the new isolates of p. aeruginosa either failed to make short chain ahls or the level of the signal molecule is very low.

TI  == contamination of patients' files in intensive care units: an indication of strict handwashing after entering case notes.
AB  == background: the extent to which bedside patients' files become contaminated and the range of bacterial flora attributable to contamination in high-risk areas of  the hospital are not known with certainty. the aim of the present study was to determine the degree of contamination of the patient's files and also to analyze  and compare the spectrum of contaminant bacterial flora between the intensive care unit (icu) and surgical wards, the 2 most high-risk areas for nosocomial transmission of infection. methods: microbiologic samples were collected from the exposed outer surface of the patients' files kept bedside in the icu and surgical wards with sterile swabs moistened with sterile normal saline. swabs were cultured within an hour of collection on blood agar and macconkey's agar plates,  which were incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. gram-negative bacilli were identified by gram's stain, catalase, oxidase tests, and api 20e and api 20ne. staphylococcus species were identified by gram's stain, catalase test, and tube coagulase test. antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated bacteria was determined by the disk diffusion technique according to the criteria of national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). results: in icu, 85.2% (87/102) and, in surgical wards, 24.7% (22/89) of patient's files were found to be contaminated with pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria (or, 17.664; 95% ci: 8.050-39.423; p < .0001). pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated bacteria (32.3%, 33/102) in icus, whereas staphylococcus aureus was the peak contaminant (11.2%, 10/89) of the files in surgical wards. methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was isolated from 6.8% (7/102) of icu patient's files, whereas only 1.1% (1/89) of patient's files in surgical wards were contaminated with mrsa (or, 6.484; 95% ci: 3.215-13.463; p < .0001). the multidrug-resistant p aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serretia marcesens isolated from the patient's files had the same antibiotic  resistance pattern as of these bacteria isolated from the patients. conclusion: the majority of the patient's files in icus were contaminated often with multidrug-resistant bacteria and even mrsa. contaminated files could be a source  of transmission of infection. to prevent this, handwashing practice should be strictly followed after attending the patient and before entering the case notes  in the patient's file. the maintenance of good hand hygiene by the health care workers (hcws) after handling contaminated files should perhaps be the most prudent approach to prevent patient-patient transmission of infection in high-risk areas including icu and surgical wards.

TI  == [beta-lactamases and their role in resistance. part 2: beta-lactamases in 21st century].
AB  == resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics continues to increase, mostly due to the presence of various beta-lakta mases. as a result of the ability of the plasmids  to acquire additional resistance determinants, many of the beta-lactamase producing pathogens became multidrug resistant. the most important beta-lactamases which compomise the use of beta-lactams nowdays are extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, inhibitor-resistant tem and shv beta-lactamases and carbapenemases. carbapenemases are beta-lactamases which hydrolyse carbapenems. they belong to molecular classes a, b, and d. class a comprises carbapenemases sensitive to inhibition by clavulanic acid. most of them are chromosomaly encoded, but some of them are plasmid-mediated such as kpc-1 in  klebsiella pneumoniae and ges-2 in pseudomonas aeruginosa. the class b carbapenemases are metallo-beta-lactamases of the imp or vim group. the class d carbapenemases are the most frequent in acinetobacter baumannii but confer resistance to carbapenems only if other resistance mechanisms such as porin alterations, are present. inhibitor resistant beta-lactamases are one of the most important causes of resistance to beta-lactam-inhibitor combinations. the resistance to these formulations can be also due to hyperproduction of tem-1 beta-lactamase, modifications of the outer membrane proteins or production of oxa-type enzymes. irt enzymes are derived from parenthal tem-1 or tem-2 beta-lactamases by point mutations in the beta-lactamase gene. the frequent use of beta-lactamase inhibitors in hospitals and general practice pose a selection pressure which favours spread of such strains in hospitals and community.

TI  == the threat of antibiotic resistance in gram-negative pathogenic bacteria: beta-lactams in peril!
AB  == beta-lactam antibiotics are the cornerstone of our antibiotic armamentarium. by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, they are highly effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. unfortunately, bacteria have evolved sophisticated resistance mechanisms to combat the lethal effects of beta-lactam antibiotics. pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae are all able to evade killing by penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems. this multi-drug resistant phenotype that challenges health care workers worldwide is caused by an array of resistance determinants. these include altered expression of outer membrane proteins and efflux pumps, along with an increasing arsenal of beta-lactamases. future strategies in beta-lactam design must take into account the complex nature of resistance in gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == combination therapy with intravenous colistin for management of infections due to multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria in patients without cystic fibrosis.
AB  == colistin, an antibiotic almost abandoned for intravenous administration for many  years due to its reported toxicity, has been recently reintroduced in clinical practice due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria and the lack of development of new antibiotics to combat them. to assess the safety and effectiveness of intravenous colistin, in combination with other antimicrobial agents, in the treatment of serious infections in patients without  cystic fibrosis, a retrospective cohort study in a 450-bed tertiary-care hospital in athens, greece, was performed. patients who were hospitalized from 1 october 2000 to 31 january 2004 and received intravenous colistin for more than 72 h were further analyzed. the primary outcome measure was the in-hospital mortality; secondary end points were the clinical outcome of the infections and the occurrence of colistin toxicity. fifty patients received intravenous colistin with a median (mean) daily dose of 3 (4.5) million iu for 16.5 (21.3) days for the management of 54 episodes of infections due to multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria. the predominant infections were pneumonia (33.3%), bacteremia (27.8%), urinary tract infection (11.1%), and intra-abdominal infection (11.1%). the responsible pathogens were acinetobacter baumannii (51.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (42.6%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (3.7%) strains (no pathogen was isolated from one case). in-hospital mortality was 24% (12/50 patients). clinical response (cure or improvement) of the infection was observed  in 66.7% of episodes (36/54). in the studied group, serum creatinine levels were  decreased, at the end of colistin treatment, by an average of 0.2 +/- 1.3 mg/dl compared to baseline levels. deterioration of renal function during colistin therapy was observed in 4/50 patients (8%). coadministration of other antimicrobial agents with spectrum against gram-negative microorganisms and the absence of a control group constitute the major limitations of this study. the use of intravenous colistin for the treatment of infections due to multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria appears to be safe and effective.

AB  == infections caused by multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria, particularly pseudomonas aeruginosa, are increasing worldwide. in patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), resistance in p. aeruginosa to numerous anti-pseudomonal agents is becoming common. the absence since 1995, of new substances active against resistant gram-negative bacteria, has caused increasing concern. colistin, an old antibiotic also known as polymyxin e, has attracted more interest recently because of its significant activity against multi-resistant p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae, and the low resistance rates to it. because its use as an anti-pseudomonal agent was displaced by the potentially less toxic aminoglycosides in 1970s, our knowledge of this drug is limited. however, there has been a significant recent increase in the data gathered on colistin, focussing on its chemistry, antibacterial activity, mechanism of action and resistance, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and new clinical application. it is likely that colistin will be an important antimicrobial option against multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria, for some years to come.

TI  == the optama programme: utilizing mystic (2002) to predict critical pharmacodynamic target attainment against nosocomial pathogens in europe.
AB  == objectives: the optimising pharmacodynamic target attainment using the mystic (meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection) antibiogram (optama) programme identifies antibiotic regimens with the highest probability of attaining critical pharmacodynamic targets, accounting for the inherent variability in pharmacokinetics, dosages and mic distributions. methods: european mic data were obtained from the mystic programme. pharmacodynamic target attainment was calculated by monte carlo simulation for meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. results: significant differences in probability of target attainment  were found, with northern europe demonstrating the highest probabilities of target attainment and eastern europe the lowest. the carbapenems had the highest  target attainments and susceptibility levels across all regions and pathogens. the cephalosporins demonstrated high target attainments and susceptibility results against e. coli and k. pneumoniae in northern and southern europe. piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin had the lowest levels for both parameters in all regions. desirable target attainment was not achieved (except for carbapenems in northern europe) for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa; thus, combination therapy may be appropriate empirical therapy for these pathogens in southern and eastern europe. the closest correlations between target attainment and susceptibility were for meropenem 1 g every 8 h, imipenem 0.5 g every 6 h and ceftazidime 1 g every 8 h. conclusions: the study highlighted significant overestimations between the probability of target attainment and the reported percentage susceptibility, particularly for piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. the approach of the optama programme provides a novel tool which complements susceptibility data to help in the selection of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy.

TI  == device-associated infections and patterns of antimicrobial resistance in a medical-surgical intensive care unit in a university hospital in thailand.
AB  == background: surveillance of nosocomial infection in the intensive care unit (icu) received a high level of attention and outcome indicators are now used in benchmarking the quality of patient care. since 1999 the surveillance has targeted three site-specific, device-associated infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap), central-line-related bloodstream infection (cr-bsi), and catheter-related urinary tract infection (cr-uti). the authors conducted a two-year prospective study on the incidences of these infections acquired in an icu and report herein, together with the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the microorganisms isolated in an icu. patients and method: continuous prospective data collection was conducted on patients admitted to an adult medical-surgical icu of a university hospital in thailand from june 2000 to may 2002. results: a total 1422 patients with a total of 9370 patient-days were enrolled in the study. the incidence of vap, cr-bsi, and cr-uti were 10.8/1000 ventilator-days (95% c.i: 8.5-13.6), 2.6/1000 central-line-days (95%c.i. 1.5-4.4), and 13.8/1000 urinary-catheter-days (95%c.i: 10.7-17.5) respectively. the most common causative pathogens were escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae. the proportion of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa, ceftazidime-resistant a. baumannii, third-generation-cephalosporin-resistant k. pneumoniae, and quinolone-resistant e. coli were 68.8%, 30.9%, 68.5%, 44.6%, 38.3% respectively. conclusion: the incidences of vap and cr-bsi were comparable  to the national nosocomial infection surveillance (nnis) report. but the incidence of cr-uti was over the 90th percentile. the antibiotic resistance had become a serious problem.

TI  == neonatal sepsis in the neonatal intensive care unit: characteristics of early versus late onset.
AB  == neonatal sepsis is a major cause of death in newborns despite sophisticated neonatal intensive care. this retrospective study reviewed the clinical characteristics of cases of culture-proven sepsis in a neonatal intensive care unit from january 1992 to december 2001. patients were divided into those with onset of sepsis in the first 7 days of life (early-onset group) and those with onset after the seventh day of life (late-onset group). a total of 270 cases with 325 episodes of sepsis and 353 isolated pathogens were identified and included in the study. the male-to-female ratio was 1.4. the majority of cases of sepsis occurred in low birth weight (75.9%) and premature babies (76.7%). late onset occurred in 71.9% of cases. patients with late onset had a lower mortality rate than those with early onset (11.3% vs 28.9%). coagulase-negative staphylococci (20.1%) was the most common organism isolated, but infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa was associated with the highest morality rate (55.0%). late-onset sepsis was significantly more common in very low birth weight and premature infants. the most frequently encountered pathogens in the early-onset group were  group b streptococci (gbs) and escherichia coli, while in the late-onset group, the organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterobacteriaceae, including e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and acinetobacter baumannii. gbs infection resulted in the highest mortality when the onset of sepsis was within the first 24 hours of life.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == comparison of trends of resistance rates over 3 years calculated from results for all isolates and for the first isolate of a given species from a patient.
AB  == we compared trends of annual resistance rates calculated from results for all isolates and for the first isolate of staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and acinetobacter baumannii per patient over a 3-year period from 2001 through 2003. antimicrobial susceptibility results of inpatients were extracted from a computerized database. annual resistance rates of a species were calculated by two methods: (i) from results for all isolates, even those from patients with multiple isolates in a given year and (ii) from results for the first isolate from a patient in a given year, regardless of susceptibility profile or specimen type. rates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) did not differ among all isolates (79.9, 78.8 and 79.6%; p = 0.86), but decreased for the first isolate per patient (70.2, 65.7, and 64.1%; p = 0.006) over time. annual duplication rates of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) decreased (39.6, 37.6, and 31.7%; p = 0.01), but those of mrsa increased significantly (64.3, 67.8, and 68.9%; p = 0.004). rates of cefotaxime-resistant k. pneumoniae did not  differ over time by either method, and rates of imipenem-resistant a. baumannii decreased over time by both methods. duplication rates did not differ for either  susceptible or resistant isolates of k. pneumoniae and a. baumannii. the trends in mrsa rate differed by the two methods because of the different proportion of duplicate isolates per year. mrsa rates might be increasingly overestimated for all isolates. these results suggest that the method of calculating results for the first isolate per patient may remove the effect of duplication, allowing the  simple and unambiguous analysis of cumulative susceptibility rates.

TI  == monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacterial isolates from bacteremic patients.
AB  == the aim of the study was to monitor the prevalence of pathogens and development of resistance in bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients. five university clinics and/or regional hospitals in the slovak republic participated in the study and a total of 421 isolates were collected in the second half of the year 2002. the most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (19%), staphylococcus aureus (18.3%), among gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli (13.3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.8%) followed by enterococci, acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter sp. all cons and s. aureus were susceptible to vancomycin; resistance to oxacillin was observed for 55% of the cons and only for 4% of s. aureus isolates. a higher prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and ofloxacin was found in cons in comparison to s. aureus. enterococcus sp. isolates were fully susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. gentamicin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, third generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin showed good activity against e. coli. although 17% of k. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, it was the most effective drug against k. pneumoniae; the prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics was rather higher. gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were the most active against enterobacter sp. isolates and ceftazidime and meropenem against p. aeruginosa.

TI  == trends and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens causing bloodstream infections among febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancy.
AB  == background and purpose: the microbiological spectrum in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia has changed over the past several decades in western countries. the growing incidence of antimicrobial resistance is an inevitable consequence of the widespread use of antibiotics in medical settings. the aim of  this study was to clarify the trends and antimicrobial resistance among pathogens causing bloodstream infections in febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancies. methods: the characteristics of pathogens causing bloodstream infection isolated from patients with febrile neutropenia who were treated at national taiwan university hospital from 1996 to 2001 were reviewed. a total of 1174 pathogens were isolated from 3093 admissions to a hematological ward during  this period. among them, 738 isolates were recovered from patients with febrile neutropenia. results: the majority (93%) of these neutropenic febrile patients had underlying acute leukemia or lymphoma. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 57% of isolated pathogens, followed by gram-positive bacteria (32%), fungi (7%),  and anaerobes (3%). in decreasing frequency, escherichia coli (13%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), and acinetobacter baumannii (5%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria, while coagulase-negative staphylococci (13%), viridans group streptococci (4%), and staphylococcus aureus (4%) were the major gram-positive pathogens. two-thirds (20/30) of s. aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated. resistance to cefotaxime was found in 63% of e. cloacae, 13% of k. pneumoniae and 10% of e. coli. overall, 33% of e. coli and 13% of k. pneumoniae were resistant to ciprofloxacin. conclusions: this study indicates that the microbiological spectrum of microorganisms causing  bloodstream infections in neutropenic febrile patients with hematological malignancies at national taiwan university hospital is different from western countries in that gram-negative bacteria remain the predominant pathogens. antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens is high and e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin are increasing.

TI  == [epidemiology and drug resistance of the pathogenic microbes in the complicated infection of hematological malignancies].
AB  == objective: to investigate the epidemiological characteristics and drug resistance profile of the infection in patients with hematological malignancies. methods: all the microbe strains isolated from the department of hematology in ruijin hospital between 1998 and 2002 were collected for the assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility and the results were analysed by whonet5 software. results: out of the 536 strains isolated in the department of hematology, 230 (42.9%) were gram positive and 301 (56.2%) gram negative organisms. the first 6 strains of gram (-) microbes in frequent order were pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas (xantho) maltophi. the extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbls)  producing rates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were 27.3% and 33.3%, respectively. methylcillin resistant coagulase negative staphylococcus (mrcns) was the most prevalent gram (+) bacteria in the complicated infection patients with hematological malignancies, which accounted for 88.5%. carbapenems  were most sensitive for all of the gram negative bacteria, with a drug resistance rate of 11.4 (5.0% approximately 15.8%) of imipenem. for esbls strains, carbapenems and cefapime were the best choice, with the resistance rate of 46.4%  approximately 94.4% and 50.0% approximately 75.9%, respectively. the drug resistance rate of acinetobacter baumannii was 25.0% approximately 41.3% for the  third generation cephalosporin, 22.7% for the fourth generation cephalosporin and 12.7% for imipenem. pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to carbapenems, with a resistance rate of 12.7% of imipenem; however, it was more sensitive to the third generation cephalosporin. conclusion: antibiotics should be rationally administrated with more considerations to the characteristics of epidemiology and drug resistance profile of the microbes in the given department of hematology.

TI  == resistance rates to commonly used antimicrobials among pathogens of both bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection.
AB  == this study examined the distribution of organisms and their antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted due to acute bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection (uti). during a period of 1 year and 1 month, a total of 201 patients and 253 bacterial isolates were studied. fever higher than 38.5 degrees c was significantly more common in the bacteremic group  than the non-bacteremic group (68% vs 48%; p<0.05). escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis were the most common organisms isolated. e. coli was the leading pathogen and it was significantly more predominant in bacteremic uti than non-bacteremic uti (73% vs 49%; p<0.01).  bacteria other than e. coli (i.e., k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, proteus spp., morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter spp., acinetobacter baumannii, serratia marcescens, and providencia spp.) were more common in non-bacteremic uti than bacteremic uti (44% vs 22%; p<0.01). e. coli isolated from both bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients had a high rate of resistance to ampicillin (80%), cephalothin (59%), gentamicin (29%), piperacillin (61%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (56%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (34%), and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (36%). isolates of p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and  proteus spp. from the non-bacteremic group showed a higher proportion of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (netilmicin and amikacin) and ciprofloxacin. the emergence of a high rate of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) may have an impact on the antibiotic treatment of patients admitted due to acute community-acquired bacteremic or non-bacteremic uti in taiwan. further studies are needed to clarify the impact of antimicrobial  resistance on the outcome in these conditions.

TI  == optimizing pharmacodynamic target attainment using the mystic antibiogram: data collected in north america in 2002.
AB  == the optama program is intended to examine typical antimicrobial regimens used in  the treatment of common nosocomial pathogens and the likelihood of these regimens attaining appropriate pharmacodynamic exposure in different parts of the world. a 5,000-subject monte carlo simulation was used to estimate pharmacodynamic target  attainment for meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. standard dosing  regimens from north america were used. pharmacokinetic parameter variability was  derived from existing healthy volunteer data, and mic data came from the 2002 mystic program. ciprofloxacin displayed the lowest target attainment against all  bacterial species (41 to 46% for a. baumannii, 53 to 59% for p. aeruginosa, and 80 to 85% for the enterobacteriaceae). increasing the dose to 400 mg every 8 h did not significantly increase target attainment against nonfermenters. piperacillin-tazobactam target attainments were similar to that of ceftazidime against all pathogens. higher doses of both compounds were needed to achieve better target attainments against p. aeruginosa. overall, meropenem, imipenem, and cefepime attained the highest probabilities of attainment against the enterobacteriaceae (99 to 100%). the carbapenems appear to be the most useful agents against a. baumannii (88 to 92%), and these agents, along with higher doses of any of the beta-lactams, would be the most appropriate choices for empirical therapy for p. aeruginosa infection. given the lack of agreement between percent susceptibility and probability of target attainment for certain antimicrobial regimens, a methodology employing stochastic pharmacodynamic analyses may be a more useful tool for differentiating the most-optimal compounds and dosing regimens in the clinical setting of initial empirical therapy.

TI  == cefotaximases (ctx-m-ases), an expanding family of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == among the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, the cefotaximases (ctx-m-ases) constitute a rapidly growing cluster of enzymes that have disseminated geographically. the ctx-m-ases, which hydrolyze cefotaxime efficiently, are mostly encoded by transferable plasmids, and the enzymes have been found predominantly in enterobacteriaceae, most prevalently in escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. isolates of vibrio cholerae, acinetobacter baumannii, and aeromonas hydrophila encoding ctx-m-ases have also been reported. the ctx-m-ases belong to the molecular class  a beta-lactamases, and the enzymes are functionally characterized as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. this group of beta-lactamases confers resistance to penicillins, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and monobactams, and the enzymes are inhibited by clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam. typically, the ctx-m-ases hydrolyze cefotaxime more efficiently than ceftazidime, which is reflected in substantially higher mics to cefotaxime than to ceftazidime. phylogenetically, the ctx-m-ases are divided into four subfamilies that seem to have descended from chromosomal beta-lactamases of kluyvera spp. insertion sequences, especially isecp1, have been found adjacent to genes encoding enzymes  of all four subfamilies. the class i integron-associated orf513 also seems to be  involved in the mobilization of blactx-m genes. this review discusses the phylogeny and the hydrolytic properties of the ctx-m-ases, as well as their geographic occurrence and mode of spread.

AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance has become a major health problem in taiwan. while some trends in antimicrobial resistance are universal, others appear to be  unique for specific regions. methods: to determine the distribution and antimicrobial drug resistance of bacterial pathogens in a new hospital in southern taiwan, surveillance data on major bacterial pathogens isolated from chang gung memorial hospital at chia-yi from january 2002 through december 2002 were retrospectively analyzed. results: the most common gram-positive isolate was staphylococcus aureus. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were the two most common gram negative isolates. pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the first among gram-negative, glucose non-fermenting isolates, followed in the order of frequency by acinetobacter baumannii. oxacillin resistance rate of s. aureus was  58%, while vancomycin and teicoplanin remained effective against all of the isolates. the penicillin non-susceptibility rate of streptococcus pneumoniae was  52%, and it is notable that the rate of resistance to erythromycin was 87%. resistance to various antimicrobial agents for p. aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, and gram-negative enteric bacilli was very common in our study. infections caused by multidrug-resistant a. baumannii was not uncommon in this hospital but fortunately, imipenem resistant a. baumannii was rarely encountered. antimicrobial resistance was common in nontyphoid salmonella, s. choleraesuis and serogroup b isolates in particular. conclusion: the high rates of antimicrobial resistance among these major bacterial pathogens in this new hospital are impressive and alarming. judicious use of antimicrobial agents can never be overemphasized. continued surveillance of the changes of resistance patterns over time is necessary.

TI  == epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia in infants after cardiac surgery.
AB  == background: the pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (np) in infants in a pediatric surgical icu after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult icus. study objectives: the primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of np  in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. methods: data were collected between june 1999 and june 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. we retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. results: of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired np after cardiac surgery. the incidence of np was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (chd) compared to simple chd (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). the proportion of late-onset np was higher in patients with complex chd (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). a total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. gram-negative bacilli (gnb) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). the main gnb were acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen gnb were flavobacterium meningosepticum (7  isolates, 8.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). the most commonly seen gram-positive cocci were staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). the frequent fungi were candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). most gnb were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. the bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from k pneumoniae and e coli; the susceptibility of esbl-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. there were one case of methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant s epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. from 1999 to 2002 in infants with np after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant gnb such as a baumanii, p aeruginosa, and k pneumoniae. however, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. early onset episodes of np were frequently caused by haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive s aureus, and other susceptible enterobacteriaceae. conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset np, p aeruginosa, a baumannii, other multiresistant gnb, mrsa, and fungi were the predominant organisms. conclusions: the pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in np in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of gram-positive pathogens as reported by several  adult icus. gnb still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years  in our hospital. there was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of meropenem and imipenem against enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == study objective: to compare the pharmacodynamics of meropenem and imipenem, both  administered as 500 mg every 6 hours, against populations of enterobacteriaceae,  acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. design: ten thousand-subject monte carlo simulation. intervention: variability in total body clearance (clt),  volume of distribution as calculated by the terminal elimination rate (vdbeta), and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) distributions (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, a. baumannii, p. aeruginosa) were derived from the literature for both meropenem and imipenem.  for the free drug concentrations, the percentage of the dosing interval that the  drug concentrations remain above the mic (%t>mic) for each carbapenem-bacteria combination was calculated for 10,000 iterations, substituting a different clt, vdbeta, fraction of unbound drug, and mic into the equation each time based on the probability distribution for each parameter. probabilities of attaining targets of 30%, 50%, and 100% t>mic were calculated. measurements and main results: meropenem free drug %t>mic exposure was significantly greater than that  of imipenem against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, whereas imipenem exposure was greater for a. baumannii. for both agents, free drug %t>mic exposure was greatest against enterobacteriaceae and less for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa. probabilities of target attainment for 30% and 50% t>mic were similar between drugs for most bacteria. at 100% t>mic, meropenem target attainments were greater than those of imipenem against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, and  imipenem attainment was higher for a. baumannii. conclusion: the probability of attaining lower pharmacodynamic targets for most gram-negative bacteria is similar for these carbapenems; however, differences become apparent as the pharmacodynamic requirement increases. further study of the benefits of achieving this pharmacodynamic breakpoint with a higher probability of attaining targets is necessary.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia in a multi-hospital system: differences in microbiology by location.
AB  == objective: to determine whether there were differences in the microbiologic etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia in different clinical settings. design: observational retrospective cohort study of microbiologic etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia from 1998 to 2001 in a multi-hospital system. microbiologic results were compared between hospitals and between different intensive care units (icus) within hospitals. setting: three hospitals--one pediatric teaching hospital, one adult teaching hospital, and one community hospital--in one healthcare system in the midwestern united states. patients: patients at the target hospitals who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia and for whom microbiologic data were available. results: seven hundred fifty-three episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia had culture data available for review. the most common organisms at all hospitals were staphylococcus aureus (28.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (25.2%). the pediatric hospital had higher proportions of escherichia coli (9.5% vs 2.3%; p < .001) and  klebsiella pneumoniae (13% vs 3.1%; p < .001) than did the adult hospitals. in the pediatric hospital, the pediatric icu had higher p aeruginosa rates than did  the neonatal icu (33.3% vs 17%; p = .01). in the adult hospitals, the surgical icu had higher acinetobacter baumannii rates (10.2% vs. 1.7%; p < .001) than did  the other icus. conclusions: microbiologic etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia vary between and within hospitals. knowledge of these differences can improve selection of initial antimicrobial regimens, which may decrease mortality.

TI  == bronchoalveolar interleukin-1 beta: a marker of bacterial burden in mechanically  ventilated patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  == objective: to assess the relationship between concentrations of bronchoalveolar cytokines and bacterial burden (quantitative bacterial count) in intubated patients with a presumptive diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. design: a  cross-sectional and clinical investigation. setting medical/surgical and respiratory intensive care unit of a tertiary 1,200-bed medical center. patients: according to the time course of community-acquired pneumonia at the time of study with bronchoalveolar lavage, 69 mechanically ventilated patients were divided into three subgroups: primary (n = 11), referral (n = 23), and treated (n = 35) community-acquired pneumonia. interventions: bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the most abnormal area on chest radiograph by fiberoptic bronchoscope. bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was processed for quantitative bacterial culture. the concentrations of bronchoalveolar lavage cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and interleukin-10) also were measured. measurements and main results: thirty-two patients had a positive bacterial culture (bronchoalveolar lavage > or = 10 colony-forming units/ml)., and made up 76% of pathogens recovered at high concentrations. the concentrations of bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin-1 beta were 199.1 +/- 32.1 and 54.9 +/- 13.0 pg/ml (mean +/- se) in the patients with positive and negative bacterial culture, respectively (p < .001). bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin- 1 beta was significantly higher in the patients with a high bacterial burden (p < .001), with mixed bacterial infection (p < .001), and with  pneumonia (p < .001), compared with values in patients without these features. the relationship between bacterial load and concentrations of bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin-1 beta was very strong in the patients with primary and referral community-acquired pneumonia but was borderline in treated community-acquired pneumonia. conclusions: the common pathogens were similar to the core pathogens of hospital-acquired pneumonia, probably due to antibiotic effects, delayed sampling, and superimposed nosocomial infection. since the concentration of bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin-1 beta was correlated with bacterial burden in the alveoli, it may be a marker for progressive and ongoing inflammation in patients who have not responded to pneumonia therapy and who have persistence of bacteria in the lung.

TI  == neonatal sepsis: high antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens in a neonatal intensive care unit in karachi.
AB  == objective: to study the bacterial pathogens causing neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity pattern so that guidelines can be prepared for empirical antibiotic therapy. setting: the study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) at pns shifa (naval hospital), karachi during january 1997 to june 1999. methods: blood specimens for culture were drawn from 520 newborns admitted in a nicu with sepsis. the specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth.  subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. the isolates were identified by standard biochemical tests. antibiotic resistance pattern of the isolates was studied by modified kirby baur disc diffusion technique. results: a  total of 212 organisms were isolated. these included staphylococcus aureus (n = 65), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 23), escherichia coli (n = 22), enterobacter cloacae (n = 18), citrobacter diversus (n = 5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and group b streptococcus (n = 2). on antibiotic sensitivity testing, 61.54% of staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. susceptibility to the other common drugs was also quite low while 89.23% of these were susceptible to amikacin and 100% to vancomycin. more than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to ampicillin and co-trimoxazole. resistance to gentamicin was as high as 90.4% for klebsiella pneumoniae; 60.87% for acinetobacter baumannii. resistance to the third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone tested (ciprofloxacin) varied between 25-75%. majority of the isolates were susceptible to meropenem and amikacin. conclusion: in view of the isolation of highly antibiotic resistant organisms, vancomycin in combination with amikacin or a carbapenem is the drug of choice for empirically treating neonatal sepsis.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == association between intensity of chlorhexidine use and micro-organisms of reduced susceptibility in a hospital environment.
AB  == the potential for emergence of resistance to biocides has been a concern in recent years. this study tested whether an association exists between the intensity of chlorhexidine use and chlorhexidine susceptibility of micro-organisms isolated from patients in different clinical areas in an acute-care general hospital. organisms frequently involved in nosocomial infections in the hospital were chosen for study over a six week period: staphylococcus aureus (60 isolates), coagulase-negative staphylococci (48), klebsiella pneumoniae (32), pseudomonas aeruginosa (60), acinetobacter baumannii  (16) and candida albicans (35). an index of chlorhexidine exposure for each clinical unit was derived for the year preceding organism collection. chlorhexidine susceptibility was evaluated using agar incorporation minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and disk diffusion. a statistically significant  inverse correlation was shown between intensity of chlorhexidine use and the overall susceptibility of all study organisms taken together. there was no association when individual taxa were considered. these findings must be interpreted with caution considering that greater use of chlorhexidine is likely  to occur in difficult clinical disciplines where antibiotic use, invasive procedures and other intensive care-related procedures, cross-infection and immunosuppression are all potential confounding factors. there was an excellent correlation between mics and disk testing, suggesting that disk diffusion might be useful in studies involving more than one biocide.

TI  == community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults: the epidemiology, timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and prognostic factors.
AB  == between january 1986 and december 1999, 109 adult patients with culture-proven community-acquired bacterial meningitis were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital. to compare changes over time, the appearance of disease among  our patients was divided into two equal time periods: an earlier time period (1986-1992) and a later time period (1993-1999). in this study, there was a decreasing proportion of community-acquired bacterial meningitis compared with nosocomial bacterial meningitis in adult patients in recent years. its proportion declined dramatically from 81% in the earlier 7 years to 37% in the later 7 years. of the pathogens, klebsiella (k.) pneumoniae was the most frequently implicated pathogen, followed by viridans (v.) streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. other rare organisms including acinetobacter baumannii, salmonella group b and d, proteus mirabilis, group b, d, and non-a, non-b and non-d streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci emerged during the second period. there was a decrease in the mortality rate from 44% in the first to 34% in the second time period, but the overall mortality rate remained high. of the implicated pathogens, patients infected with v. streptococci had a consistently favorable prognosis, while a dramatic decrease in the mortality rate of those infected with k. pneumoniae was seen in recent years. in the multiple logistic regression analysis, only the presence of septic shock and seizures was independently associated with mortality. the timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, as defined by consciousness level, was a major determinant of survival and neurological outcomes for patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis, and the first dose of an appropriate antibiotic should be administrated before a patient's consciousness deteriorates  to a glasgow coma scale score lower than 10.

TI  == ruptured mycotic aneurysm of the iliac artery complicated by emphysematous psoas  muscle abscess: report of two cases.
AB  == emphysematous psoas muscle abscess has rarely been described and has not been reported to be associated with ruptured mycotic aneurysm. we report two cases of  ruptured mycotic iliac arterial aneurysm complicated by emphysematous abscess of  the left psoas muscle. case 1 occurred in a 70-year-old man and case 2 in a 63-year-old woman. both patients presented with fever for several weeks. clinical clues leading to the diagnosis included a palpable abdominal mass with (case 2) or without (case 1) pulsation, blurring of the psoas muscle shadow with abnormal  gas distribution on the plain abdominal film (case 1), and peripheral vascular insufficiency and salmonella bacteremia (case 2). ruptured mycotic aneurysm of the left iliac artery complicated with left psoas muscle abscess was clearly demonstrated by abdominal computerized tomography scan and intravenous digital subtraction angiography in both cases. causative agents, multi-drug resistant acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae, unusual pathogens for mycotic  arterial aneurysm, were cultured from debrided tissue in case 1, and this finding led to the speculation that the infection was hospital-acquired. the favorable outcome in case 2 resulted from early vascular surgery and a prolonged course of  effective antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == antibiotic resistance as an indicator of bacterial chlorhexidine susceptibility.
AB  == the antibiotic and chlorhexidine (chx) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus (not mrsa), streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (mbc) and/or minimal inhibitory (mic) concentrations. non-fermentative bacteria tolerated chx at high concentrations; gram-positive cocci, especially s. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. we found a good correlation between chx and  antibiotic susceptibility in both mic and mbc among gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in mbc among gram-positive bacteria. resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate  increased chx resistance among gram-negative bacteria. this finding gives clinicians the ability to predict chx susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.

TI  == emerging carbapenemases in gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == carbapenemases may be defined as beta-lactamases that significantly hydrolyze at  least imipenem or/and meropenem. carbapenemases involved in acquired resistance are of ambler molecular classes a, b, and d. class a, clavulanic acid-inhibited carbapenemases are rare. they are either chromosomally encoded (nmc-a, sme-1 to sme-3, imi-1) in enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, or plasmid encoded, such as kpc-1 in klebsiella pneumoniae and ges-2 in pseudomonas aeruginosa, the latter being a point-mutant of the clavulanic acid-inhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ges-1. the class b enzymes are the most clinically significant carbapenemases. they are metalloenzymes of the imp or vim  series. they have been reported worldwide but mostly from south east asia and europe. metalloenzymes, whose genes are plasmid and integron located, hydrolyze virtually all beta-lactams except aztreonam. finally, the class d carbapenemases  are increasingly reported in acinetobacter baumannii but compromise imipenem and  meropenem susceptibility only marginally. the sources of the acquired carbapenemase genes remain unknown, as does the relative importance of the spread of epidemic strains as opposed to the spread of plasmid- or integron-borne genes. because most of these carbapenemases confer only reduced susceptibility to carbapenems in enterobacteriaceae, they may remain underestimated as a consequence of the lack of their detection.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == recent developments in carbapenems.
AB  == carbapenems are beta-lactam antibiotics characterised by the presence of a beta-lactam ring with a carbon instead of sulfone in the 4-position of the thyazolidinic moiety. the first carbapenem to be utilised in therapy was imipenem, the n-formimidoyl derivative of thienamycin. imipenem is coadministered with cilastatin, an inhibitor of human renal dehydropeptidase i, as imipenem is hydrolysed by this enzyme. meropenem was the first carbapenem with a 1-beta-methyl group and 2-thio pyrrolidinyl moiety, which renders this antibiotic stable to renal dehydropeptidase i. other carbapenems for parenteral administration later discovered include biapenem, panipenem, ertapenem, lenapenem, e-1010, s-4661 and bms-181139. carbapenems which are orally administered include sanfetrinem, dz-2640, cs-834 and gv-129606. carbapenems have an ultra-broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and stability to almost all clinically relevant beta-lactamases. this differentiates them from all other currently available classes of beta-lactam antibiotics. however, class b beta-lactamases, along with some rare class a and d enzymes, are able to hydrolyse these antibiotics. although class b enzymes are generally chromosomally-encoded (isolated from stenotrophomonas maltophilia, aeromonas spp., bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, flavobacterium spp. and legionella gormanii), plasmid-metallo-beta-lactamases now are appearing in b. fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and members of enterobacteriaceae such as serratia marcescens and klebsiella pneumoniae. the number of these enzymes compared to the number of other beta-lactamase types is still low, however, it is likely that they will spread due to the increased selective pressure of carbapenem use. the very broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity associated with a good clinical efficacy and a favourable safety profile makes the carbapenems valuable as 'first-line' antibiotics in initial empirical therapy for the treatment of severe infections.

TI  == current status of antimicrobial resistance in taiwan.
AB  == while some trends in antimicrobial resistance rates are universal, others appear  to be unique for specific regions. in taiwan, the strikingly high prevalence of resistance to macrolides and streptogramin in clinical isolates of gram-positive  bacteria correlates with the widespread use of these agents in the medical and farming communities, respectively. the relatively low rate of enterococci that are resistant to glycopeptide does not parallel the high use of glycopeptides and extended-spectrum beta-lactams in hospitals. the evolving problem of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates is substantial, and some unique enzymes have been found. recently, some gram-negative bacteria (e.g., pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii) that are resistant to all available antimicrobial agents including carbapenems have emerged.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in gram-negative isolates from european intensive care units: data from the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection  (mystic) programme.
AB  == susceptibility data were collected for 6243 gram-negative isolates from 29 european icus participating in the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme (1997-2000). the most commonly isolated bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.5%), escherichia coli (19.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10.4%), and enterobacter cloacae (7.7%). the incidence of  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producers was higher in turkish, russian and italian icus (27.9-39.6%) than in other countries (2.5-10.8%). the frequency of ampc-cephalosporin hyper-producers was 16.8-55.4%. meropenem was more active against proteus mirabilis than imipenem (99.0% versus 88.8% susceptibility, respectively). against acinetobacter baumannii, meropenem (79.6% susceptible) and imipenem (82.2%) were more active than comparators (34.3-51.6%). meropenem and imipenem exhibited good activity against p. aeruginosa (76.1% and 68.2%, respectively; but with inter-country variation). ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli and k. pneumoniae increased and needs close monitoring. meropenem (98.2-99.8% susceptibility) and imipenem (88.8-99.4%) remained potent against important species of gram-negative bacteria from european icus actively using meropenem.

TI  == antibiotic policy: a tool for controlling resistance of hospital pathogens.
AB  == multiresistant gram-negative bacilli, including strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter spp, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, resistant to broad spectrum beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, are recovered at increasing frequency from patients suffering from nosocomial infections, particularly from those receiving intensive care. the emergence and spread of resistant pathogens to endemic and epidemic levels has frequently been  related in time and place to the intensive use of antibiotics to which these microorganisms have developed resistance, notably third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. recent investigations have indicated that the prevalence of resistance can be reduced by scheduled changes of empiric treatment regimens, involving discontinuation of intensively prescribed drugs and substitution with newly introduced antibiotics of another class to which the prevalent resistant strains remain susceptible. among these drugs, penicillins---beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, 'fourth generation' cephalosporins and, where little used previously, fluoroquinolones, have been introduced successfully in high risk units where ceftazidime-resistant strains of k.pneumoniae, enterobacter and citrobacter spp or glycopeptide-resistant enterococci had become highly prevalent. however, these studies do not demonstrate a direct causal relationship between changes in prescribing practices and ecological improvements, because their observational design cannot be controlled. in most studies, several important factors influencing the dynamics of resistance were not monitored and the relative contribution of decreased emergence versus control of cross-transmission to the improved susceptibility rates is not clear. we propose  that additional long-term studies are required to better track the ecological impact and to determine the optimal modalities of programmed changes of antibiotic prescribing as an antibiotic resistance prevention or control strategy.

TI  == multicenter surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens in intensive care units in 2000 in taiwan.
AB  == a susceptibility surveillance study of 1,274 bacterial isolates recovered from various clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (icus) of five major teaching hospitals was carried out from march, 2000, to june, 2000, in taiwan. this study demonstrated a high rate (66%) of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (orsa), a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (intermediate, 50% and highly resistant, 8%), and high rates of cefotaxime nonsusceptibility for s. pneumoniae (intermediate, 29% and resistant, 4%), enterobacter cloacae (57%), serratia marcescens (34%), and citrobacter freundii (60%). high rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility for pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%), and high rates of imipenem nonsusceptibility for p. aeruginosa (15%) and acinetobacter baumannii (22%) were also found. the percentage (11.9%) of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli was greater than that (11.3%) for klebsiella pneumoniae. rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin nonsusceptibility for s. pneumoniae (42%), enterococcus faecium (71%), and orsa (39%) were high, but no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in this study. the resistance rates of some pathogen varied by institution or type of icus. surveillance for antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens in hospitals, particularly in icu settings with a preexisting higher resistance burden, is mandatory in establishing and/or modifying guidelines for empirical treatment of severe infections in icu patients caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

TI  == present situation of antimicrobial resistance in korea.
AB  == resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. in korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, class c beta-lactamase-producing e. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa present new threats in korea.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in china.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. a total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. the mic of cefpiramide for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). fifty-one percent (26/51) of enterobacter cloacae  isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against e. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. cefpiramide was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. cefpiramide-resistant p. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant s. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 2 microg/ml). against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an mic90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. these results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylo-coccus aureus, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae. thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.

TI  == nosocomial antibiotic resistance in multiple gram-negative species: experience at one hospital with squeezing the resistance balloon at multiple sites.
AB  == increased use of antibiotics has led to the isolation of multidrug-resistant bacteria, especially in intensive care units and long-term care facilities. resistance in specific gram-negative bacteria, including klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, is of great concern, because a growing number of reports have documented mechanisms whereby these microorganisms have become resistant to all available antibacterial agents used in therapy. reduction in the selection of these multidrug-resistant bacteria can  be accomplished by a combination of several strategies. these include having an understanding of the genetics of both innate and acquired characteristics of bacteria; knowing resistance potentials for specific antibacterials; monitoring resistance trends in bacteria designated as problematic organisms within a particular institution on a routine basis; modifying antibiotic formularies when  and where needed; creating institutional education programs; and enforcing strict infection-control practices. strategies appropriate for primary prevention of nosocomial resistance may differ from those required for control of existing epidemic or endemic resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities among clinical isolates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria in a taiwanese university hospital.
AB  == infections caused by gram-negative bacteria with resistance to extended-spectrum  cephalosporins require the identification of effective alternative antimicrobial  therapy. to determine the role of other pre-existing or currently available antimicrobial agents in treating infections caused by these multidrug-resistant pathogens, we evaluated the in vitro susceptibilities of these agents in 411 non-duplicate isolates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria recovered between january 1999 and december 1999 in a major teaching hospital in taipei, taiwan. these isolates included cefotaxime-resistant (mics >  or = 2 mg/l) escherichia coli (66 isolates) and klebsiella pneumoniae (77 isolates); cefotaxime-resistant (mics > or = 64 mg/l) enterobacter cloacae (59 isolates), serratia marcescens (52 isolates) and citrobacter freundii (52 isolates); and ceftazidime-resistant (mics > or = 64 mg/l) pseudomonas aeruginosa (50 isolates) and acinetobacter baumannii (55 isolates). overall, carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) had good activity against the cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae tested (>90% of isolates were susceptible). however, carbapenems had limited activity against the ceftazidime-resistant p. aeruginosa  (only 4% of isolates were susceptible) and a. baumannii (51-56% of isolates were  susceptible). among the e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates tested, 33.3% and 58.4%, respectively, exhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype, determined by the double disc method. over 80% of cefotaxime-resistant e. cloacae and c. freundii were susceptible to cefepime, but this agent had limited activity against other bacteria tested. susceptibilities of these isolates to ciprofloxacin varied, ranging from 25% for a. baumannii to 92% for e. cloacae. newer fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin) had equal or less activity against these organisms, except for a. baumannii for which their mic(90)s (8-16 mg/l) were four- to 16-fold less than that of ciprofloxacin (mic(90) 128 mg/l).

AB  == of the 16,024 patients hospitalized from january 1995 to october 1997, 397 (2.4%) acquired nosocomial pneumonia and the aetiological agent was defined in 101 (25%). about 82% developed late onset pneumonia (>7 days of hospitalization). the site of isolation of microorganisms was bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) (49%), blood culture (39%), pleural effusion (10%) and (2%) pulmonary tissue. gram-negative bacteria were responsible for 54% of infections. staphylococcus aureus (34%) was  the most frequent microorganism isolated followed by acinetobacter baumannii (29%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, responsible for 7% of nosocomial pneumonia. monotherapy gave good cover for early onset pneumonia, but  not for late onset pneumonia. based on our selection criteria, ciprofloxacin was  the best monotherapy for early (50%) and late (31%) onset pneumonia. vancomycin plus ciprofloxacin gave cover of 85% of early and 64% of late onset pneumonia. monotherapy with ciprofloxacin and also combination therapy of ciprofloxacin plus vancomycin may be good options as initial empirical therapy for nosocomial pneumonia.

TI  == evaluation of current activities of fluoroquinolones against gram-negative bacilli using centralized in vitro testing and electronic surveillance.
AB  == given the propensity for enterobacteriaceae and clinically significant nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli to acquire antimicrobial resistance, consistent surveillance of the activities of agents commonly prescribed to treat  infections arising from these organisms is imperative. this study determined the  activities of two fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and seven comparative agents against recent clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia using two surveillance strategies: 1) centralized in vitro susceptibility testing of isolates collected from 27 hospital laboratories across the united states and  2) analysis of data from the surveillance network database-usa, an electronic surveillance network comprising more than 200 laboratories nationwide. regardless of the surveillance method, enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa, and a. baumannii demonstrated similar rates of susceptibility to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. susceptibilities to the fluoroquinolones approached or exceeded 90% for all enterobacteriaceae except providencia spp. (</=65%). approximately 70% of p. aeruginosa and 50% of a. baumanii isolates were susceptible to both fluoroquinolones. among s. maltophilia isolates, 50% more isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. overall, the rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility among enterobacteriaceae was 8.7%, with fluoroquinolone resistance rates notably higher among ceftazidime-nonsusceptible  isolates than ceftazidime-susceptible ones. multidrug-resistant isolates were present among all species tested but were most prevalent for klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. no gram-negative isolates resistant only to  a fluoroquinolone were encountered, regardless of species. thus, while levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin have maintained potent activity against enterobacteriaceae, the potential for fluoroquinolone resistance, the apparent association between fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance, and the presence of multidrug resistance in every species examined emphasize the need to  maintain active surveillance of resistance patterns among gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == investigation of an outbreak of gram-negative bacteremia among hematology-oncology outpatients.
AB  == objective: to identify risk factors associated with an outbreak of gram-negative  bacteremia (gnb). setting: a university hospital. patients: hematology-oncology outpatients. design: retrospective case-control study. results: thirty-eight patients developed gnb; 13 patients experienced more than one episode, and eight  blood cultures grew more than one gram-negative organism. the most frequently isolated organisms were stenotrophomonas maltophilia, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, and acinetobacter johnsonii. when the gnb patients (cases) were compared with randomly selected hematology-oncology patients (controls), central venous catheter (cvc) self-care (71% vs 39%; p=.02), and duration of recent hospital stay (median, 15 vs 4 days; p=.01) were identified as risk factors. in a logistic regression model, duration of recent hospital stay was the only risk factor significantly associated with gnb (odds ratio, 1.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.08; p<.02). conclusions: hematology-oncology patients providing their own cvc care who have recently been hospitalized for more than 2  weeks may be at increased risk of gnb. cvcs should be protected from possible environmental contamination in hematologyoncology patients. patients providing their own cvc care should undergo continued rigorous education regarding proper cvc care.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == failure of an automated blood culture system to detect nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == during a 1-year study we observed that both aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles from patients were negative by the bact/alert system during a 7-day incubation period. however, upon subcultivation of negative bottles, growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa was detectable. in an attempt to explain this observation, aerobic bact/alert fan bottles were seeded with a defined inoculum (0.5 mcfarland standard; 1 ml) of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens,  p. aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, or acinetobacter baumannii. half of  the inoculated bottles were loaded into the bact/alert system immediately, and the remainder were preincubated for 4, 8, 16, and 24 h at 36 degrees c. with preincubation all bottles seeded with the enterobacteriaceae signaled positive during the next 1.5 h. organisms in bottles seeded with the nonfermentative species p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii remained undetected by the bact/alert system for 7 days. s. maltophilia was detected if the preincubation time was equal or less than 8 h. without preincubation all bottles seeded with the enterobacteriaceae or nonfermentative species signaled positive. since nonfermentative species seem to enter a state of bacteriostasis within the preincubation period, we reasoned that an unknown factor is consumed. accordingly, a smaller inoculum should allow the detection of nonfermentative species, even after preincubation, and serial dilutions of p. aeruginosa were detected in preincubated bottles. in this case preincubated bottles signaled positive faster than bottles without preincubation. we conclude that all bottles  from clinical settings should be subcultured prior to loading to avoid false negatives. an alternative may be preincubation at room temperature.

TI  == influences of alternate therapy protocol and continuous infectious disease consultation on antibiotic susceptibility in icu.
AB  == in this study, the effects of alternate use of imipenem and cefoperazone/sulbactam(cfp/sul) on antibiotic resistance in the intensive care unit (icu) were investigated. between 1 april 1993 and 1 april 1994, the infectious diseases consultant saw patients when required and there was no alternative therapy for antibiotics. for the following 2 years, the same consultant followed up each patient from admission to discharge by daily visits to the icu and an alternative therapy protocol was initiated. the most common microorganisms were found to be acinetobacter baumannii and staphylococcus aureus, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively, in the two periods. this study demonstrated that sensitivity rates  of imipenem, ciprofloxacin and aminoglycosides were improved as a result of this  protocol.

TI  == impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. however, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. from 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens to 22 agents. linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing d, decreasing %s) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing d, increasing %s). the mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing d, decreasing %s and decreasing d, increasing %s relationships. multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.

TI  == resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in adult gram-negative bacillary meningitis.
AB  == ninety-three patients with gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm) were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital, over a period of 12 years.  among them, eight showed resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, accounting for 9% of the total gnbm cases and 29% of the postneurosurgical gnbm cases. the resistant pathogens included acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and morganella morganii. these eight patients, six males and two females aged 18-61 years, all had nosocomially acquired meningitis associated with head trauma and/or postneurosurgical states. six patients received imipenem/cilastatin treatment; five survived and one died. the  other two expired because they did not receive appropriate antibiotic treatment.  although third-generation cephalosporin-resistant gnbm is rare, its incidence has been increasing over the past 5 years. in patients with nosocomially-acquired postneurosurgical gnbm, the presence of third-generation cephalosporin resistance should therefore be highly suspected. the appropriate choice of antibiotic is essential for their survival.

TI  == korean nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of bacteria in 1997.
AB  == antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are known to be prevalent in tertiary-care hospitals in korea. twenty hospitals participated to this surveillance to determine the nationwide prevalence of resistance bacteria in 1997. seven per cent and 26% of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were resistant to 3rd-generation cephalosporin. increased resistance rates, 19% of acinetobacter baumannii to ampicillin/sulbactam, and 17% of pseudomonas aeruginoa to imipenem,  were noted. the resistance rate to fluoroquinolone rose to 24% in e. coli, 56% in a. baumannii and 42% in p. aeruginosa. mean resistance rates were similar in all  hospital groups: about 17% of p. aeruginosa to imipenem, 50% of haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin, 70% of staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, and 70% of pneumococci to penicillin. in conclusion, nosocomial pathogens and problem resistant organisms are prevalent in smaller hospitals too, indicating nosocomial spread is a significant cause of the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria  in korea.

TI  == bacteriological monitoring in the prague burns center.
AB  == the microbiological aspect of the prevention of nosocomial infections at the burn center consists primarily in the surveillance of bacterial flora and its antibiotical resistance. the prague burn center is regularly monitoring the microbial flora. patients are examined not only by the conventional methods of taking swabs of burned sites, but also by printing method, which allows a semiquantitative assessment of the colonization of burned areas. simultaneously,  investigation of bacterial contamination in the external environment of the department is carried out and the colonization of nursing staff is investigated.  in all isolated strains the sensitivity to antibiotics is examined; this is significant from the point of view of current knowledge about therapeutic possibilities and for the antibiotic policy. the typing of bacterial strains makes possible to determine their epidemiological markers, and thus to investigate their spread within the department. the most frequent isolate is s. aureus and the prevalence of mrsa is relatively high. among gramnegative rods the strains of p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae are most often isolated. various typing methods revealed endemic spread of particular strains of rarely isolated species (e. agglomerans, s. marcescens, a. baumannii, etc.).

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

AB  == a one year prospective, observational survey was performed to evaluate the abnormal carriage of multi-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae and/ or acinetobacter  baumannii, to determine associated risk factors for carriage, and to correlate the abnormal carriage with infectious morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit (icu) of a university hospital. two hundred and ninety-eight patients who stayed in the icu > 48h, and were not neutropenic, were studied. salivary and rectal samples were obtained on admission and weekly until discharge. out of 265  evaluable patients, 88 (33%) developed oropharyngeal and/or rectal carriage within a median of nine days. three factors were significantly associated with abnormal carriage: higher 'severity of illness' score on admission, a threefold increase in icu stay, and the need for mechanical ventilation. k. pneumoniae or a. baumannii accounted for 57/158 (36%) of all icu-acquired infections (in 46 patients). they were considered as secondary endogenous infections (sei) in 42 patients who were previously colonized with the same strains, and developed infection within a median of three days (range 0-68 days). prolonged stay in icu  was the only factor associated with sei in the carrier population. mortality was  significantly greater in the carrier group (43 vs 25%, p = 0.0006). post hoc stratification suggested that abnormal carriage only influenced mortality in patients showing a low severity of illness score on admission to icu. abnormal carriage was found in the most severely ill patients, predisposed to secondary nosocomial infections, and could influence mortality in the less severely ill.

AB  == objectives: antibiotic susceptibility of 649 gram-negative bacilli involved in severe infections and isolated in 18 teaching hospitals from january to december  1992 was evaluated. methods: minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution method for piperacillin, piperacillin+ tazobactam and imipenem, and by a microdilution method for 11 other antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin, ciprofloxacin,  fosfomycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin). criteria of comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie were followed for interpretation. betalactamases were identified by isoelectric focusing and overproduction of cephalosporinase was defined by the resistance phenotype. the main species isolated were escherichia coli (45%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8%), salmonella spp. (7.5%), enterobacter cloacae (4%) and klebsiella oxytoca (4%). most of the strains were isolated from blood culture (72.3%), respiratory tract (11.4%) and intraabdominal infections (8.6%). most of  the enterobacteria isolates were susceptible to imipenem, aztreonam, amikacin and ciprofloxacin (percentages of susceptibility were respectively 99.3, 98, 98.3 and 96.3); in most of cases clavulanic acid did not entirely restore sensitivity to amoxicillin of penicillinase-producing strains. among 89 p. aeruginosa strains, 82% were susceptible to imipenem and ceftazidime, 81% to the association piperacillin + tazobactam and 51% to ticarcillin. resistance rates are very high  for acinetobacter baumannii except for imipenem. conclusion: production of tem-type penicillinase and over-production of the chromosomal cephalosporinase are the most widely observed mechanisms of resistance (respectively 22% and 9% of 649 strains). prevalence of extended spectrum betalactamases was low (1%) and essentially observed for k. pneumoniae.

TI  == [nosocomial infections: new agents, incidence, prevention].
AB  == nosocomial infection is one of the major health problems confronting clinicians in intensive care units. incidence has been estimated to vary from 5 to 10%, leading to death in one of every 5000 persons hospitalized. this situation is not however static since hospital epidemics and nosocomial infections evolve as a consequence of advances in antibiotic drug therapy and surgical and intensive care techniques. microbial investigations themselves are of major importance as the collection of epidemiological data and its communication to hospital partners affects their approach to patient management. nosocomial pneumonia, particularly  in ventilated patients, urinary infection in those with indwelling catheters and  wound colonization after surgery are still major problems and explain part of the variations between wards and hospitals. the main changes concern the bacteria involved. classical agents with new mechanisms of resistance (klebsiella pneumoniae, extended spectrum beta-lactamase producers) have been joined by other "new" agents emerging as pathogens (xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter baumannii). the incidence of resistance in staphylococcus and enterococcus strains as well as new gram positive species including corynebacterium jeikeium and rhodococcus equi, now recognized as opportunistic agents, has also increased. the multiresistance of these pathogens is often responsible for failure of antibiotic therapy and emphasizes the need both for rigorous prevention through active cooperation between bacteriologists, ward clinicians and intensive care units, and further research in the fields of microbial resistance mechanisms and  antibiotics. preventive measures have become a priority creating an international challenge to health care policy makers.

AB  == the in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. the bacteria studied were staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), escherichia coli, salmonella species, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and bacteroides fragilis. in contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (mic90s) were < 1 microgram/ml against most tested species. ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin  were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. all fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, with mic90s < or = 1 microgram/ml. for methicillin-resistant strains, on  the other hand, the mic90s were > or = 4 micrograms/ml. there was no significant  difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and  -resistant s. epidermidis. sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against b. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. the mic90s of most quinolones assayed against k. pneumoniae, citrobacter spp., e. cloacae, s. aureus and s. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == activity of imipenem, third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and ciprofloxacin against multi-resistant gram-negative bacilli isolated from chilean hospitals.
AB  == the activity of imipenem against nosocomial strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp. and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus resistant to some third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, or ciprofloxacin was assessed. these strains represent the most prevalent multi-resistant nosocomial microorganisms in chile since they were isolated from clinical specimens in 11 chilean hospitals. a high proportion of the strains were resistant to several beta-lactams, yet all strains of k. pneumoniae and acinetobacter spp. were susceptible to imipenem; resistance was exhibited by only one strain of p. aeruginosa and 16 strains of s. aureus. synergy between cefotaxime and clavulanic acid was found in almost all strains of k. pneumoniae, suggesting the presence of plasmid-coded beta-lactamases, probably with extended-spectrum activity. killing a. baumannii by imipenem was rapid, but  slower for p. aeruginosa. killing of k. pneumoniae was also somewhat slower despite the lower mic of imipenem for this strain. bactericidal activity was even slower against one strain of methicillin-resistant s. aureus. these results suggest that imipenem would be an adequate alternative to other broad-spectrum agents in the treatment of infections due to nosocomial multi-resistant gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == opportunistic nosocomial multiply resistant bacterial infections--their treatment and prevention.
AB  == one of the most difficult problems confronting the clinician who deals with nosocomial infections is that of microbial resistance. the predominant nosocomial infections (urinary tract infections, pneumonia, septicaemia, surgical wound infections) involve increasing numbers of gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus  epidermidis, corynebacterium jeikeium or resistant enterococci as well as new multiresistant gram-negative bacilli such as xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter baumannii and alcaligenes xylosoxydans. the emergence and spread of klebsiella pneumoniae and other enterobacteriaceae producing novel plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases active against third-generation cephalosporins contribute to the difficulty in treating nosocomial infections.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adults: a recent six-year experience.
AB  == thirty-eight cases of gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adults have been identified over the past six years at the veterans general hospital, taipei. twenty cases were associated with head trauma and/or neurosurgery, while 18 cases occurred spontaneously. the overall mortality was 58%. within the spontaneous meningitis group, 13 cases (72%) were due to klebsiella pneumoniae, 11 cases (61%) were associated with bacteremia and eight cases (44%) with diabetes mellitus. in spite of the administration of third-generation cephalosporins, most cases of spontaneous meningitis (15 patients, 83%) died soon after diagnosis. in  contrast, the clinical course for the postneurosurgical patients was more benign. only seven patients (35%) died during the course of therapy. common causative agents in postneurosurgical patients included pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and escherichia coli. external cerebrospinal fluid drainage devices were thought to be the most important predisposing factor in gram-negative bacillary meningitis in the postneurosurgical patients. factors that adversely influenced the mortality of gram-negative bacillary meningitis included the presence of bacteremia, shock, deep coma and a high initial cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte count.

TI  == ru 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester hr 916. i. antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  == the aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin ru 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester hr 916. ru 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. against methicillin-sensitive staphylococci ru 29 246 (mic90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. ru 29 246 inhibited hemolytic streptococci of the serogroups a, b, c and g as well as penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (mic90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). mic90s of ru 29 246 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella spp., shigella spp.,  proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. only ru 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). most strains of pseudomonas spp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., hafnia alvei and bacteroides spp. were resistant to ru 29 246. ru 29 246 killed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times mic. the ph value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of ru 29 246. ru 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.
