TI  == acidaminococcus intestini sp. nov., isolated from human clinical samples.
AB  == eleven strains of a hitherto unknown, gram-negative, anaerobic coccus were recovered from various human clinical samples of patients hospitalized in two geographically distant french hospitals. these strains displayed the morphology and growth characteristics of those related to the genus acidaminococcus. the clinical isolates shared at least 99.9 and 99.7 % of their nucleotide positions in the 16s and 23s rrna gene sequences, respectively. they displayed 95.6 and 88.9 % 16s and 23s rrna gene sequence similarities, respectively, with acidaminococcus fermentans. the 16s rrna-based phylogeny revealed that all the clinical isolates grouped in a statistically well supported cluster separate from a. fermentans. enzymic activity profiles as well as metabolic end product patterns, including propionic acid production, differentiated the novel bacteria  from a. fermentans. finally, phenotypic, genotypic and phylogenetic data, including large-scale chromosome structure and dna g+c content, supported the proposal of a novel species of the genus acidaminococcus, for which the name acidaminococcus intestini sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is adv 255.99(t)  (=aip 283.01(t)=cip 108586(t)=ccug 50930(t)).
