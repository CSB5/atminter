TI  == detection of zoonotic pathogens and characterization of novel viruses carried by  commensal rattus norvegicus in new york city.
AB  == norway rats (rattus norvegicus) are globally distributed and concentrate in urban environments, where they live and feed in closer proximity to human populations than most other mammals. despite the potential role of rats as reservoirs of zoonotic diseases, the microbial diversity present in urban rat populations remains unexplored. in this study, we used targeted molecular assays to detect known bacterial, viral, and protozoan human pathogens and unbiased high-throughput sequencing to identify novel viruses related to agents of human disease in commensal norway rats in new york city. we found that these rats are infected with bacterial pathogens known to cause acute or mild gastroenteritis in people, including atypical enteropathogenic escherichia coli, clostridium difficile, and salmonella enterica, as well as infectious agents that have been associated with undifferentiated febrile illnesses, including bartonella spp., streptobacillus moniliformis, leptospira interrogans, and seoul hantavirus. we also identified a wide range of known and novel viruses from groups that contain  important human pathogens, including sapoviruses, cardioviruses, kobuviruses, parechoviruses, rotaviruses, and hepaciviruses. the two novel hepaciviruses discovered in this study replicate in the liver of norway rats and may have utility in establishing a small animal model of human hepatitis c virus infection. the results of this study demonstrate the diversity of microbes carried by commensal rodent species and highlight the need for improved pathogen  surveillance and disease monitoring in urban environments. importance: the observation that most emerging infectious diseases of humans originate in animal  reservoirs has led to wide-scale microbial surveillance and discovery programs in wildlife, particularly in the developing world. strikingly, less attention has been focused on commensal animals like rats, despite their abundance in urban centers and close proximity to human populations. to begin to explore the zoonotic disease risk posed by urban rat populations, we trapped and surveyed norway rats collected in new york city over a 1-year period. this analysis revealed a striking diversity of known pathogens and novel viruses in our study population, including multiple agents associated with acute gastroenteritis or febrile illnesses in people. our findings indicate that urban rats are reservoirs for a vast diversity of microbes that may affect human health and indicate a need for increased surveillance and awareness of the disease risks associated with urban rodent infestation.

TI  == gastrointestinal microbiota-mediated control of enteric pathogens.
AB  == the gastrointestinal (gi) microbiota is a complex community of microorganisms residing within the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. the gi microbiota is vital  to the development of the host immune system and plays a crucial role in human health and disease. the composition of the gi microbiota differs immensely among  individuals yet specific shifts in composition and diversity have been linked to  inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, atopy, and susceptibility to infection. in this review, we describe the gi microbiota and its role in enteric diseases caused by pathogenic escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, and clostridium difficile. we discuss the central role of the gi microbiota in protective immunity, resistance to enteric pathogens, and resolution of enteric colitis.

TI  == can rapid integrated polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostics for gastrointestinal pathogens improve routine hospital infection control practice? a diagnostic study.
AB  == background: every year approximately 5000-9000 patients are admitted to a hospital with diarrhoea, which in up to 90% of cases has a non-infectious cause.  as a result, single rooms are 'blocked' by patients with non-infectious diarrhoea, while patients with infectious diarrhoea are still in open bays because of a lack of free side rooms. a rapid test for differentiating infectious from non-infectious diarrhoea could be very beneficial for patients. objective: to evaluate masscode multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the simultaneous diagnosis of multiple enteropathogens directly from stool, in terms  of sensitivity/specificity to detect four common important enteropathogens: clostridium difficile, campylobacter spp., salmonella spp. and norovirus. design: a retrospective study of fixed numbers of samples positive for c. difficile (n =  200), campylobacter spp. (n = 200), salmonella spp. (n = 100) and norovirus (n =  200) plus samples negative for all these pathogens (n = 300). samples were sourced from nhs microbiology laboratories in oxford and leeds where initial diagnostic testing was performed according to public health england methodology.  researchers carrying out masscode assays were blind to this information. a questionnaire survey, examining current practice for infection control teams and  microbiology laboratories managing infectious diarrhoea, was also carried out. setting: masscode assays were carried out at oxford university hospitals nhs trust. further multiplex assays, carried out using luminex, were run on the same  set of samples at leeds teaching hospitals nhs trust. the questionnaire was completed by various nhs trusts. main outcome measures: sensitivity and specificity to detect c. difficile, campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., and norovirus. results: nucleic acids were extracted from 948 clinical samples using  an optimised protocol (200 campylobacter spp., 199 c. difficile, 60 s. enterica,  199 norovirus and 295 negative samples; some samples contained more than one pathogen). using the masscode assay, sensitivities for each organism compared with standard microbiological testing ranged from 43% to 94% and specificities from 95% to 98%, with particularly poor performance for s. enterica. relatively large numbers of unexpected positives not confirmed with quantitative pcr were also observed, particularly for s. enterica, giardia lamblia and cryptosporidium  spp. as the results indicated that s. enterica detection might provide generic challenges to other multiplex assays for gastrointestinal pathogens, the luminex  xtag((r)) gastrointestinal assay was also run blinded on the same extracts (937/948 remaining) and on re-extracted samples (839/948 with sufficient material). for campylobacter spp., c. difficile and norovirus, high sensitivities (> 92%) and specificities (> 96%) were observed. for s. enterica, on the original masscode/oxford extracts, luminex sensitivity compared with standard microbiological testing was 84% [95% confidence interval (ci) 73% to 93%], but this dropped to 46% on a fresh extract, very similar to masscode, with a corresponding increase in specificity from 92% to 99%. overall agreement on the per-sample diagnosis compared with combined microbiology plus pcr for the main four/all pathogens was 85.6%/64.7%, 87.0%/82.9% and 89.8%/86.8% for the masscode  assay, luminex assay/masscode extract and luminex assay/fresh extract, respectively. luminex assay results from fresh extracts implied that 5% of samples did not represent infectious diarrhoea, even though enteropathogens were  genuinely present. managing infectious diarrhoea was a significant burden for infection control teams (taking 21% of their time) and better diagnostics were identified as having major potential benefits for patients. conclusions: overall, the luminex xtag gastrointestinal panel showed similar or superior sensitivity and specificity to the masscode assay. however, on fresh extracts, this test had  low sensitivity to detect a key enteric pathogen, s. enterica; making it an unrealistic option for most microbiology laboratories. extraction efficiency appears to be a major obstacle for nucleic acid-based tests for this organism, and possibly the whole enterobacteriaceae family. to improve workflows in service microbiology laboratories, to reduce workload for infection control practitioners, and to improve outcomes for nhs patients, further research on deoxyribonucleic acid-based multiplex gastrointestinal diagnostics is urgently needed. funding: the health technology assessment programme of the national institute for health research.

TI  == discovery of selective inhibitors of the clostridium difficile dehydroquinate dehydratase.
AB  == a vibrant and healthy gut flora is essential for preventing the proliferation of  clostridium difficile, a pathogenic bacterium that causes severe gastrointestinal symptoms. in fact, most c. difficile infections (cdis) occur after broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment, which, by eradicating the commensal gut bacteria, allows its spores to proliferate. hence, a c. difficile specific antibiotic that spares  the gut flora would be highly beneficial in treating cdi. towards this goal, we set out to discover small molecule inhibitors of the c. difficile enzyme dehydroquinate dehydratase (dhqd). dhqd is the 3(rd) of seven enzymes that compose the shikimate pathway, a metabolic pathway absent in humans, and is present in bacteria as two phylogenetically and mechanistically distinct types. using a high-throughput screen we identified three compounds that inhibited the type i c. difficile dhqd but not the type ii dhqd from bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a highly represented commensal gut bacterial species. kinetic analysis revealed that the compounds inhibit the c. difficile enzyme with ki values ranging from 10 to 20 microm. unexpectedly, kinetic and biophysical studies demonstrate that inhibitors also exhibit selectivity between type i dhqds, inhibiting the c. difficile but not the highly homologous salmonella enterica dhqd. therefore, the three identified compounds seem to be promising lead compounds for the development of c. difficile specific antibiotics.

TI  == how enteric pathogens know they hit the sweet spot.
AB  == evaluation of: ng km, ferreyra ja, higginbottom sk et al. microbiota-liberated host sugars facilitate post-antibiotic expansion of enteric pathogens. nature 502(7469), 96-99 (2013). the human gut microbiota is a complex system of commensal microorganisms required for normal host physiology. disruption of this  protective barrier by antibiotics creates opportunities for enteric pathogens to  establish infections. although the correlation between the use of antibiotics and enteric infections have been known for some time, the specific signals that allow enteric pathogens to recognize a susceptible host have not been determined. in a  recent article, ng et al. demonstrated that the expansion of both salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile infections is enhanced by the availability  of host-specific sugars liberated from the intestinal mucus by commensal bacteria. these results show how antibiotic removal of specific species from the  gut microbiome allows symbiotic functions to be hijacked by pathogenic species.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == antipathogenic activity of probiotics against salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile in anaerobic batch culture systems: is it due to synergies  in probiotic mixtures or the specificity of single strains?
AB  == probiotics are currently being investigated for prevention of infections caused by enteric pathogens. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of three single probiotics: lactobacillus casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), lactobacillus acidophilus ncimb 30184 (pxn 35), bifidobacterium breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) and a probiotic mixture containing the above strains plus twelve other strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera on the survival of salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile using ph-controlled anaerobic batch cultures containing mixed faecal bacteria. changes in relevant bacterial groups and effects of probiotic addition on survival of the two pathogens were assessed over 24 h. quantitative analysis of bacterial populations revealed that there was a significant increase in lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria numbers, depending on  probiotic addition, compared with the control (no added probiotic). there was also a significant reduction in s. typhimurium and c. difficile numbers in the presence of certain probiotics compared with controls. of the probiotic treatments, two single strains namely l. casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), and b. breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) were the most potent in reducing the numbers of s. typhimurium and c. difficile. in addition, the supplementation with probiotics into the systems influenced some fermentations parameters. acetate was found in the largest concentrations in all vessels and lactate and formate were generally  detected in higher amounts in vessels with probiotic addition compared to controls.

TI  == growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == background: the growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria  were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. method: a microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate  the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the test materials against the organisms. results: delta-3-carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of gram-positive bacteria (clostridium difficile atcc 9689, clostridium paraputrificum atcc 25780, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 12600) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 11775 and bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), 0.18-0.70 mg/ml) except for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 13311 (mic, 2.94 mg/ml). the mic of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/ml against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against c. difficile (0.70 mg/ml); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/ml) and 4 (5.80 mg/ml) against c. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/ml), 4 (12.0 mg/ml), and 7 (0.70 mg/ml) against c. perfringens); compound 1 against e. coli (7.20 mg/ml) and s. enterica serovar typhimurium (12.0 mg/ml). overall, all of the constituents were  less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (mic, 0.063-0.25 mg/ ml). the lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium clostridium butyricum atcc 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (b. fragilis and e. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. beneficial gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria was not observed. scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. conclusion: a. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == microbiota-liberated host sugars facilitate post-antibiotic expansion of enteric  pathogens.
AB  == the human intestine, colonized by a dense community of resident microbes, is a frequent target of bacterial pathogens. undisturbed, this intestinal microbiota provides protection from bacterial infections. conversely, disruption of the microbiota with oral antibiotics often precedes the emergence of several enteric  pathogens. how pathogens capitalize upon the failure of microbiota-afforded protection is largely unknown. here we show that two antibiotic-associated pathogens, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium) and clostridium difficile, use a common strategy of catabolizing microbiota-liberated mucosal carbohydrates during their expansion within the gut. s. typhimurium accesses fucose and sialic acid within the lumen of the gut in a microbiota-dependent manner, and genetic ablation of the respective catabolic pathways reduces its competitiveness in vivo. similarly, c. difficile expansion is aided by microbiota-induced elevation of sialic acid levels in vivo. colonization of gnotobiotic mice with a sialidase-deficient mutant of bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a model gut symbiont, reduces free sialic acid levels resulting in c. difficile downregulating its sialic acid catabolic pathway and exhibiting impaired expansion. these effects are reversed by exogenous dietary administration of free sialic acid. furthermore, antibiotic treatment of conventional mice induces a spike in free sialic acid and mutants of both salmonella and c. difficile that are unable to catabolize sialic acid exhibit impaired expansion. these data show that antibiotic-induced disruption of the resident microbiota and subsequent alteration in mucosal carbohydrate availability are exploited by these two distantly related enteric pathogens in a  similar manner. this insight suggests new therapeutic approaches for preventing diseases caused by antibiotic-associated pathogens.

TI  == intestinal alkaline phosphatase prevents antibiotic-induced susceptibility to enteric pathogens.
AB  == objective: to determine the efficacy of oral supplementation of the gut enzyme intestinal alkaline phosphatase (iap) in preventing antibiotic-associated infections from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium) and clostridium difficile. background: the intestinal microbiota plays a pivotal role in human health and well-being. antibiotics inherently cause dysbiosis, an imbalance in the number and composition of intestinal commensal bacteria, which leads to susceptibility to opportunistic bacterial infections. previously, we have shown that iap preserves the normal homeostasis of intestinal microbiota and that oral supplementation with calf iap (ciap) rapidly restores the normal gut flora. we hypothesized that oral iap supplementation would protect against antibiotic-associated bacterial infections. methods: c57bl/6 mice were treated with antibiotic(s) +/- ciap in the drinking water, followed by oral gavage of s.  typhimurium or c. difficile. mice were observed for clinical conditions and mortality. after a defined period of time, mice were killed and investigated for  hematological, inflammatory, and histological changes. results: we observed that  oral supplementation with ciap during antibiotic treatment protects mice from infections with s. typhimurium as well as with c. difficile. animals given iap maintained their weight, had reduced clinical severity and gut inflammation, and  showed improved survival. conclusions: oral iap supplementation protected mice from antibiotic-associated bacterial infections. we postulate that oral iap supplementation could represent a novel therapy to protect against antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad), c. difficile-associated disease (cdad), and other enteric infections in humans.

TI  == a culture-independent sequence-based metagenomics approach to the investigation of an outbreak of shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli o104:h4.
AB  == importance: identification of the bacterium responsible for an outbreak can aid in disease management. however, traditional culture-based diagnosis can be difficult, particularly if no specific diagnostic test is available for an outbreak strain. objective: to explore the potential of metagenomics, which is the direct sequencing of dna extracted from microbiologically complex samples, as an open-ended clinical discovery platform capable of identifying and characterizing bacterial strains from an outbreak without laboratory culture. design, setting, and patients: in a retrospective investigation, 45 samples were  selected from fecal specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea during the 2011 outbreak of shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli (stec) o104:h4 in germany. samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (august-september 2012), followed by a 3-phase analysis (november 2012-february 2013). in phase 1, a de novo assembly approach was developed to obtain a draft genome of the outbreak strain. in phase 2, the depth of coverage of the outbreak strain genome was determined in each sample. in phase 3, sequences from each sample were compared with sequences from known bacteria to identify pathogens other than the outbreak  strain. main outcomes and measures: the recovery of genome sequence data for the  purposes of identification and characterization of the outbreak strain and other  pathogens from fecal samples. results: during phase 1, a draft genome of the stec outbreak strain was obtained. during phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered from 10 samples at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26 samples at greater than 1-fold coverage. sequences from the shiga-toxin genes were detected  in 27 of 40 stec-positive samples (67%). in phase 3, sequences from clostridium difficile, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter concisus, and salmonella enterica  were recovered. conclusions and relevance: these results suggest the potential of metagenomics as a culture-independent approach for the identification of bacterial pathogens during an outbreak of diarrheal disease. challenges include improving diagnostic sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and reducing costs.

TI  == toll-like receptor 5-dependent immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a recombinant fusion protein vaccine containing the nontoxic domains of clostridium difficile toxins a and b and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium flagellin in a mouse model of clostridium difficile disease.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a spore-forming bacillus that produces toxin-mediated enteric disease. c. difficile expresses two major virulence factors, toxin a (tcda) and toxin b (tcdb). human and animal studies demonstrate a clear association between humoral immunity to these toxins and protection against c. difficile infection (cdi). the receptor binding-domains (rbds) of tcda and tcdb are known to be immunogenic. here, we tested the immunoadjuvant properties of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium flagellin (flic) subunit d1 as an innate  immune agonist expressed as a recombinant fusion vaccine targeting the rbds of tcda and tcdb in mice. intraperitoneally immunized mice developed prominent anti-tcda and anti-tcdb immunoglobulin g in serum. the protective efficacy of the recombinant vaccines, with or without an adjuvant, was tested in a mouse model of cdi that closely represents the human disease. following intraperitoneal immunization equivalent to two doses of toxoid a and toxoid b vaccine adjuvanted  with alum and oral challenge with c. difficile vpi 10463, c57bl/6 mice were able  to mount a protective immune response that prevented diarrhea and death compared  to mice immunzed with alum alone. these results are significantly different from  those for control mice (p < 0.001). these results provide evidence that a recombinant protein-based vaccine targeting the rbds of the c. difficile toxins adjuvanted with s. typhimurium flagellin can induce rapid, high-level protection  in a mouse model of cdi when challenged with the homologous strain from which the vaccine antigens were derived and warrant further preclinical testing against clinically relevant c. difficile strains in the mouse and hamster models of cdi.

TI  == structural insight into the clostridium difficile ethanolamine utilisation microcompartment.
AB  == bacterial microcompartments form a protective proteinaceous barrier around metabolic enzymes that process unstable or toxic chemical intermediates. the genome of the virulent, multidrug-resistant clostridium difficile 630 strain contains an operon, eut, encoding a bacterial microcompartment with genes for the breakdown of ethanolamine and its utilisation as a source of reduced nitrogen and carbon. the c. difficile eut operon displays regulatory genetic elements and protein encoding regions in common with homologous loci found in the genomes of other bacteria, including the enteric pathogens salmonella enterica and enterococcus faecalis. the crystal structures of two microcompartment shell proteins, cd1908 and cd1918, and an uncharacterised protein with potential enzymatic activity, cd1925, were determined by x-ray crystallography. cd1908 and  cd1918 display the same protein fold, though the order of secondary structure elements is permuted in cd1908 and this protein displays an n-terminal beta-strand extension. these proteins form hexamers with molecules related by crystallographic and non-crystallographic symmetry. the structure of cd1925 has a cupin beta-barrel fold and a putative active site that is distinct from the metal-ion dependent catalytic cupins. thin-section transmission electron microscopy of escherichia coli over-expressing eut proteins indicates that cd1918 is capable of self-association into arrays, suggesting an organisational role for cd1918 in the formation of this microcompartment. the work presented provides the basis for further study of the architecture and function of the c. difficile eut  microcompartment, its role in metabolism and the wider consequences of intestinal colonisation and virulence in this pathogen.

TI  == increased susceptibility of melanin-concentrating hormone-deficient mice to infection with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == melanin-concentrating hormone (mch) was initially identified in mammals as a hypothalamic neuropeptide regulating appetite and energy balance. however, the wide distribution of mch receptors in peripheral tissues suggests additional functions for mch which remain largely unknown. we have previously reported that  mice lacking mch develop attenuated intestinal inflammation when exposed to clostridium difficile toxin a. to further characterize the role of mch in host defense mechanisms against intestinal pathogens, salmonella enterocolitis (using  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium) was induced in mch-deficient mice and their wild-type littermates. in the absence of mch, infected mice had increased mortality associated with higher bacterial loads in blood, liver, and spleen. moreover, the knockout mice developed more-severe intestinal inflammation, based  on epithelial damage, immune cell infiltrates, and local and systemic cytokine levels. paradoxically, these enhanced inflammatory responses in the mch knockout  mice were associated with disproportionally lower levels of macrophages infiltrating the intestine. hence, we investigated potential direct effects of mch on monocyte/macrophage functions critical for defense against intestinal pathogens. using raw 264.7 mouse monocytic cells, which express endogenous mch receptor, we found that treatment with mch enhanced the phagocytic capacity of these cells. taken together, these findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for mch in host-bacterial interactions.

TI  == soluble plantain fibre blocks adhesion and m-cell translocation of intestinal pathogens.
AB  == dietary fibres may have prebiotic effects mediated by promotion of beneficial bacteria. this study explores the possibility that soluble plant fibre may also improve health by inhibiting epithelial adhesion and translocation by pathogenic  bacteria. we have focussed on soluble non-starch polysaccharide (nsp) from plantain bananas (musa spp.) which previous studies showed to be particularly effective at blocking escherichia coli epithelial adherence. in vitro and ex vivo studies assessed the ability of plantain nsp to inhibit epithelial cell adhesion  and invasion of various bacterial pathogens, and to inhibit their translocation through microfold (m)-cells and human peyer's patches mounted in ussing chambers. plantain nsp showed dose-related inhibition of epithelial adhesion and m-cell translocation by a range of pathogens. at 5mg/ml, a concentration readily achievable in the gut lumen, plantain nsp inhibited adhesion to caco2 cells by salmonella typhimurium (85.0 +/- 8.2%, p<.01), shigella sonnei (46.6 +/- 29.3%, p<.01), enterotoxigenic e.coli (56.1 +/- 23.7%, p<.05) and clostridium difficile  (67.6 +/- 12.3%, p<.001), but did not inhibit adhesion by enteropathogenic e.coli. plantain nsp also inhibited invasion of caco2 cells by s. typhimurium (80.2 +/- 9.7%) and sh. sonnei (46.7 +/- 13.4%); p<.01. plantain nsp, 5mg/ml, also inhibited translocation of s. typhimurium and sh. sonnei across m-cells by 73.3 +/- 5.2% and 46.4 +/- 7.7% respectively (p<.05). similarly, s. typhimurium translocation across peyer's patches was reduced 65.9 +/- 8.1% by plantain nsp (p<.01). soluble plantain fibre can block epithelial adhesion and m-cell translocation of intestinal pathogens. this represents an important novel mechanism by which soluble dietary fibres can promote intestinal health and prevent infective diarrhoea.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of single- and multi-strain probiotics: inter-species inhibition between probiotic strains, and inhibition of pathogens.
AB  == many studies comparing the effects of single- and multi-strain probiotics on pathogen inhibition compare treatments with different concentrations. they also do not examine the possibility of inhibition between probiotic strains with a mixture. we tested the ability of 14 single-species probiotics to inhibit each other using a cross-streak assay, and agar spot test. we then tested the ability  of 15 single-species probiotics and 5 probiotic mixtures to inhibit clostridium difficile, escherichia coli and s. typhimurium, using the agar spot test. testing was done with mixtures created in two ways: one group contained component species incubated together, the other group of mixtures was made using component species  which had been incubated separately, equalised to equal optical density, and then mixed in equal volumes. inhibition was observed for all combinations of probiotics, suggesting that when used as such there may be inhibition between probiotics, potentially reducing efficacy of the mixture. significant inter-species variation was seen against each pathogen. when single species were  tested against mixtures, the multi-species preparations displayed significantly (p < 0.05 or less) greater inhibition of pathogens in 12 out of 24 cases. despite evidence that probiotic species will inhibit each other when incubated together in vitro, in many cases a probiotic mixture was more effective at inhibiting pathogens than its component species when tested at approximately equal concentrations of biomass. this suggests that using a probiotic mixture might be  more effective at reducing gastrointestinal infections, and that creating a mixture using species with different effects against different pathogens may have a broader spectrum of action that a single provided by a single strain.

TI  == high incidence of campylobacter concisus in gastroenteritis in north jutland, denmark: a population-based study.
AB  == the incidence of non-thermophilic campylobacter species was assessed in an unselected population-based study in a mixed urban and rural community in north jutland, denmark. in a 2-year study period, 11,314 faecal samples from 8302 patients with gastroenteritis were cultured with supplement of the filter method. we recovered a high incidence of campylobacter concisus (annual incidence 35/100,000 inhabitants), almost as high as the common campylobacter jejuni/coli.  in contrast, there was a very low incidence of other non-thermophilic campylobacter species, such as campylobacter upsaliensis. campylobacter concisus  was, unlike c. jejuni/coli, found more frequently among small children (<1 year)  and the elderly (>/= 65 years). around 10% of the patients with c. consisus had co-infections dominated by clostridium difficile and salmonella enterica, whereas co-infections occurred in about 5% of c. jejuni/coli patients. we observed a seasonal variation in c. jejuni/coli with a peak incidence in late summer months  and autumn, whereas there was an almost constant monthly prevalence of c. concisus. among patients participating in a questionnaire sub-study, there was a  higher degree of close contacts with animals, especially dogs, as well as a higher travel exposure among c. jejuni/coli patients compared with c. concisus patients. we did not culture any c. concisus in stool samples from a small cohort of healthy individuals. future studies have to focus on the clinical follow-up and the long-term risk of inflammatory bowel diseases in c. concisus-positive patients. we conclude that there is a high incidence of c. concisus in denmark.

AB  == aims: to evaluate the diversity and antimicrobial activity present among pseudovibrio spp. isolated from marine sponges. methods and results: seventy-three bacterial isolates from the marine sponges polymastia boletiformis, axinella dissimilis and haliclona simulans were identified as pseudovibrio spp. using phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences. genetic diversity among these isolates was estimated using random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd), and 33 rapd types were identified among the 73 pseudovibrio isolates. these pseudovibrio spp. were assayed for the production of compounds with antimicrobial activity against various clinically relevant pathogens. sixty-two (85%) of the isolates showed activity against at least one of the pathogens tested, including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and clostridium difficile. pcr screens of the pseudovibrio isolates also revealed the presence of potential  antibiotic-producing polyketide synthase genes. conclusions: marine sponges harbour a diverse population of pseudovibrio spp., the majority of which demonstrate antimicrobial activity. the identification of several different antimicrobial activity spectra suggests that the pseudovibrio isolates may produce a suite of antimicrobial compounds. significance and impact of the study: this is the first study in which an extended population of pseudovibrio isolates  from marine sponges has been analysed and establishes the little-studied pseudovibrio as a potentially important genus in the search for antimicrobial compounds of clinical relevance.

TI  == five commercial dna extraction systems tested and compared on a stool sample collection.
AB  == in this study, 5 different commercial dna extraction systems were tested on a stool sample collection containing 81 clinical stool specimens that were culture-positive for diarrheagenic escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enterica, or clostridium difficile. the purified dnas were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) directed toward the relevant organisms. the results showed that conventional pcr combined with the extraction systems biorobot ez1 (qiagen, hilden, germany), bugs'n beads (genpoint, oslo, norway), chargeswitch (invitrogen, paisley, uk), qiaamp stool mini kit (qiagen), and 2 protocols (generic and specific a) for easymag (biomerieux, marcy i'etoile, france) were able to identify 89%, 62%, 85%, 88%, 85%, and 91%, respectively, of  the pathogens originally identified by conventional culture-based methods. when taqman pcr was combined with the easymag specific a protocol, 99% of the samples  were correctly identified. the results demonstrate that the extraction efficiencies can vary significantly among different extraction systems, careful optimization may have a significant positive effect, and the use of sensitive and specific detection methods like taqman pcr is an ideal choice for this type of analysis.

TI  == insights into the mechanism of type i dehydroquinate dehydratases from structures of reaction intermediates.
AB  == the biosynthetic shikimate pathway consists of seven enzymes that catalyze sequential reactions to generate chorismate, a critical branch point in the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids. the third enzyme in the pathway, dehydroquinate dehydratase (dhqd), catalyzes the dehydration of 3-dehydroquinate  to 3-dehydroshikimate. we present three crystal structures of the type i dhqd from the intestinal pathogens clostridium difficile and salmonella enterica. structures of the enzyme with substrate and covalent pre- and post-dehydration reaction intermediates provide snapshots of successive steps along the type i dhqd-catalyzed reaction coordinate. these structures reveal that the position of  the substrate within the active site does not appreciably change upon schiff base formation. the intermediate state structures reveal a reaction state-dependent behavior of his-143 in which the residue adopts a conformation proximal to the site of catalytic dehydration only when the leaving group is present. we speculate that his-143 is likely to assume differing catalytic roles in each of its observed conformations. one conformation of his-143 positions the residue for the formation/hydrolysis of the covalent schiff base intermediates, whereas the other conformation positions the residue for a role in the catalytic dehydration  event. the fact that the shikimate pathway is absent from humans makes the enzymes of the pathway potential targets for the development of non-toxic antimicrobials. the structures and mechanistic insight presented here may inform  the design of type i dhqd enzyme inhibitors.

TI  == recognition and prevention of hospital-associated enteric infections in the intensive care unit.
AB  == the objectives of this article were to review the causes and extent of hospital-associated infectious diarrhea and associated risks in the general hospital ward and intensive care unit (icu), to compare microorganisms with similar symptoms to aid in recognition that will lead to timely and appropriate treatment and control measures, and to propose infection prevention protocols that could decrease human process errors in the icu. this literature review describes epidemiology, comparison of microbial characteristics for potential hospital-associated enteric pathogens, diagnosis, and prevention, especially if important in the icu, and particularly in regard to clostridium difficile. enteric organisms that most commonly cause hospital-associated infectious diarrhea in acute care settings and the icu are c. difficile, rotavirus, and norovirus, although others may also be important, particularly in developing countries. to recognize and control infectious diarrhea successfully in the icu,  intensivists should be aware that epidemiology, risks, and prevention measures may differ between these microorganisms. in addition, intensivists should be ready to implement systems changes related to notification, isolation precautions and prevention, and environmental cleaning in the icu.

TI  == enteric bacterial pathogens with zoonotic potential isolated from farm-raised deer.
AB  == the raising of captive white-tailed deer (odocoileus virginianus) is a growing agricultural industry in ohio as it is in several other areas of the united states and around the world. pooled fecal samples were collected from 30 white-tailed deer confinement facilities. samples were cultured for five enteric  bacterial pathogens. premise prevalence rates were as follows: escherichia coli o157, 3.3%; listeria monocytogenes, 3.3%; salmonella enterica, 0%; yersinia enterocolitica, 30%; and clostridium difficile, 36.7%. the ail virulence gene could not be amplified from any of the y. enterocolitica isolates recovered. toxigenic strains of c. difficile polymerase chain reaction ribotype 078, an emerging c. difficile genotype of humans and food animals, were recovered from 4  of 11 (36.4%) c. difficile-positive deer farms. venison from farm-raised deer might become contaminated with foodborne pathogens, deer farmers may have occupational exposure to these zoonotic agents, and farm-raised deer could be a reservoir from which the environment and other livestock may become contaminated  with a number of potentially zoonotic bacteria.

TI  == development of a dna microarray to detect antimicrobial resistance genes identified in the national center for biotechnology information database.
AB  == to understand the mechanisms and epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance (ar), the genetic elements responsible must be identified. due to the myriad of possible genes, a high-density genotyping technique is needed for initial screening. to achieve this, ar genes in the national center for biotechnology information genbank database were identified by their annotations and compiled into a nonredundant list of 775 genes. a dna microarray was constructed of 70mer  oligonucelotide probes designed to detect these genes encoding resistances to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, chloramphenicols, glycopeptides, heavy metals, lincosamides, macrolides, metronidazoles, polyketides, quaternary ammonium compounds, streptogramins, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprims as well as resistance transfer genes. the microarray was validated with two fully sequenced control strains of salmonella enterica: typhimurium lt2 (sensitive) and typhi ct18 (multidrug resistance [mdr]). all resistance genes encoded on the mdr  plasmid, phcm1, harbored by ct18 were detected in that strain, whereas no resistance genes were detected in lt2. the microarray was also tested with a variety of bacteria, including mdr salmonella enterica serovars, escherichia coli, campylobacter spp., enterococcus spp., methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, listeria spp., and clostridium difficile. the results presented here demonstrate that a microarray can be designed to detect virtually all ar genes found in the national center for biotechnology information database, thus reducing the subsequent assays necessary to identify specific resistance gene alleles.

TI  == is rotavirus contributing to an increase of diarrhoea in a region of spain?
AB  == diarrhoeal illnesses are the most frequent of notifiable diseases in aragon. physicians notify diarrhoea cases with presumed infectious origin on a weekly basis. following an increase in 2005-2006, we aimed to identify the responsible organism(s) in order to inform control measures. we described seasonality of diarrhoea notifications for 1998-2004 and 2005-2006. we calculated correlations between diarrhoea notifications and enteric pathogens diagnosed in two aragonese  laboratories, and applied linear regression using coefficients of determination (r2). in 2005-2006 the winter peak of diarrhoea notifications increased from 2494 to 3357 weekly cases (34.6%) and the peak in rotavirus diagnoses from 15 to 39 weekly cases. the correlation of diarrhoea notifications with rotavirus was 0.05  in 1998-2004 and 0.42 in 2005-2006. the model for 1998-2004 included salmonella enterica, giardia lamblia and clostridium difficile (r2=0.08) and for 2005-2006 rotavirus and astrovirus (r2=0.24). our results suggest that rotavirus contributed to the increase of diarrhoea notifications. we recommend determining  the disease burden of rotavirus in order to guide vaccination policies.

TI  == reduction in infection risk through treatment of microbially contaminated surfaces with a novel, portable, saturated steam vapor disinfection system.
AB  == background: surface-mediated infectious disease transmission is a major concern in various settings, including schools, hospitals, and food-processing facilities. chemical disinfectants are frequently used to reduce contamination, but many pose significant risks to humans, surfaces, and the environment, and all must be properly applied in strict accordance with label instructions to be effective. this study set out to determine the capability of a novel chemical-free, saturated steam vapor disinfection system to kill microorganisms,  reduce surface-mediated infection risks, and serve as an alternative to chemical  disinfectants. methods: high concentrations of escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), salmonella enterica, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, ms2 coliphage (used as a surrogate for nonenveloped viruses including norovirus), candida albicans, aspergillus niger, and the endospores of clostridium difficile were dried individually onto porous clay test surfaces. surfaces were treated with the saturated steam vapor disinfection system for brief periods and then numbers of surviving microorganisms were determined. infection risks were calculated from the kill-time data using microbial dose-response relationships published in the scientific literature, accounting for surface-to-hand and hand-to-mouth transfer efficiencies. results:  a diverse assortment of pathogenic microorganisms was rapidly killed by the steam disinfection system; all of the pathogens tested were completely inactivated within 5 seconds. risks of infection from the contaminated surfaces decreased rapidly with increasing periods of treatment by the saturated steam vapor disinfection system. conclusions: the saturated steam vapor disinfection system tested for this study is chemical-free, broadly active, rapidly efficacious, and  therefore represents a novel alternative to liquid chemical disinfectants.

TI  == [infectious aetiologies of travelers' diarrhoea].
AB  == traveler's diarrhoea (td) occurs in 20 to 60% of european or north-american travelers in intertropical areas. following return from endemic zone, malaria must always be evocated in front of febrile diarrhoea. many causative infectious  agents are involved in td and their frequency may vary according to destination and seasons. the main agents involved in td are escherichia coli pathovars (especially enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative e. coli) followed by enteroinvasive bacteria (campylobacter spp., shigella spp., salmonella enterica), enteric viruses (norovirus, rotavirus) and protozoa (gardia intestinalis, cryptosporidium parvum et entamoeba histolytica). the development of molecular biology methods as pcr may allow us to evaluate the relative frequency of these agents and especially of viral agents in td. protozoa and microsporidia are more  frequently isolated in persistent and chronic td, especially in compromised patients. a complete etiological research in routine microbiology laboratories is difficult and time-consuming, related to the high diversity of causative agents and the need for specific methods. implementation of laboratory diagnosis is highly recommended when diarrhoea is associated with fever or presence of blood in stools, immunosuppression, antibiotic treatment (clostridium difficile toxins) or in case of persistent/chronic diarrhoea. according to the high frequency of acquired antibiotic-resistance in enteric bacteria, an antibiogram must be performed for all causative bacterial agents.

TI  == saccharomyces cerevisiae strain 905 reduces the translocation of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium and stimulates the immune system in gnotobiotic and conventional mice.
AB  == previous results in the laboratory of the authors showed that saccharomyces cerevisiae strain 905, isolated during 'cachaca' production, was able to colonize and survive in the gastrointestinal tract of germ-free and conventional mice, and to protect these animals against oral challenge with salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium or clostridium difficile. in the present work, the effects of s. cerevisiae 905 on the translocation of salm. typhimurium (mesenteric lymph nodes, peyer's patches, spleen, liver) as well as on the immune system (number of kupffer cells, immunoglobulin production, clearance of escherichia coli b41) were evaluated in gnotobiotic and/or conventional mice. the treatment with the yeast reduced significantly the translocation of salm. typhimurium to liver in gnotobiotic animals and to all the organs tested in conventional mice. the number of kupffer cells per 100 hepatocytes in liver was significantly higher (p<0.05) in yeast mono-associated mice (52.9+/-15.7) than in germ-free controls (38.1+/-9.0). probably as a consequence, clearance of e. coli b41 from the bloodstream was more efficient in yeast mono-associated animals when compared to  germ-free mice. higher levels (p<0.05) of secretory iga in intestinal content and of iga and igm in serum were observed in yeast mono-associated mice when compared to germ-free group. concluding, the protection against pathogenic bacteria observed in a previous study was probably due to a modulation of both local and systemic immunity of mice treated with s. cerevisiae 905.

TI  == effect of tea phenolics and their aromatic fecal bacterial metabolites on intestinal microbiota.
AB  == tea is rich in polyphenols and other phenolics that have been widely reported to  have beneficial health effects. however, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. in this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-o-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like clostridium spp., bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. this indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. the bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by probiotic strains modify the adhesion of probiotics and enteropathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == exopolysaccharides (epss) are exocellular polymers present in the surface of many bacteria, including lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. the genome sequence of several strains revealed the presence of eps-encoding genes. however, the physiological role that epss play in the bacterial ecology still remains uncertain. in this study, we have assessed the effect of epss produced by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, bifidobacterium longum nb667, and bifidobacterium animalis ipla-r1 on the adhesion of probiotic and enteropathogen strains to human intestinal mucus. the eps fraction gg had no significant effect on the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg and b. animalis ipla-r1. however, the eps fractions nb667 and  ipla-r1 significantly reduced the adherence of both probiotic strains. in contrast, the three eps fractions increased the adhesion of enterobacter sakazakii atcc 29544 and escherichia coli nctc 8603. higher adherence of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 29631 and clostridium difficile atcc 9689 was detected in the presence of the eps fractions gg and nb667. in general,  these effects were obtained at eps concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml, and they were eps dose dependent. the competitive exclusion of probiotics in the presence of eps could suggest the involvement of these biopolymers in the adhesion to mucus.  the increase in the adherence of enteropathogens could be explained if components of the pathogen surface are able to bind to specific epss and the bound epss are  able to adhere to mucus. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting the effect of epss from probiotics on bacterial adhesion properties.

TI  == adhesion properties and competitive pathogen exclusion ability of bifidobacteria  with acquired acid resistance.

TI  == short communication: effect of exopolysaccharide isolated from "viili" on the adhesion of probiotics and pathogens to intestinal mucus.
AB  == the strong ropy character of the scandinavian fermented milk viili is conferred by the exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by lactococcal strains. these biopolymers can be responsible for some health benefits. we have assessed the influence of the eps fraction isolated from commercial viili on the adhesion of some probiotics and pathogens to human intestinal mucus. concentrations of viili  eps greater than 0.1 mg/ml promoted a decrease in adherence of bifidobacterium lactis bb12 and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and this effect was dose-dependent. however, no modifications were detected on the adhesion levels of the pathogenic  strains tested at a concentration of 1 mg/ml of eps. results obtained in the present work should be considered in the design of new probiotic products.

TI  == screening of yeasts as probiotic based on capacities to colonize the gastrointestinal tract and to protect against enteropathogen challenge in mice.
AB  == probiotics are defined as viable microorganisms that exhibit a beneficial effect  on the host's health when they are ingested. two important criteria are used for  selection of probiotic microorganisms: they must be able to survive in the gastrointestinal environment and to present at least one beneficial function (colonization resistance, immunomodulation or nutritional contribution). generally, in vitro assays demonstrating these properties were used to select probiotics but it is unclear if the data can be extrapolated to in vivo conditions. in the present work, twelve saccharomyces cerevisiae strains isolated from different environments (insect association, tropical fruit, cheese and "aguardente" production) and pre-selected for in vitro resistance to simulated gastrointestinal conditions were inoculated in germ-free mice to evaluate their real capacity to colonize the mammal digestive tract. using these data, one of the yeasts (s. cerevisiae 905) was selected and tested in gnotobiotic (gn) and conventional (cv) mice for its capacity to protect against oral challenge with two enteropathogenic bacteria (salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile). the yeast reached populational levels potentially functional in the gastrointestinal portions where the enteropathogens tested act. no antagonism against either pathogenic bacterium by the yeast was observed in the digestive tract of gn mice but, after challenge with s. typhimurium, mortality was lower and liver tissue was better preserved in cv animals treated with the yeast when compared with a control group (p<0.05). histopathological results of intestines showed that the yeast also presented a good protective effect against oral challenge with c. difficile in gn mice (p<0.05). in conclusion, among the 12 s. cerevisiae tested, strain 905 showed the best characteristics to be used as a probiotic as demonstrated by survival capacity in the gastrointestinal tract and  protective effect of animals during experimental infections.

TI  == developmental control of endocytosis in dendritic cells by cdc42.
AB  == dendritic cells (dcs) developmentally regulate antigen uptake by controlling their endocytic capacity. immature dcs actively internalize antigen. however, mature dcs are poorly endocytic, functioning instead to present antigens to t cells. we have found that endocytic downregulation reflects a decrease in endocytic activity controlled by rho family gtpases, especially cdc42. blocking cdc42 function by toxin b treatment or injection of dominant-negative inhibitors  of cdc42 abrogates endocytosis in immature dcs. in mature dcs, injection of constitutively active cdc42 or microbial delivery of a cdc42 nucleotide exchange  factor reactivates endocytosis. dcs regulate endogenous levels of cdc42-gtp with  activated cdc42 detectable only in immature cells. we conclude that dcs developmentally regulate endocytosis at least in part by controlling levels of activated cdc42.

AB  == the c-terminal repeat domain of clostridium difficile toxin a harbors toxin-neutralizing epitopes and is considered to be a candidate component of a vaccine against c. difficile-associated disease (cdad). fourteen of the 38 c-terminal toxin a repeats (14cdta) were cloned into ptech-1 in frame with the immunogenic fragment c of tetanus toxin (tetc) to generate plasmid p56tetc. expression of the tetc-14cdta fusion protein was driven from the anaerobically inducible nirb promoter within attenuated salmonella typhimurium brd509 (aroa arod). the tetc-14cdta fusion protein was purified and shown to bind to known toxin a receptors found on the surface of rabbit erythrocytes. intranasal (i.n.)  and intragastric (i.g.) immunization with 10(7) and 10(10) cfu, respectively, of  brd509(p56tetc) generated significant (p < 0.05) anti-toxin a serum responses after a single dose. antibody titers were elevated following a boosting dose with either live vaccine or a subcutaneous injection of 0.5 microgram of purified 14cdta protein. importantly, serum from mice immunized with brd509(p56tetc) neutralized toxin a cytotoxicity. both i.n. and i.g. immunizations also generated toxin a-specific immunoglobulin a on the pulmonary and intestinal mucosa, respectively. intranasal vaccination induced consistently higher serum and mucosal anti-toxin a antibody responses. significant anti-tetanus toxoid serum and mucosal antibodies were also generated by both immunization routes. the availability of live attenuated salmonella typhi for human use may allow the development of a multivalent mucosal vaccine against cdad, tetanus, and typhoid.

TI  == yield from stool testing of pediatric inpatients.
AB  == objectives: to quantify the yield from stool testing in pediatric inpatients and  to identify criteria to test stool more deliberately without sacrificing diagnostic sensitivity. design: a retrospective review was performed of all stool cultures, ova and parasite examinations, and clostridium [correction of clostridia] difficile toxin assays performed on pediatric inpatients, aged 3 days to 18 years, at thomas jefferson university hospital, philadelphia, pa, for 1 year. medical records were reviewed for positive cases, each with 2 controls matched for age and test type. for this study, the term admission refers to the interval between the times each patient was admitted to and discharged from the hospital. some patients had multiple stool tests sent to the laboratory during a  single admission; some patients had more than 1 admission during the study period. statistical analysis was performed using x2 analysis and the student 2-tailed t test with a commercially available statistical software package (statworks, cricket software, philadelphia). results: of 250 patient admissions to the hospital for which stool was cultured, 7 cultures (2.8%) were positive. of 63 patient admissions having ova and parasite testing, 1 (2%) had a positive result. clostridium [correction of clostridia] difficile toxin assays were performed on 40 patient admissions to the hospital, and 7 (18%) had a positive result. only 18 (3.0%) of 598 of all test results reviewed were positive. costs of negative test results totaled $26,084. more patients (71%) with positive stool cultures than control patients (21%) had a temperature higher than or equal to 38 degrees c (x2, p < .05); however, relying on this sign missed 29% of the children with bacterial infection. a white blood cell band count of at least 0.10 was 100% sensitive and 79% specific in identifying patients with positive stool culture. there was no statistically significant relationship between stool culture results and age, total white blood cell count or white blood cell segmented neutrophil count, and no relationship between c. difficile toxin assay results and any of the above characteristics. clostridium [correction of clostridia] difficile was the most common pathogen identified (6 of 9) in patients developing gastrointestinal symptoms after admission; however, salmonella enteritidis and shigella sonnei were also significant causes (3 of 9). conclusions: there is low  yield from stool testing of pediatric inpatients: c. difficile toxin assay has the highest yield. clostridium [correction of clostridia] difficile testing is most valuable for children with nosocomial gastrointestinal symptoms although other bacterial pathogens do cause nosocomial symptoms in children. more selective stool testing could help us be more efficient with our patient care resources.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in organisms causing diarrheal disease.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is becoming increasingly important in the treatment of enteric infections, particularly those due to shigella, vibrio cholerae, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (associated with traveler's diarrhea), and salmonella typhi. the rate of antimicrobial resistance is highest in the developing world, where the use of antimicrobial drugs is relatively unrestricted. of greatest immediate concern is the need for an effective, inexpensive antimicrobial that can be used safely as treatment for small children with dysentery due to shigella, primarily shigella dysenteriae type 1.

TI  == [infectious diarrhea].
AB  == infectious diarrhea is a very common, usually self-limited disease. among travellers to developing countries, diarrhea is by far the most common medical problem. the intake of sufficient glucose-electrolyte solutions is the most important step to prevent dehydration. loperamide may be prescribed as a valuable antimotility agent: however, this drug should not be used in patients with high fevers, bloody diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps. stool cultures are recommended in cases without improvement, when clostridium difficile is suspected and when multiple cases occur. antibiotics are indicated for treatment of certain microorganisms, for patients with immunosuppression and in dysenteric syndromes.  they are not recommended for prophylaxis on a routine basis.

TI  == role of infectious agents in exacerbations of ulcerative colitis in india. a study of clostridium difficile.
AB  == fifty patients with idiopathic ulcerative colitis--25 with acute exacerbation of  the disease (group i) and 25 in quiescent phase (group ii)--were studied. none of the patients had a history of recent exposure to antimicrobial drugs or hospitalization. evidence of infection with protozoal and bacterial agents and/or presence of clostridium difficile toxin was demonstrated in eight (32%) patients  in group i and one (4%) patient in group ii (group i vs. group ii, p < 0.05; chi  2 test with yate's correction). in five of the six patients with demonstrable clostridium difficile toxin in the stool, one patient with entamoeba trophozoites, and another with salmonella infection, the exacerbation responded clinically and endoscopically to specific antimicrobial therapy. another two patients who had entamoeba histolytica cysts in the stool had no change in their  clinical status with metronidazole. we conclude that infectious agents are responsible for some of the exacerbations in patients of ulcerative colitis in a  tropical country like india, where careful microbiologic examination is in order  in every acute exacerbation of this disease. this contrasts with the findings in  developed countries.

TI  == in vitro activity of azithromycin (cp-62,993), a novel macrolide, against enteric pathogens.
AB  == azithromycin (cp-62,993 [9-deoxy-9a-methyl-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin]) is a novel macrolide antimicrobial. in this study the in vitro activity of cp-62,993 has been determined against selected enteropathogens, including clostridium difficile, and compared with that of erythromycin. mics were determined using an  agar incorporation technique in mueller-hinton medium, containing saponin-lysed horse blood at a final concentration of 10% v/v, with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu. cp-62,993 was considerably more active than erythromycin against salmonella typhi (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l, respectively), s. enteritidis (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), shigella flexneri (mic90 2 and 32 mg/l), sh. dysenteriae (mic90 2 and 32 mg/l), sh. sonnei (mic90 4 and 32 mg/l), campylobacter jejuni (mic90 0.12 and 1 mg/l), vibrio cholerae (mic90 0.25 and 8 mg/l), v. parahaemolyticus (mic90 0.5 and 8 mg/l), yersinia enterocolitica (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), escherichia coli-etec (mic90 4 and 32 mg/l), e. coli-eiec  (mic90 4 and greater than 32 mg/l), plesiomonas shigelloides (mic90 1 and 8 mg/l) and aeromonas hydrophila (mic90 4 and 32 mg/l). cp-62,993 (mic90 2 mg/l) was slightly less active than erythromycin (mic90 1 mg/l) against isolates of c. difficile. the results suggest a potential clinical role for cp-62,993 in the treatment of enteric infections where antimicrobial therapy is indicated.
