TI  == [effects of two udp-glucose dehydrogenases on hyaluronic acid biotransformation].
AB  == we amplified genes encoding udp-glucose dehydrogenase, ecohasb from escherichia coli and spyhasb from streptococcus pyogenes. both ecohasb and spyhasb were inserted into t7 expression vector prx2 to construct recombinant plasmids prxeb and prxsb, and to express in e. coli bl21(de3). after nickel column purification  of udp-glucose dehydrogenases, the enzymes were characterized. the optimum reaction condition of spyhasb was at 30 degrees c and ph 10. the specific activity reached 12.2 u/mg under optimum condition. the optimum reaction condition of ecohasb was at 30 degrees c and ph 9. its specific activity reached  5.55 u/mg under optimum condition. the pmuhasa gene encoding hyaluronic acid synthase was amplified from pasteurella multocida and ligated with ecohasb and spyhasb to construct the coexpression vectors pbpaeb and pbpasb, respectively. the co-expression vectors were transformed into e. coli bw25113. hyaluronic acid  (ha) was produced by biotransformation and the conditions were optimized. when recombinant strains were used to produce hyaluronic acid, the higher the activity of udp-glucose dehydrogenase was, the better its stability was, and the higher the ha production could reach. under the optimal conditions, the yields of ha produced by pbpaeb/bw25113 and pbpasb/bw25113 in shake flasks were 1.52 and 1.70  g/l, respectively, and the production increased more than 2-3 folds as previously reported.

TI  == development of colloidal gold immunochromatographic strips for detection of riemerella anatipestifer.
AB  == riemerella anatipestifer is one of the most important bacterial pathogen of ducks and causes a contagious septicemia. r. anatipestifer infection causes serositis syndromes similar to other bacterial infections in ducks, including infection by  escherichia coli, salmonella enterica and pasteurella multocida. clinically differentiating r. anatipestifer infections from other bacterial pathogen infections is usually difficult. in this study, mab 1g2f10, a monoclonal antibody against r. anatipestifer groel, was used to develop a colloidal gold immunochromatographic strip. colloidal gold particles were prepared by chemical synthesis to an average diameter of 20 +/- 5.26 nm by transmission electron microscope imaging. mab 1g2f10 was conjugated to colloidal gold particles and the formation of antibody-colloidal gold conjugates was monitored by uv/vis spectroscopy. immunochromatographic strips were assembled in regular sequence through different accessories sticked on pvc plate. strips specifically detected  r. anatipestifer within 10 min, but did not detect e. coli, s. enterica and p. multocida. the detection limit for r. anatipestifer was 1 x 10(6) colony forming  units, which was 500 times higher than a conventional agglutination test. accuracy was 100% match to multiplex pcr. assay stability and reproducibility were excellent after storage at 4 degrees c for 6 months. the immunochromatographic strips prepared in this study offer a specific, sensitive,  and rapid detection method for r. anatipestifer, which is of great importance for the prevention and control of r. anatipestifer infections.

TI  == potential probiotic attributes of a new strain of bacillus coagulans cgmcc 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces.
AB  == a new strain of bacillus coagulans cgmcc 9551, which has a broad range of antibacterial activities against six main pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli o8, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, streptococcus suis, listeria monocytogenes and pasteurella multocida, was isolated from healthy piglet feces. in adhesion assay, the isolate exhibited a stronger adhesion to pig intestinal mucus than that of b. subtilis jt143 and l. acidophilus ly24 respectively isolated from bioplus((r))2b and florafit((r)) probiotics (p < 0.05). the adhesion activity reached 44.5 +/- 3.2,  48.9 +/- 2.6, 42.6 +/- 3.3 and 37.6 +/- 2.4 % to jejunum, ileum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon, separately. the survival rate of b. coagulans cgmcc 9551 was reduced by only 20 % at 4 h exposure under 0.9 % w/v bile salt. the strain was fully resistant to ph 2 for 2 h with 90.1 +/- 3.5 % survival and susceptible to 15 antibiotics commonly used in veterinary medicine. additionally, the bacteria showed amylase, protease and cellulase activities. the safety assessment demonstrated the lack of toxicity potential in b. coagulans cgmcc 9551 by ligated rabbit ileal loop assay, acute and subchronic toxicity test. these results implied that that the new strain of b. coagulans cgmcc 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces has promising probiotic characteristics and offers desirable opportunities for its successful commercialization as one excellent candidate probiotic.

TI  == protectivity conferred by immunization with intranasal recombinant outer membrane protein h from pasteurella multocida serovar a:1 in chickens.
AB  == recombinant outer membrane protein h (romph) is a potential fowl cholera vaccine  candidate. the present study was aimed at developing romph formulations for intranasal administration. the romph was purified and formulated with either escherichia coli enterotoxin b (ltb) or cpg oligodeoxynucleotides (odn) as an adjuvant. antibody responses in chickens intranasally immunized with romph in combination with 2 different adjuvants were significantly increased (p<0.05) post immunization. chicken survival rates showed that romph formulated with odn and ltb elicited 90% and 70% protection, respectively. our findings indicated that romph formulated with odn elicited protection better than that formulated with ltb. therefore, the vaccines formulations in the present study can be considered  new intranasal vaccine formulations for fowl cholera in chickens.

TI  == recombinant transferrin binding protein a (rtbpa) fragments of pasteurella multocida serogroup b:2 provide variable protection following homologous challenge in mouse model.
AB  == transferrin binding protein a (tbpa), an iron acquisition surface protein that also acts as virulence factor, is widely distributed among strains of pasteurella multocida. in the present study, a total of seven clones of tbpa fragments (39d to f777; 39d to q697; 188v to f777; 188v to q697; 39d to p377; 188v to p377 and 39d to f187) belonging to p. multocida b:2 were constructed, over-expressed and purified as recombinant fusion proteins from escherichia coli using affinity chromatography. immunization of mice with rtbpa fragments resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) rise in antigen specific serum total igg and subtypes (igg1 and igg2a) tires. all immunized mice challenged with 8 ld50 of p. multocida b:2 resulted in a variable protective efficacy up to 50%. the study indicated the potential possibilities to incorporate full length tbpa in subunit vaccine formulation composed of synergistic subunit antigens against haemorrhagic septicaemia (hs) in cattle and buffalo.

TI  == deletion of the znua virulence factor attenuates actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae  and confers protection against homologous or heterologous strain challenge.
AB  == the znua gene is known to be important for growth and survival in escherichia coli, haemophilus spp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, and pasteurella multocida under low zn(2+) conditions. this gene is also present in actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 1; therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate  the existence of a similar role for the znua gene in the growth and virulence of  this organism. a precisely defined deltaznua deletion mutant of a. pleuropneumoniae was constructed based on the sequence of the wild-type slw01 using transconjugation and counterselection. this mutation was found to be lethal in low-zn(2+) medium. furthermore, the deltaznua mutant strain exhibited attenuated virulence (>/=22-fold) as well as reduced mortality and morbidity in a murine (balb/c) model of infection. the majority of the bacteria were cleared from the lungs within 2 weeks. the deltaznua mutant strain caused no adverse effects in pigs at doses of up to 1.0x10(9) cfu/ml. the deltaznua mutant strain induced a significant immune response and conferred 80% and 100% protection on immunised pigs against challenge with a. pleuropneumoniae strains belonging to homologous or heterologous serovars, respectively, compared to the blank controls. the data obtained in this study indicate the potential of the mutant deltaznua strain for development as a live vaccine capable of inducing reliable cross-serovar protection following intratracheal immunisation.

TI  == growth of mannheimia haemolytica: inhibitory agents and putative mechanism of inhibition.
AB  == leukotoxin-producing mannheimia haemolytica consistently causes fatal pneumonia in bighorn sheep (bhs) under experimental conditions. surprisingly, by culture methods, it has been isolated from pneumonic bhs lungs less frequently than other bacteria. however, in one study pcr assays detected m. haemolytica from over 70%  of the pneumonic lung samples that were negative for this organism by culture, suggesting that the growth of m. haemolytica is inhibited by other bacteria. previously, we have shown that bibersteinia trehalosi inhibits the growth of m. haemolytica. herein we report that 100% of a diverse panel of b. trehalosi isolates (n=55) tested in a bacterial competition assay inhibited the growth of m. haemolytica, suggesting that the inhibitory phenotype is conserved. further, no plasmids were isolated from any of the 30 b. trehalosi isolates tested, suggesting that the effectors are chromosomally encoded. an earlier study by us showed that pasteurella multocida also inhibits the growth of m. haemolytica. however, m. haemolytica has not been isolated even from pneumonic bhs lungs that  did not carry b. trehalosi or p. multocida. consequently, we tested staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., and escherichia coli, the bacteria that  have been detected frequently in pneumonic bhs lungs, for possible inhibition of  m. haemolytica. neither the staphylococcus spp. nor the streptococcus sp. strains inhibited the growth of m. haemolytica. e. coli inhibited the growth of m. haemolytica by a proximity-dependent mechanism. growth inhibition of m. haemolytica by several bacterial species is likely to contribute to the infrequent detection of this bacterium from pneumonic bhs lungs by culture.

TI  == screening of lactobacillus strains of domestic goose origin against bacterial poultry pathogens for use as probiotics.
AB  == lactobacilli are natural inhabitants of human and animal mucous membranes, including the avian gastrointestinal tract. recently, increasing attention has been given to their probiotic, health-promoting capacities, among which their antagonistic potential against pathogens plays a key role. a study was conducted  to evaluate probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from feces or  cloacae of domestic geese. among the 104 examined isolates, previously identified to the species level by whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and analysis of 16s-23s regions of rdna, dominated lactobacillus salivarius (35%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18%) and lactobacillus ingluviei (11%). all lactobacilli were screened for antimicrobial activity toward salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and riemerella anatipestifer using the agar slab method and the well diffusion method. lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus plantarum exhibited particularly strong antagonism toward all of the indicator strains. in the agar slab method, the highest sensitivity to lactobacillus was observed in r. anatipestifer and p. multocida, and the lowest in e. coli and s. aureus. the ability to produce h(2)o(2)was exhibited by 92% of isolates, but there was no correlation between the rate of production of this reactive oxygen species and the antimicrobial activity of lactobacillus sp. all lactobacilli showed resistance to ph 3.0 and 3.5 and to 2% bile. the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from geese may have probiotic potential in reducing bacterial infections. the antibacterial activity of the selected lactobacilli is  mainly due to lactic acid production by these bacteria. the selected lactobacillus strains that strongly inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria,  and were also resistant to low ph and bile salts, can potentially restore the balance of intestinal microflora in geese and could offer an alternative to antibiotic therapy.

TI  == integron-bearing gram-negative bacteria in lake waters.
AB  == the aim of the study was to determine the occurrence of integron-bearing gram-negative bacteria in the water of four lakes located in wielkopolski national park, poland. altogether, 17 isolates harbouring class 1 or class 2 integrons were found. the integron-bearing bacteria were identified as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pasteurella multocida and aeromonas hydrophila. the variable regions of the class 1 integrons contained aada1 and dfra1-aada1 gene cassettes, whereas class 2 integrons carried dfra1-sat2-aada1 gene cassette array. the isolates were resistant to 3-20 antimicrobials. one of them produced shv-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. significance and impact  of the study: integrons play a major role in the spread of antibiotic resistance  among bacteria. they are frequently found in clinical bacterial strains, but are  also detected in environmental isolates in sites affected by anthropogenic pressure. little is known, however, about the presence and characteristics of integrons in bacteria living in water environments in areas of nature preservation. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study focused on detection and characterization of integrons in bacteria living in water ecosystems in a national park.

TI  == cloning, expression, and purification of a new antimicrobial peptide gene from musca domestica larva.
AB  == musca domestica (diptera: muscidae), the housefly, exhibits unique immune defences and can produce antimicrobial peptides upon stimulation with bacteria. based on the cdna library constructed using the suppression subtractive hybridization (ssh) method, a 198-bp antimicrobial peptide gene, which we named mdap-2, was amplified by rapid amplification of cdna ends (race) from m. domestica larvae stimulated with salmonella pullorum (enterobacteriaceae: salmonella). in the present study, the full-length mdap-2 gene was cloned and inserted into a his-tagged escherichia coli prokaryotic expression system to enable production of the recombinant peptide. the recombinant mdap-2 peptide was  purified using ni-nta histrap ff crude column chromatography. the bacteriostatic  activity of the recombinant purified mdap-2 protein was assessed. the results indicated that mdap-2 had in vitro antibacterial activity against all of the tested gram- bacteria from clinical isolates, including e. coli (enterobacteriaceae: escherichia), one strain of s. pullorum (enterobacteriaceae: salmonella), and one strain of pasteurella multocida. dna sequencing and blast analysis showed that the mdap-2 antimicrobial peptide gene was not homologous to  any other antimicrobial peptide genes in genbank. the antibacterial mechanisms of the newly discovered mdap-2 peptide warrant further study.

TI  == the effect of indomethacin, myeloperoxidase, and certain steroid hormones on bactericidal activity: an ex vivo and in vivo experimental study.
AB  == background: the role of myeloperoxidase (mpo) is essential in the killing of phagocytosed bacteria. certain steroid hormones increase mpo plasma concentration. our aim was to test the effect of mpo, its inhibitor indomethacin, and certain steroid hormones on bactericidal activity. methods: human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) were incubated with opsonised escherichia coli and either mpo, indomethacin, estradiol, or hydrocortisone. intracellular killing capacity was evaluated with uv microscopy after treatment with fluorescent dye. next, an in vivo experiment was performed with nine groups of rats: in the first  phase of the study indomethacin treatment and pasteurella multocida infection (ii), indomethacin treatment without infection (i0), untreated control with infection (mi) and untreated control without infection (m0); in the second phase  of the study rats with infection and testosterone treatment (nt), castration, infection and testosterone treatment (ct), castration, infection and estradiol treatment (ce), non-castrated infected control (n0), and castrated infected control (c0). after treatment bacteria were reisolated from the liver and heart blood on agar plates, and laboratory parameters were analyzed. for the comparison of laboratory results anova or kruskal-wallis test and lsd post hoc test was used. results: indomethacin did not have a remarkable effect on the bacterial killing of pmns, while the other compounds increased bacterial killing to various degrees. in the animal model indomethacin and infection caused a poor clinical state, a great number of reisolated bacteria, elevated white blood cell (wbc) count, decreased c-reactive protein (crp) and serum albumin levels. testosterone  treatment resulted in less bacterial colony numbers in group nt, but not in group ct compared to respective controls (n0, c0). estradiol treatment (ce) decreased colony numbers compared to control (c0). hormone administration resulted in lower wbc counts, and in group ce, a decreased crp. conclusions: mpo, estradiol, and hydrocortisone improve bacterial killing activity of pmns. indomethacin treatment and castration weaken immune responses and clinical state of infected rats, while testosterone and estradiol have a beneficial effect.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida, and streptococcus suis isolates from a diagnostic veterinary laboratory and recommendations for a surveillance system.
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility data on escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida,  and streptococcus suis isolates from ontario swine (january 1998 to october 2010) were acquired from a comprehensive diagnostic veterinary laboratory in ontario, canada. in relation to the possible development of a surveillance system for antimicrobial resistance, data were assessed for ease of management, completeness, consistency, and applicability for temporal and spatial statistical analyses. limited farm location data precluded spatial analyses and missing demographic data limited their use as predictors within multivariable statistical models. changes in the standard panel of antimicrobials used for susceptibility testing reduced the number of antimicrobials available for temporal analyses. data consistency and quality could improve over time in this and similar diagnostic laboratory settings by encouraging complete reporting with sample submission and by modifying database systems to limit free-text data entry. these changes could make more statistical methods available for disease surveillance and cluster detection.

TI  == resistance to selected beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == susceptibility in vitro and trends in resistance to antimicrobials were determined by a dilution micromethod in a group of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica and escherichia coli isolates from clinical cases of cattle and swine diseases in the czech republic from 2007 to 2011. a high susceptibility of pig and cattle respiratory pathogens to antimicrobials was found, with the exception of the moderate prevalence of m. haemolytica resistance to ampicillin. in contrast to respiratory pathogens, low susceptibility of e. coli of pig and cattle isolates to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was noted. regarding resistance trends, an increase in levels of resistance among e. coli isolates to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was identified, but the resistance of respiratory isolates was low, with the exception of m. haemolytica. for the period of 2007-2011, there was a significant and almost continuous increase in sales (compared with population correction unit) of ceftiofur, cefquinome and other beta lactams for pigs. consumption peaked in 2010. in the case of amoxicillin in  combination with clavulanic acid, data showed a significant decrease in sales from 2007 to 2008, followed by a period of fluctuation. in cattle, within the groups of 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins and for the whole group of other  betalactams for the period of 2007-2011, there was a significant and almost continuous increase in sales (compared with population correction unit). consumption peaked in 2010. in the case of ceftiofur, there was a huge increase noted from 2010. in the case of amoxicillin in combination with betalactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) data shows a significant decrease from 2007 to 2008,  followed by a period of fluctuation in sales.

TI  == pathogens of bovine respiratory disease in north american feedlots conferring multidrug resistance via integrative conjugative elements.
AB  == in this study, we determined the prevalence of bovine respiratory disease (brd)-associated viral and bacterial pathogens in cattle and characterized the genetic profiles, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and nature of antimicrobial resistance determinants in collected bacteria. nasopharyngeal swab and lung tissue samples from 68 brd mortalities in alberta, canada (n = 42), texas (n = 6), and nebraska (n = 20) were screened using pcr for bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv), bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, parainfluenza type 3 virus, mycoplasma bovis, mannheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, and histophilus somni. excepting bovine herpesvirus 1, all agents were detected.  m. haemolytica (91%) and bvdv (69%) were the most prevalent, with cooccurrence in 63% of the cattle. isolates of m. haemolytica (n = 55), p. multocida (n = 8), and h. somni (n = 10) from lungs were also collected. among m. haemolytica isolates,  a clonal subpopulation (n = 8) was obtained from a nebraskan feedlot. all three bacterial pathogens exhibited a high rate of antimicrobial resistance, with 45% exhibiting resistance to three or more antimicrobials. m. haemolytica (n = 18), p. multocida (n = 3), and h. somni (n = 3) from texas and nebraska possessed integrative conjugative elements (ice) that conferred resistance for up to seven  different antimicrobial classes. ice were shown to be transferred via conjugation from p. multocida to escherichia coli and from m. haemolytica and h. somni to p.  multocida. ice-mediated multidrug-resistant profiles of bacterial brd pathogens could be a major detriment to many of the therapeutic antimicrobial strategies currently used to control brd.

TI  == multiple-class antimicrobial resistance surveillance in swine escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis isolates from ontario and the impact of the 2004-2006 porcine circovirus type-2 associated disease outbreak.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe trends in multiple-class antimicrobial resistance present in clinical isolates of escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis from ontario swine 1998-2010. temporal changes in multiple-class resistance varied by the pathogens examined; significant yearly changes were apparent for the e. coli and p. multocida data. although not present in the e. coli data, significant increases in multiple-class resistance within p. multocida isolates occurred from 2003 to 2005, coinciding with the expected increase in antimicrobials used to treat clinical signs of porcine circovirus associated disease (pcvad) before it was confirmed. prospective temporal scan statistics for multiple-class resistance suggest that significant clusters of increased resistance may have been found in the spring of 2004; months before the identification of the pcvad outbreak in the fall of 2004.

TI  == kpsc and kpss are retaining 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (kdo) transferases involved in synthesis of bacterial capsules.
AB  == capsular polysaccharides (cpss) are high-molecular-mass cell-surface polysaccharides, that act as important virulence factors for many pathogenic bacteria. several clinically important gram-negative pathogens share similar systems for cps biosynthesis and export; examples include escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, and pasteurella multocida. each cps contains a serotype-specific repeat-unit structure, but the glycans all possess a lipid moiety at their reducing termini.  in e. coli and n. meningitidis, the predominant lipid is a lysophosphatidylglycerol moiety that is attached to the repeat-unit domain of the cps via multiple residues of 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (kdo), referred  to as a poly-kdo linker. the kdo residues are beta-linked, suggesting that they are synthesized by retaining glycosyltransferases. to date, the only characterized kdo transferases are the inverting enzymes that catalyze the alpha-linkages found in lipopolysaccharide. here, we identify two conserved proteins from cps assembly systems, kpsc and kpss, as the beta-kdo-transferases and demonstrate in vitro reconstitution of poly-kdo linker assembly on a fluorescent phosphatidylglycerol acceptor. kpss adds the first kdo residue, and this reaction product is then extended by kpsc. cross-complementation experiments demonstrate that the e. coli and n. meningitidis protein homologs are functionally conserved.

TI  == immunogenicity of highly conserved recombinant vacj outer membrane lipoprotein of pasteurella multocida.
AB  == bacterial lipoproteins are emerging targets for inducing protective immunity against many infectious diseases. vacj is a highly conserved and widely distributed outer membrane lipoprotein of pasteurella multocida strains, which are known to affect a wide range of domestic as well as wild animals and birds. in the present study, the gene encoding for mature vacj outer membrane lipoprotein of p. multocida serogroup b:2 strain p52 was cloned and over-expressed in escherichia coli as a fusion protein. the purified recombinant  vacj protein ( approximately 44kda) was used for immunizing mice (6/group) along  with adjuvants (fca and alum) in two experiments. immunization of mice with rvacj (30mug and 75mug/mice) elicited humoral immune response with significant (p<0.01) rise in antigen-specific titers of igg and its subtypes (igg1 and igg2a). no protection was noticed in mice immunized with rvacj (30mug) along with fca followed by challenge with 100 ld50 of the homologous strain. on the contrary, higher rvacj dose (75mug) along with fca and alum provided 66.7% and 50% protection respectively, at reduced challenge dose (8 ld50). the study indicated  that a lipidated recombinant vacj lipoprotein with suitable adjuvants could potentially act as candidate antigen for vaccine development against pasteurellosis in livestock.

TI  == structural basis for substrate specificity and mechanism of n-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid lyase from pasteurella multocida.
AB  == n-acetylneuraminate lyases (nals) or sialic acid aldolases catalyze the reversible aldol cleavage of n-acetylneuraminic acid (neu5ac, the most common form of sialic acid) to form pyruvate and n-acetyl-d-mannosamine. although equilibrium favors sialic acid cleavage, these enzymes can be used for high-yield chemoenzymatic synthesis of structurally diverse sialic acids in the presence of  excess pyruvate. engineering these enzymes to synthesize structurally modified natural sialic acids and their non-natural derivatives holds promise in creating  novel therapeutic agents. atomic-resolution structures of these enzymes will greatly assist in guiding mutagenic and modeling studies to engineer enzymes with altered substrate specificity. we report here the crystal structures of wild-type pasteurella multocida n-acetylneuraminate lyase and its k164a mutant. like other  bacterial lyases, it assembles into a homotetramer with each monomer folding into a classic (beta/alpha)(8) tim barrel. two wild-type structures were determined, in the absence of substrates, and trapped in a schiff base intermediate between lys164 and pyruvate, respectively. three structures of the k164a variant were determined: one in the absence of substrates and two binary complexes with n-acetylneuraminic acid (neu5ac) and n-glycolylneuraminic acid (neu5gc). both sialic acids bind to the active site in the open-chain ketone form of the monosaccharide. the structures reveal that every hydroxyl group of the linear sugars makes hydrogen bond interactions with the enzyme, and the residues that determine specificity were identified. additionally, the structures provide some  clues for explaining the natural discrimination of sialic acid substrates between the p. multocida and escherichia coli nals.

TI  == structural analysis and cross-protective efficacy of recombinant 87 kda outer membrane protein (omp87) of pasteurella multocida serogroup b:2.
AB  == pasteurella multocida serogroup b:2, a causative agent of haemorrhagic septicaemia (hs) in cattle and buffalo especially in tropical regions of asian and african countries, is known to possess several outer membrane proteins (omps) as immunogenic antigens. in the present study, omp87 gene encoding for 87 kda omp (omp87) protein of p. multocida serogroup b:2 strain p52, has been amplified ( approximately 2304 bp), cloned in to pet32a vector and over-expressed in recombinant escherichia coli as fusion protein. the recombinant omp87 protein ( approximately 102 kda) including n-terminus hexa-histidine tag was purified under denaturing condition. immunization of mice with romp87 resulted in increased antigen specific igg titres in serum and provided protection of 66.6 and 83.3% following homologous (b:2) and heterologous (a:1) challenge, respectively. a homology model of omp87 revealed the presence of two distinct domains; n-terminal domain with four potra repeats in the periplasmic space and a pore forming c-terminal beta-barrel domain (beta1- beta16) in the outer membrane of p. multocida, which belong to omp85-tpsb transporter superfamily of omps. the study  indicated the potential possibilities to use romp87 protein along with suitable adjuvant in developing subunit vaccine for haemorrhagic septicaemia and pasteurellosis in livestock.

TI  == determinants of ph-dependent modulation of translocation in dermonecrotic g-protein-deamidating toxins.
AB  == cytotoxic necrotizing factors from e. coli (cnf1, cnf2) and yersinia (cnfy)share  n-terminal sequence similarity with pasteurella multocida toxin (pmt). this common n-terminal region harbors the receptor-binding and translocation domains that mediate uptake and delivery of the c-terminal catalytic cargo domains into the host cytosol. subtle variations in the n-terminal ~500 amino acids of cnfs and pmt could allow for selective recognition of cellular receptors and thus, selective target cell specificity. through studies with cellular inhibitors, we have identified an additional novel function for this region in modulating responses of these toxin proteins to changes in ph during intoxication and delivery of the catalytic cargo domain into the cytosol.

AB  == macrolides are the first-line treatment against bovine respiratory disease (brd), and are also used to treat infections in humans. the macrolide, tylosin phosphate, is often included in the diet of cattle as a preventative for liver abscesses in many regions of the world outside of europe. this study investigated the effects of administering macrolides to beef cattle either systemically through a single subcutaneous injection (therapeutic) or continuously in-feed (subtherapeutic), on the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of mannheimia haemolytica and enterococcus spp. isolated from the nasopharynx and faeces, respectively. nasopharyngeal and faecal samples were collected weekly over 28 days from untreated beef steers and from steers injected once with tilmicosin or  tulathromycin or continuously fed tylosin phosphate at dosages recommended by manufacturers. tilmicosin and tulathromycin were effective in lowering (p < 0.05) the prevalence of m. haemolytica, whereas subtherapeutic tylosin had no effect. m. haemolytica isolated from control- and macrolide-treated animals were susceptible to macrolides as well as to other antibiotics. major bacteria co-isolated with m. haemolytica from the nasopharynx included pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus spp., acinetobacter spp., escherichia coli and bacillus spp. with the exception of m. haemolytica and p. multocida, erythromycin resistance was frequently found in other isolated species. both methods of macrolide administration increased (p < 0.05) the proportion of erythromycin resistant enterococci within the population, which was comprised almost exclusively of enterococcus hirae. injectable macrolides impacted both respiratory and enteric microbes, whereas orally administered macrolides only influenced enteric bacteria.

TI  == characterization of a trifunctional glucosyltransferase essential for moraxella catarrhalis lipooligosaccharide assembly.
AB  == the human respiratory tract pathogen moraxella catarrhalis expresses lipooligosaccharides (los), glycolipid surface moieties that are associated with  enhanced colonization and virulence. recent studies have delineated the major steps required for the biosynthesis and assembly of the m. catarrhalis los molecule. we previously demonstrated that the glucosyltransferase enzyme lgt3 is  responsible for the addition of at least one glucose (glc) molecule, at the beta-(1-4) position, to the inner core of the los molecule. our data further suggested a potential multifunctional role for lgt3 in los biosynthesis. the studies reported here demonstrate that the lgt3 enzyme possesses two glycosyltransferase domains (a1 and a2) similar to that of other bifunctional glycosyltransferase enzymes involved in surface polysaccharide biosynthesis in escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus pyogenes. each lgt3 domain contains a conserved dxd motif, shown to be involved in the catalytic activity of other glycosyltransferases. to determine the function of each domain, a1 (n-terminal), a2 (c-terminal) and double a1a2 site-directed dad to aaa mutants were constructed and the resulting los phenotypes of these modified strains were  analyzed. our studies indicate that the lgt3 n-terminal a1 catalytic domain is responsible for the addition of the first beta-(1-3) glc to the first glc on the  inner core. the c-terminal catalytic domain a2 then adds the beta-(1-4) glc and the beta-(1-6) glc, confirming the bifunctional nature of this domain. the results from these experiments demonstrate that lgt3 is a novel, multifunctional  transferase responsible for the addition of three glcs with differing linkages onto the inner core of m. catarrhalis los.

TI  == donor substrate promiscuity of the n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activities of  pasteurella multocida heparosan synthase 2 (pmhs2) and escherichia coli k5 kfia.
AB  == the biological activities of heparan sulfate (hs) and heparin (hp) are closely related to their molecular structures. both pasteurella multocida heparosan synthase 2 (pmhs2) and escherichia coli k5 kfia have been used for enzymatic and  chemoenzymatic synthesis of hs and hp oligosaccharides and their derivatives. we  show here that cloning using the pet15b vector and expressing pmhs2 as an n-his6-tagged fusion protein improve its expression level in e. coli. investigation of the donor substrate specificity of the n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activities of p. multocida heparosan synthase 2 (pmhs2) and e. coli k5 kfia indicates the substrate promiscuities of pmhs2 and kfia. overall, both pmhs2 and kfia can use uridine 5'-diphosphate-n-acetylglucosamine (udp-glcnac) and some of its c2'- and c6'-derivatives as donor substrates for their alpha1-4-glcnact activities. nevertheless, pmhs2 has a broader tolerance towards substrate modifications. other than the udp-sugars that can be used by kfia, additional c6'-derivatives of udp-glcnac, udp-glucose, and udp-n-acetylgalactosamine (udp-galnac) are tolerable substrates for the alpha1-4-glcnact activity of pmhs2. the substrate promiscuities of pmhs2 and kfia will allow efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of  diverse hs and hp oligosaccharide derivatives which may have improved or altered  activities compared to their natural counterparts.

TI  == conserved glycolipid termini in capsular polysaccharides synthesized by atp-binding cassette transporter-dependent pathways in gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == bacterial capsules are surface layers made of long-chain polysaccharides. they are anchored to the outer membrane of many gram-negative bacteria, including pathogens such as escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, and pasteurella multocida. capsules protect pathogens from host defenses including complement-mediated killing and phagocytosis and therefore represent a major virulence factor. capsular polysaccharides are synthesized by enzymes located in the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane and are then translocated to  the cell surface. whereas the enzymes that synthesize the polysaccharides have been studied in detail, the structure and biosynthesis of the anchoring elements  have not been definitively resolved. here we determine the structure of the glycolipid attached to the reducing terminus of the polysialic acid capsular polysaccharides from e. coli k1 and n. meningitidis group b and the heparosan-like capsular polysaccharide from e. coli k5. all possess the same unique glycolipid terminus consisting of a lyso-phosphatidylglycerol moiety with  a beta-linked poly-(3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid) (poly-kdo) linker attached to the reducing terminus of the capsular polysaccharide.

TI  == demonstration of ornithobacterium rhinotracheale in pheasants (phasianus colchicus) with pneumonia and airsacculitis.
AB  == outbreaks of respiratory disease were investigated in reared pheasants (phasianus colchicus) aged approximately 18 to 32 weeks, released into the semi-wild on four shooting estates in southern england. the clinical signs in the affected birds included swelling of the face and eyes, loss of condition, gasping respirations and coughing. the gross pathology findings included sinusitis, airsacculitis, pleural oedema and lung lesions. the histopathological findings in the affected lungs were characterized by a granulomatous pneumonia. ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ort) was isolated from respiratory tract tissues, and 16s rrna gene sequencing on three isolates revealed two distinct genotypes, one previously associated with some electrophoretic type (et) 1 strains and the other a novel genotype that clustered among sequences previously associated with et 3, et 4, et 5 and et 6 isolates. the localization of ort within the lung tissue was demonstrated by fluorescent in-situ hybridization in the bronchial exudate of three cases, although not within the granulomatous lesions themselves. in each case, ort was identified as part of a complex of other respiratory agents including avian paramyxovirus type 2, avian coronavirus, mycoplasma gallisepticum, mycoplasma synoviae and other mycoplasma species, escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, other pasteurellaceae and syngamus trachea, suggesting synergism with other agents. exposure to other intercurrent factors, including adverse weather conditions and internal parasitism, may also have exacerbated the severity of disease.

TI  == development and application of a multiplex pcr assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB  == infections with pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, riemerella anatipestifer, and escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. it can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks.  the aim of this study was to develop a multiplex pcr (mpcr) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single  tube reaction. the target genes used were kmt1 of p. multocida, the invasion protein gene of s. enterica, 16s rdna of r. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of e. coli. the detection limit of the assay for all bacterial dna was 10 pg. the mpcr did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, mycoplasma gallinarum, mycoplasma synoviae, and mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. we applied mpcr to field samples, and the results were the same as the single pcr results. these results suggest that mpcr for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.

TI  == one-pot multi-enzyme (opme) chemoenzymatic synthesis of sialyl-tn-muc1 and sialyl-t-muc1 glycopeptides containing natural or non-natural sialic acid.
AB  == a series of stn-muc1 and st-muc1 glycopeptides containing naturally occurring and non-natural sialic acids have been chemoenzymatically synthesized from tn-muc1 glycopeptide using one-pot multienzyme (opme) approaches. in situ generation of the sialyltransferase donor cytidine 5'-monophosphate-sialic acid (cmp-sia) using a cmp-sialic acid synthetase in the presence of an extra amount of cytidine 5'-triphosphate (ctp) and removal of cmp from the reaction mixture by flash c18 cartridge purification allow the complete consumption of tn-muc1 glycopeptide for quantitative synthesis of stn-muc1. a campylobacter jejuni beta1-3galt (cjcgtbdelta30-his6) mutant has been found to catalyze the transfer of one or more galactose residues to tn-muc1 for the synthesis of t-muc1 and galactosylated t-muc1. sialylation of t-muc1 using pasteurella multocida alpha2-3-sialyltransferase 3 (pmst3) with neisseria meningitidis cmp-sialic acid  synthetase (nmcss) and escherichia coli sialic acid aldolase in one pot produced  st-muc1 efficiently. these glycopeptides are potential cancer vaccine candidates.

TI  == production methods for heparosan, a precursor of heparin and heparan sulfate.
AB  == heparin and heparan sulfate belong to the glycosaminoglycan family. heparin which is known as a powerful anticoagulant has been also described to have potential in therapeutic applications such as in the treatment against cancer and prevention of virus infections. heparan sulfate, an analog of heparin, which is not used for medical purposes yet, was reported to have the same pharmaceutical potential as heparin. both heparin and heparan sulfate share a common precursor molecule known as heparosan. heparosan determines the polymer chain length and the sugar unit backbone composition, which are determinant structural parameters for the biological activity of heparin and heparan sulfate. in this review we give an overview of the different methods used to synthesize heparosan, and we highlight  the pro and cons of each method in respect to the synthesis of bioengineered heparin-like molecules. advancements in the field of the synthesis of bioengineered heparin are also reported.

TI  == bactericidal activity of tracheal antimicrobial peptide against respiratory pathogens of cattle.
AB  == tracheal antimicrobial peptide (tap) is a beta-defensin produced by mucosal epithelial cells of cattle. although effective against several human pathogens, the activity of this bovine peptide against the bacterial pathogens that cause bovine respiratory disease have not been reported. this study compared the antibacterial effects of synthetic tap against mannheimia haemolytica, histophilus somni, pasteurella multocida, and mycoplasma bovis. bactericidal activity against m. bovis was not detected. in contrast, the pasteurellaceae bacteria showed similar levels of susceptibility to that of escherichia coli, with 0.125mug tap inhibiting growth in a radial diffusion assay and minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1.56-6.25mug/ml in a bactericidal assay. significant differences among isolates were not observed. sequencing of exon 2 of the tap gene from 23 cattle revealed a prevalent non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) a137g, encoding either serine or asparagine at residue 20 of the mature peptide. the functional effect of this snp was tested against m. haemolytica using synthetic peptides. the bactericidal effect of the asparagine-containing peptide was consistently higher than the serine-containing  peptide. bactericidal activities were similar for an acapsular mutant of m. haemolytica compared to the wild type. these findings indicate that the pasteurellaceae bacteria that cause bovine respiratory disease are susceptible to killing by bovine tap and appear not to have evolved resistance, whereas m. bovis appears to be resistant. a non-synonymous snp was identified in the coding region of the tap gene, and the corresponding peptides vary in their bactericidal activity against m. haemolytica.

TI  == the ompa family of proteins: roles in bacterial pathogenesis and immunity.
AB  == the ompa family of outer membrane proteins is a group of genetically related, heat-modifiable, surface-exposed, porin proteins that are in high-copy number in  the outer membrane of mainly gram-negative bacteria. ompa proteins are characterized by an n-terminal domain that forms an eight-stranded, anti-parallel beta barrel, which is embedded in the outer membrane. the c-terminal domain is globular and located in the periplasmic space. escherichia coli ompa is the best  characterized of the proteins. other well-characterized ompa-equivalent proteins  from pathogenic bacteria include pseudomonas aeruginosa oprf, haemophilus influenzae p5, klebsiella pneumoniae ompa, and chlamydia trachomatis major outer  membrane protein (momp). ompa from the veterinary pathogens mannheimia haemolytica, haemophilus parasuis, leptospira interrogans, and pasteurella multocida have been studied to a lesser extent. among many of the pathogenic bacteria, ompa proteins have important pathogenic roles including bacterial adhesion, invasion, or intracellular survival as well as evasion of host defenses or stimulators of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. these pathogenic roles are most commonly associated with central nervous system, respiratory and urogenital diseases. alternatively, ompa family proteins can serve as targets of  the immune system with immunogenicity related to surface-exposed loops of the molecule. in several cases, ompa proteins are under evaluation as potential vaccine candidates.

TI  == rho/rock-dependent inhibition of 3t3-l1 adipogenesis by g-protein-deamidating dermonecrotic toxins: differential regulation of notch1, pref1/dlk1, and beta-catenin signaling.
AB  == the dermonecrotic toxins from pasteurella multocida (pmt), bordetella (dnt), escherichia coli (cnf1-3), and yersinia (cnfy) modulate their g-protein targets through deamidation and/or transglutamination of an active site gln residue, which results in activation of the g protein and its cognate downstream signaling pathways. whereas dnt and the cnfs act on small rho gtpases, pmt acts on the alpha subunit of heterotrimeric g(q), g(i), and g(12/13) proteins. we previously  demonstrated that pmt potently blocks adipogenesis and adipocyte differentiation  in a calcineurin-independent manner through downregulation of notch1 and stabilization of beta-catenin and pref1/dlk1, key proteins in signaling pathways  strongly linked to cell fate decisions, including fat and bone development. here, we report that similar to pmt, dnt, and cnf1 completely block adipogenesis and adipocyte differentiation by preventing upregulation of adipocyte markers, ppargamma and c/ebpalpha, while stabilizing the expression of pref1/dlk1 and beta-catenin. we show that the rho/rock inhibitor y-27632 prevented or reversed these toxin-mediated effects, strongly supporting a role for rho/rock signaling in dermonecrotic toxin-mediated inhibition of adipogenesis and adipocyte differentiation. toxin treatment was also accompanied by downregulation of notch1 expression, although this inhibition was independent of rho/rock signaling. we further show that pmt-mediated downregulation of notch1 expression occurs primarily through g(12/13) signaling. our results reveal new details of the pathways involved in dermonecrotic toxin action on adipocyte differentiation, and the role of rho/rock signaling in mediating toxin effects on wnt/beta-catenin and notch1 signaling, and in particular the role of g(q) and g(12/13) in mediating pmt effects on rho/rock and notch1 signaling.

AB  == pasteurella multocida serogroup d, producing p. multocida toxin (pmt), is a causative pathogen of progressive atrophic rhinitis (par) in swine. to evaluate the protective immunity and vaccination efficacy of the truncated form of pmt, a  c-terminal form of recombinant pmt (designated pmt2.3; amino acid residues 505 to 1285 of pmt) was expressed in an escherichia coli expression system, and the humoral and cellular immune responses to pmt2.3 were investigated. pmt2.3 vaccination in mice led to high levels of the anti-pmt antibody with a high neutralizing antibody titer. pmt2.3 also induced a cellular immune response to pmt, as demonstrated by the lymphocyte proliferation assay. furthermore, strong protection against a homologous challenge with p. multocida was also observed in  mice vaccinated with pmt2.3. in pmt2.3 vaccination in swine, high levels of serum antibody titers were observed in offspring from sows vaccinated with pmt2.3. offspring from sows vaccinated with pmt2.3 or toxoid showed a good growth performance as depicted by mean body weight at the time of sacrifice, as well as  in average daily gain in the postweaning period. low levels of pathological lesions in turbinate atrophy and pneumonia were also observed in these offspring. therefore, we consider pmt2.3--in the truncated and nontoxic recombinant pmt form--to be an attractive candidate for a subunit vaccine against par induced by  p. multocida infection.

TI  == proteobacterial arfa peptides are synthesized from non-stop messenger rnas.
AB  == the translation of non-stop mrna (which lack in-frame stop codons) represents a significant quality control problem for all organisms. in eubacteria, the transfer-messenger rna (tmrna) system facilitates recycling of stalled ribosomes  from non-stop mrna in a process termed trans-translation or ribosome rescue. during rescue, the nascent chain is tagged with the tmrna-encoded ssra peptide, which promotes polypeptide degradation after release from the stalled ribosome. escherichia coli possesses an additional ribosome rescue pathway mediated by the  arfa peptide. the e. coli arfa message contains a hairpin structure that is cleaved by rnase iii to produce a non-stop transcript. therefore, arfa levels are controlled by tmrna through ssra-peptide tagging and proteolysis. here, we examine whether arfa homologues from other bacteria are also regulated by rnase iii and tmrna. we searched 431 arfa coding sequences for mrna secondary structures and found that 82.8% of the transcripts contain predicted hairpins in  their 3'-coding regions. the arfa hairpins from haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis, vibrio fischeri, and pasteurella multocida are all cleaved by rnase iii as predicted, whereas the hairpin from neisseria gonorrhoeae functions as an  intrinsic transcription terminator to generate non-stop mrna. each arfa homologue is ssra-tagged and degraded when expressed in wild-type e. coli cells, but accumulates in mutants lacking tmrna. together, these findings show that arfa synthesis from non-stop mrna is a conserved mechanism to regulate the alternative ribosome rescue pathway. this strategy ensures that arfa homologues are only deployed when the tmrna system is incapacitated or overwhelmed by stalled ribosomes.

TI  == bactericidal properties of pradofloxacin against veterinary pathogens.
AB  == pradofloxacin is a new veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone developed for use against bacterial infections in dogs and cats involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the minimal bactericidal concentrations have been determined  against clinical isolates of staphylococcus pseudintermedius, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, streptococcus canis, proteus spp., fusobacterium spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella species. a subset of these species was selected, and the in vitro rate of kill by pradofloxacin was determined. for 27 of the 30 tested aerobic strains the pradofloxacin mbc was within two doubling dilutions of the mic. for the remaining strains, the mic and mbc were within three to four doubling dilutions. pradofloxacin also demonstrated bactericidal activity against all anaerobic strains, and the mbc was equal to the mic for four of the strains, within 1 doubling dilution for three strains, within 2 dilutions for a further 3 strains and within 3 dilutions for the remaining five strains. as pradofloxacin concentration was increased, a faster rate of killing was observed; bactericidal  effects were seen in all cases at concentrations </= 0.25 mug/ml. the bactericidal activity against the anaerobic strains was marked, of particular relevance was the complete absence of regrowth even at 48 h at concentrations as  low as 0.125 mug/ml. in conclusion, pradofloxacin exhibits clear bactericidal activity in terms of mbc and kill kinetics against aerobic and anaerobic clinical isolates from dogs and cats at concentrations that are greatly exceeded within the systemic circulation after administration of the recommended therapeutic doses to the target animals. it is expected that such a rapid rate of kill will play a significant role in clinical efficacy. these data demonstrate the complete and rapid killing of anaerobic bacteria by a veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone.

TI  == survey of marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacteria isolated from cattle with respiratory disease and mastitis in europe.
AB  == a monitoring programme conducted in europe since 1994 to survey the marbofloxacin susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle has established the susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated before any antibiotic treatment from bovine mastitis and bovine respiratory disease (brd) cases between 2002 and 2008. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was determined by a standardised microdilution technique. for respiratory pathogens, pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica isolates (751 and 514 strains, respectively) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (mic</=0.03 microg/ml for 77.39 per cent of the strains) and only 1.75 per cent of m haemolytica strains were resistant (mic>/=4  microg/ml). histophilus somni isolates (73 strains) were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (0.008 to 0.06 microg/ml). mycoplasma bovis mic (171 strains) ranged from 0.5 to 4 microg/ml. for mastitis pathogens, the majority of escherichia coli isolates were highly susceptible to marbofloxacin (95.8 per cent of 617 strains). staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (568  and 280 strains) had a homogenous population with mic centred on 0.25 microg/ml.  streptococcus uberis and streptococcus dysgalactiae (660 and 217 strains) were moderately susceptible with mic centred on 1 microg/ml. marbofloxacin mic for these various pathogens appeared stable over the seven years of the monitoring programme and was similar to previously published mic results.

TI  == pmst3 from pasteurella multocida encoded by pm1174 gene is a monofunctional alpha2-3-sialyltransferase.
AB  == pasteurella multocida (pm) strain pm70 has three putative sialyltransferase genes including pm0188, pm0508, and pm1174. a pm0188 gene homolog in pm strain p-1059 encodes a multifunctional alpha2-3-sialyltransferase, pmst1, that prefers oligosaccharide acceptors. a pm0508 gene homolog in the same strain encodes a monofunctional sialyltransferase pmst2 that prefers glycolipid acceptors. here, we report that the third sialyltransferase from pm (pmst3) encoded by gene pm1174 in strain pm70 is a monofunctional alpha2-3-sialyltransferase that can use both oligosaccharides and glycolipids as efficient acceptors. despite the existence of both pm0188 and pm0508 gene homologs encoding pmst1 and pmst2, respectively, in pm strain p-1059, a pm1174 gene homolog appears to be absent from pm strains p-1059 and p-934. pmst3 was successfully obtained by cloning and expression using a synthetic gene of pm1174 with codons optimized for escherichia coli expression  system as the dna template for polymer chain reactions. truncation of 35 amino acid residues from the carboxyl terminus was shown to improve the expression of a soluble and active enzyme in e. coli as a c-his(6)-tagged fusion protein. this sialidase-free monofunctional alpha2-3-sialyltransferase is a useful tool for synthesizing sialylated oligosaccharides and glycolipids.

TI  == plasmid-mediated florfenicol resistance in mannheimia haemolytica isolated from cattle.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse a florfenicol-resistant mannheimia haemolytica isolated from a calf to determine the genetic basis of its florfenicol-resistance. the antimicrobial susceptibility and plasmid content of the isolate were determined. a florfenicol resistant plasmid carrying the flor gene was identified by pcr and transformed into escherichia coli jm109 and hb101  strains. the plasmid was then mapped and sequenced completely. the isolate was resistant to chloramphenicol, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, kanamycin, dihydrostreptomycin, nalidixic acid, ampicillin, and amoxicillin; it carried a flor plasmid of 7.7kb, designated pmh1405. the mobilisation and replication genes of pmh1405 showed extensive similarity to the 5.1-kb pdn1 plasmid from dichelobacter nodosus and the 10.8-kb pcck381 plasmid from pasteurella multocida. an adjacent 2.4-kb segment was highly homologous to the tnflor region of the e. coli bn10660 plasmid. a plasmid-mediated flor gene was responsible for florfenicol resistance in the bovine respiratory tract pathogen m. haemolytica. the pmh1405 plasmid is the smallest flor-carrying plasmid reported to date. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a florfenicol-resistant gene in m. haemolytica.

AB  == background: integrative and conjugative elements (ices) have not been detected in pasteurella multocida. in this study the multiresistance icepmu1 from bovine p. multocida was analysed for its core genes and its ability to conjugatively transfer into strains of the same and different genera. methods: icepmu1 was identified during whole genome sequencing. coding sequences were predicted by bioinformatic tools and manually curated using the annotation software ergo. conjugation into p. multocida, mannheimia haemolytica and escherichia coli recipients was performed by mating assays. the presence of icepmu1 and its circular intermediate in the recipient strains was confirmed by pcr and sequence  analysis. integration sites were sequenced. susceptibility testing of the icepmu1-carrying recipients was conducted by broth microdilution. results: the 82 214 bp icepmu1 harbours 88 genes. the core genes of icepmu1, which are involved in excision/integration and conjugative transfer, resemble those found in a 66 641 bp ice from histophilus somni. icepmu1 integrates into a trna(leu) and is flanked by 13 bp direct repeats. it is able to conjugatively transfer to p. multocida, m. haemolytica and e. coli, where it also uses a trna(leu) for integration and produces closely related 13 bp direct repeats. pcr assays and susceptibility testing confirmed the presence and the functional activity of the  icepmu1-associated resistance genes in the recipient strains. conclusions: the observation that the multiresistance icepmu1 is present in a bovine p. multocida  and can easily spread across strain and genus boundaries underlines the risk of a rapid dissemination of multiple resistance genes, which will distinctly decrease  the therapeutic options.

TI  == the development of a rapid sybr green i-based quantitative pcr for detection of duck circovirus.
AB  == this report describes a one-step real-time polymerase chain reaction assay based  on sybr green i for detection of a broad range of duck circovirus (ducv). align with all ducv complete genome sequences and other genus circovirus download from  the genbank (such as goose circovirus, pigeon circovirus), the primers targets to the replicate gene of ducv were designed. the detection assay was linear in the range of 1.31 x 102-1.31 x 107 copies/mul. the reaction efficiency of the assay using the slope (the slope was -3.349) and the y-intercept was 37.01 from the linear equation was estimated to be 0.99 and the correlation coefficient (r2) was 0.993. a series of experiments were carried out to assess the reproducibility, sensitivity, and specificity of the assay, following by the low intra-assay and inter-assay cvs for ct values obtained with the standard plasmids. the intra-assay cvs were equal or less than 1.89% and the inter-assay cvs were equal  or less than 1.26%. there was no cross-reaction occurred with nucleic acids extracted from ra (riemerella anatipestifer), e. coli (escherichia coli), duck cholera (pasteurella multocida), avian influenza virus, avian paramyxovirus, muscovy duck parvovirus, duck reovirus, duck hepatitis a virus as control templates. the nucleic acids extracted from samples of healthy ducks were used as negative controls. the assay was specific and reproducible. the established real  time pcr was used to detect 45 ducv-negative samples, which were tested using conventional pcr under the developed optimal conditions, each 15 for embryonated  eggs, non-embryonated budgerigar eggs, newly hatched duck, the mixture of the lung, liver, spleen which were analysis for the presence of ducv dna, to conform  that whether the ducv can be transmitted vertically. meanwhile, no positive result was shown by the real-time pcr method. the sybr green i-based quantitative pcr can therefore be practically used as an alternative diagnostic tool and a screening method for ducks infected with duck circovirus.

TI  == combinations of macrolide resistance determinants in field isolates of mannheimia haemolytica and pasteurella multocida.
AB  == respiratory tract infections in cattle are commonly associated with the bacterial pathogens mannheimia haemolytica and pasteurella multocida. these infections can  generally be successfully treated in the field with one of several groups of antibiotics, including macrolides. a few recent isolates of these species exhibit resistance to veterinary macrolides with phenotypes that fall into three distinct classes. the first class has type i macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b antibiotic resistance and, consistent with this, the 23s rrna nucleotide a2058 is monomethylated by the enzyme product of the erm(42) gene. the second class shows  no lincosamide resistance and lacks erm(42) and concomitant 23s rrna methylation. sequencing of the genome of a representative strain from this class, p. multocida 3361, revealed macrolide efflux and phosphotransferase genes [respectively termed msr(e) and mph(e)] that are arranged in tandem and presumably expressed from the  same promoter. the third class exhibits the most marked drug phenotype, with high resistance to all of the macrolides tested, and possesses all three resistance determinants. the combinations of erm(42), msr(e), and mph(e) are chromosomally encoded and intermingled with other exogenous genes, many of which appear to have been transferred from other members of the pasteurellaceae. the presence of some  of the exogenous genes explains recent reports of resistance to additional drug classes. we have expressed recombinant versions of the erm(42), msr(e), and mph(e) genes within an isogenic escherichia coli background to assess their individually contributions to resistance. our findings indicate what types of compounds might have driven the selection for these resistance determinants.

TI  == cellular and molecular action of the mitogenic protein-deamidating toxin from pasteurella multocida.
AB  == the mitogenic toxin from pasteurella multocida (pmt) is a member of the dermonecrotic toxin family, which includes toxins from bordetella, escherichia coli and yersinia. members of the dermonecrotic toxin family modulate g-protein targets in host cells through selective deamidation and/or transglutamination of  a critical active site gln residue in the g-protein target, which results in the  activation of intrinsic gtpase activity. structural and biochemical data point to the uniqueness of pmt among these toxins in its structure and action. whereas the other dermonecrotic toxins act on small rho gtpases, pmt acts on the alpha subunits of heterotrimeric g(q) -, g(i) - and g(12/13) -protein families. to date, experimental evidence supports a model in which pmt potently stimulates various mitogenic and survival pathways through the activation of g(q) and g(12/13) signaling, ultimately leading to cellular proliferation, whilst strongly inhibiting pathways involved in cellular differentiation through the activation of g(i) signaling. the resulting cellular outcomes account for the global physiological effects observed during infection with toxinogenic p. multocida, and hint at potential long-term sequelae that may result from pmt exposure.

TI  == pmst2: a novel pasteurella multocida glycolipid alpha2-3-sialyltransferase.
AB  == pasteurella multocida (pm) is a multi-species pathogen that causes diseases in animals and humans. sialyltransferase activity has been detected in multiple pm strains and sialylation has been shown to be important for the pathogenesis of pm. three putative sialyltransferase genes have been identified in pm genomic strain pm70. we have reported previously that a pm0188 gene homolog in pm strain  p-1059 (atcc 15742) encodes a multifunctional sialyltransferase (pmst1). we demonstrate here that while pmst1 prefers to use oligosaccharides as acceptors, pmst2 encoded by the pm0508 gene homolog in the same pm strain is a novel glycolipid alpha2-3-sialyltransferase that prefers to use lactosyl lipids as acceptor substrates. pmst2 and pmst1 thus complement each other for an efficient  synthesis of alpha2-3-linked sialosides with or without lipid portion. in addition, beta1-4-linked galactosyl lipids are better pmst2 substrates than beta1-3-linked galactosyl lipids. pmst2 has been used successfully in the preparative scale synthesis of sialyllactosyl sphingosine (lyso-gm3), which is an important glycolipid and an intermediate for synthesizing more complex glycolipids such as gangliosides.

TI  == enzymatic placement of 6-o-sulfo groups in heparan sulfate.
AB  == heparan sulfate is a highly sulfated polysaccharide that exhibits important physiological and pathological functions. the glucosamine residue of heparan sulfate can carry sulfo groups at the 2-n, 3-o, and 6-o positions, leading to diverse polysaccharide structures. 6-o-sulfation at the glucosamine residue contributes to a wide range of biological functions. here, we report a method for controlling the positioning of 6-o-sulfo groups in oligosaccharides. this was achieved by synthesizing oligosaccharide backbones from a disaccharide building block utilizing glycosyltransferases followed by modifications using heparan sulfate n-sulfotransferase and 6-o-sulfotransferases. this method offers a viable approach for preparing heparan sulfate oligosaccharides with precisely located 6-o-sulfo groups.

TI  == plasma concentrations resulting from florfenicol preparations given to pigs in their drinking water.
AB  == florfenicol administered through the drinking water has been recommended as a metaphylactic antibacterial drug to control outbreaks of respiratory diseases in  pigs caused by strains of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and pasteurella multocida, yet it is difficult to pinpoint in practice when the drug is given metaphylactically or therapeutically. further, pigs are likely to reject florfenicol-medicated water, and plasma concentrations of the drug are likely to  be marginal for diseases caused by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. the reported minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for these organisms show a breakpoint of 2 to 3 mug/ml. an experiment was conducted during september and october 2009. one hundred twenty healthy crossbred pigs (landrace-yorkshire), weighing 23 +/- 6.2 kg, were used in this trial. they  were randomly assigned to 5 groups, with 3 replicates of 8 animals/group. two commercial preparations of florfenicol were administered through the drinking water at 2 concentrations (0.01 and 0.015%). water intake was measured before and after medication, and plasma concentrations of florfenicol were determined by hplc. considerable rejection of florfenicol-medicated water was observed. however, plasma florfenicol concentrations were of a range sufficient for a methaphylaxis approach to preventing disease by bacteria, with mic breakpoints of </= 0.25 mug/ml. decreased efficacy as a metaphylactic medication should be expected for bacteria with mic >0.25 mug/ml, considering the reported existence of bacteria resistant to florfenicol and the natural resistance of streptococcus  suis or e. coli to this drug.

TI  == a novel erm monomethyltransferase in antibiotic-resistant isolates of mannheimia  haemolytica and pasteurella multocida.
AB  == mannheimia haemolytica and pasteurella multocida are aetiological agents commonly associated with respiratory tract infections in cattle. recent isolates of these  pathogens have been shown to be resistant to macrolides and other ribosome-targeting antibiotics. direct analysis of the 23s rrnas by mass spectrometry revealed that nucleotide a2058 is monomethylated, consistent with a  type i erm phenotype conferring macrolide-lincosamide resistance. the erm resistance determinant was identified by full genome sequencing of isolates. the  sequence of this resistance determinant, now termed erm(42), has diverged greatly from all previously characterized erm genes, explaining why it has remained undetected in pcr screening surveys. the sequence of erm(42) is, however, completely conserved in six independent m. haemolytica and p. multocida isolates, suggesting relatively recent gene transfer between these species. furthermore, the composition of neighbouring chromosomal sequences indicates that erm(42) was  acquired from other members of the pasteurellaceae. expression of recombinant erm(42) in escherichia coli demonstrated that the enzyme retains its properties as a monomethyltransferase without any dimethyltransferase activity. erm(42) is a novel addition to the erm family: it is phylogenetically distant from the other erm family members and it is unique in being a bona fide monomethyltransferase that is disseminated between bacterial pathogens.

AB  == sialyl lewis(x) (sle(x), siaalpha2-3galbeta1-4(fucalpha1-3)glcnacbetaor) is an important sialic acid-containing carbohydrate epitope involved in many biological processes such as inflammation and cancer metastasis. in the biosynthetic process of sle(x), alpha2-3-sialyltransferase-catalyzed sialylation generally proceeds prior to alpha1-3-fucosyltransferase-catalyzed fucosylation. for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of sle(x) containing different sialic acid forms, however, it would be more efficient if diverse sialic acid forms are transferred  in the last step to the fucosylated substrate lewis(x) (le(x)). an alpha2-3-sialyltransferase obtained from myxoma virus-infected european rabbit kidney rk13 cells (viral alpha2-3-sialyltransferase (vst3gal-i)) was reported to  be able to tolerate fucosylated substrate le(x). nevertheless, the substrate specificity of the enzyme was only determined using partially purified protein from extracts of cells infected with myxoma virus. herein we demonstrate that a previously reported multifunctional bacterial enzyme pasteurella multocida sialyltransferase 1 (pmst1) can also use le(x) as an acceptor substrate, although at a much lower efficiency compared to nonfucosylated acceptor. in addition, n-terminal 30-amino-acid truncated vst3gal-i has been successfully cloned and expressed in escherichia coli origami b(de3) cells as a fusion protein with an n-terminal maltose binding protein (mbp) and a c-terminal his(6)-tag (mbp-delta30vst3gal-i-his(6)). the viral protein has been purified to homogeneity and characterized biochemically. the enzyme is active in a broad ph range varying from 5.0 to 9.0. it does not require a divalent metal for its alpha2-3-sialyltransferase activity. it has been used in one-pot multienzyme sialylation of le(x) for the synthesis of sle(x) containing different sialic acid forms with good yields.

TI  == bactericidal activity of porcine neutrophil secretions.
AB  == antimicrobial proteins in neutrophil granules exert their bactericidal activity both within the neutrophil phagolysosome and as components of neutrophil extracellular traps. this study evaluated the bactericidal activity of porcine neutrophil secretions against four bacterial pathogens of swine. porcine neutrophils were treated with or without phorbol myristate acetate (pma), then the resulting supernatants were incubated with escherichia coli k-12, streptococcus suis, actinobacillus suis, or pasteurella multocida, and the surviving colony forming units were enumerated. supernatants of pma-activated neutrophils killed an average of 95% of e. coli k-12 cells, relative to supernatants from untreated neutrophils. inhibition of elastase activity using chloromethylketone (cmk) prior to pma stimulation significantly reduced the bactericidal activity of the neutrophil supernatants; 57% of the pma-induced bactericidal activity against e. coli k-12 was estimated to be elastase-dependent. the same neutrophil supernatants had lower bactericidal activity against s. suis, a. suis, and p. multocida, with 30%, 36% and 13% reduction in bacterial numbers, respectively. the cathelicidin porcine myeloid antimicrobial peptide (pmap)-36 and lactotransferrin were among the proteins identified in the supernatants of pma-stimulated neutrophils by mass spectrometry. these findings imply that elastase-activated proteins, such as cathelicidins, are partially responsible for the bactericidal effect of porcine neutrophil secretions, but non-elastase-dependent proteins such as lactoferrin may also contribute. further, the secretions of activated neutrophils were effective in killing the avirulent e. coli k-12 but were less effective against the other bacteria tested, suggesting that these pathogens may have evolved mechanisms to resist neutrophil-mediated killing.

TI  == recent insights into pasteurella multocida toxin and other g-protein-modulating bacterial toxins.
AB  == over the past few decades, our understanding of the bacterial protein toxins that modulate g proteins has advanced tremendously through extensive biochemical and structural analyses. this article provides an updated survey of the various toxins that target g proteins, ending with a focus on recent mechanistic insights in our understanding of the deamidating toxin family. the dermonecrotic toxin from pasteurella multocida (pmt) was recently added to the list of toxins that disrupt g-protein signal transduction through selective deamidation of their targets. the c3 deamidase domain of pmt has no sequence similarity to the deamidase domains of the dermonecrotic toxins from escherichia coli (cytotoxic necrotizing factor [cnf]1-3), yersinia (cnfy) and bordetella (dermonecrotic toxin). the structure of pmt-c3 belongs to a family of transglutaminase-like proteins, with active site cys-his-asp catalytic triads distinct from e. coli cnf1.

AB  == outer membrane proteins of pasteurella (p.) multocida have been known to be protective immunogens. pasteurella lipoprotein e (plpe) has been reported to be an important cross reactive outer membrane protein in p. multocida. the gene encoding the plpe of p. multocida serotypes a: 3, b: 2 and d: 1 was amplified from the genomic dna. the amplified products were cloned and the nucleotide sequence was determined. sequence analysis of the recombinant clones revealed a single open reading frame of 1,011 bp, 1,008 bp and 1,017 bp encoding a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 37.829 kda, 37.389 kda and 37.965 kda for serotypes a: 3, b: 2 and d: 1 respectively. the comparison of the plpe sequence in different capsular types revealed a high degree (> 90%) of homology. furthermore, the plpe gene of haemorhhagic septicaemia causing serotype (b: 2) was expressed in e. coli and recombinant plpe was strongly immunostained by antiserum against whole cell antigen, indicating that the protein is expressed in vivo.

TI  == microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  == the tonsils of mammals such as humans and pigs are colonized with an extensive microbiota and are frequently the site for asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens. the goal of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial community of the tonsils in healthy pigs. tonsils were collected from eight pigs from two different healthy herds. samples of the tonsils from each pig were used for culture dependent and culture independent identification of the microbial community. aerobic cultivation identified pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus suis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and escherichia coli from >/= 50% of the pigs in both herds. for culture independent studies, microbial community members were identified by 16s rrna sequences using the ribosomal database project pipeline programs developed at michigan state university. dominant genera identified by 16s rrna analysis in pigs from both herds included actinobacillus,  haemophilus, pasteurella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and prevotella. these genera were detected in nearly every pig regardless of herd. in contrast, there was an asymmetric distribution of minor genera between the two herds, suggesting herd-specific differences in the microbial communities. in addition, we demonstrated primer bias between two frequently used forward primers when targeting the tonsillar community. our results suggest that the major bacterial community members found in porcine tonsils are the same regardless of herd, while the minor species are unique to each herd. this is the first analysis using 16s rrna sequence libraries of the composition of microbial communities in  the porcine upper respiratory tract.

AB  == in the pasteurella multocida genome only one putative deoxyribonucleoside kinase  encoding gene, for thymidine kinase 1 (pmtk1), was identified. the pmtk1 gene was sub-cloned into escherichia coli ky895 and it sensitized the host towards 2',2'-difluoro-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine, dfdc), 3'-azido-thymidine (azt) and 5-fluoro-deoxyuridine (5f-du). pmtk1 was over-expressed and purified with two different tags. apparently, deoxyuridine (du), and not thymidine (dt), is the preferred substrate. we suggest that pmtk1s could be employed as a species-specific activator of uracil-based nucleoside antibiotics.

TI  == characterization of the membrane-targeting c1 domain in pasteurella multocida toxin.
AB  == pasteurella multocida toxin (pmt) is a virulence factor responsible for the pathogenesis of some forms of pasteurellosis. the toxin activates g(q)- and g(12/13)-dependent pathways through the deamidation of a glutamine residue in the alpha-subunit of heterotrimeric gtpases. we recently reported the crystal structure of the c terminus (residues 575-1285) of pmt (c-pmt), which is composed of three domains (c1, c2, and c3), and that the c1 domain is involved in the localization of c-pmt to the plasma membrane, and the c3 domain possesses a cysteine protease-like catalytic triad. in this study, we analyzed the membrane-targeting function of the c1 domain in detail. the c1 domain consists of seven helices of which the first four (residues 590-670), showing structural similarity to the n terminus of clostridium difficile toxin b, were found to be involved in the recruitment of c-pmt to the plasma membrane. c-pmt lacking these  helices (c-pmt deltac1(4h)) neither localized to the plasma membrane nor stimulated the g(q/12/13)-dependent signaling pathways. when the membrane-targeting property was complemented by a peptide tag with an n-myristoylation motif, c-pmt deltac1(4h) recovered the pmt activity. direct binding between the c1 domain and liposomes containing phospholipids was evidenced by surface plasmon resonance analyses. these results indicate that the  c1 domain of c-pmt functions as a targeting signal for the plasma membrane.

TI  == analysis of the biosynthesis genes and chemical components of the capsule of avibacterium paragallinarum.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate biosynthesis genes and chemical components of the capsule of avibacterium paragallinarum. the sequence of a 10-kb region containing the capsule biosynthetic locus of av. paragallinarum was determined. two reference strains, i.e., 221 (serovar a) and h18 (serovar c), together with four taiwanese field strains (all serovar c) were sequenced. the results showed that there are two genotypes (i and ii) of the capsule biosynthetic locus in av. paragallinarum, and the capsule genotype is independent of the serovar. the capsule biosynthetic loci of genotypes i and ii consisted of  six and five genes, respectively. the genotype i genes encoded proteins that are  most similar to proteins from pasteurella multocida capsule types a and f while the genotype ii genes encoded proteins most similar to proteins from p. multocida capsule type d and escherichia coli k5. the results suggested that genotype i strains contain hyaluronan or chondroitin in the capsule wall while genotype ii contain heparosan. enzymatic digestion of the capsule materials extracted from av. paragallinarum showed that genotype i strains contained chondroitin while genotype ii strains contained heparosan in the capsule. this is the first report  on the existence of different genotypes of capsule biosynthesis genes in av. paragallinarum and the presence of chondroitin and heparosan as chemical components of the capsule of av. paragallinarum.

TI  == expression of 4 truncated fragments of pasteurella multocida toxin and their immunogenicity.
AB  == pasteurella multocida toxin (pmt) is a poor antigen that becomes more immunogenic after its native structure has been destroyed. in contrast, partially truncated pmt proteins, which are predicted to be good antigens when used as a vaccine, might be used to improve the control of atrophic rhinitis in pigs. in this study, 4 truncated pmt fragments were expressed in escherichia coli, and those 4 fragments were inoculated into mice to produce the polyclonal antibodies. the results of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) revealed that #1 and #4 fragments were the most immunogenic. immunized mice were subsequently challenged  intraperitoneally with p. multocida type d. five of the eight #1 fragment-immunized mice showed some protection against death and bacterial clearance. pigs immunized with #1 fragment produced no or mild atrophic rhinitis  (turbinate conchal score) after challenge, suggesting that this #1 fragment could be a good candidate for a subunit recombinant-type vaccine.

TI  == multiresistance in pasteurella multocida is mediated by coexistence of small plasmids.
AB  == in most gram-negative bacteria, acquired multiresistance is conferred by large plasmids compiling numerous antimicrobial resistance genes. here, we show an evolutionary alternative strategy used by pasteurella multocida to become resistant to multiple clinically relevant antibiotics. thirteen beta-lactam-resistant clinical isolates, concomitantly resistant to tetracyclines and/or streptomycin as well as to sulfonamides, were studied. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed different profiles among the isolates, showing  that clonal dissemination was not the sole event responsible for the spread of multiresistance. each p. multocida strain carried two or three small plasmids between 4 and 6 kb in size. a direct association between resistance profile and plasmid content was found. complete nucleotide sequencing of all plasmids revealed seven different replicons, six of them belonging to the cole1 superfamily. all plasmids carried one, or a maximum of two, antimicrobial resistance determinants. plasmids pb1000 and pb1002 bore bla(rob-1), pb1001 carried tet(b), pb1003 and pb1005 carried sul2 and stra, pb1006 harbored tet(o),  and p9956 bore the tet(h) gene. all plasmids except pb1002 and pb1006 were successfully transformed into escherichia coli. pb1000, also involved in beta-lactam resistance in haemophilus parasuis (a. san millan et al., antimicrob. agents chemother. 51:2260-2264, 2007), was mobilized in e. coli using the conjugation machinery of an incp plasmid. stability experiments proved that pb1000 was stable in p. multocida but highly unstable in e. coli. in conclusion,  bla(rob-1) is responsible for beta-lactam resistance in p. multocida in spain. coexistence and the spread of small plasmids are used by p. multocida to become multiresistant.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance of chicken escherichia coli, salmonella spp., and pasteurella multocida isolates.
AB  == escherichia coli, salmonella species, and pasteurella multocida are the major bacterial pathogens isolated from poultry. difference in susceptibility to antibiotics by microorganisms has become a major factor in drug choice and success of treatment. great concerns have been raised regarding emerging antimicrobial resistance among bacteria that may result in unpredictable antimicrobial susceptibility and failure of therapy. the primary objective of the present study was to determine the levels of antimicrobial susceptibility/resistance of e. coli, salmonella species, and p. multocida isolated from diseased chickens. a total of 445 e. coli isolates, 387 salmonella  spp. isolates, and 80 p. multocida isolates from diseased chickens during the period ranging from 2001 to 2003 were obtained. minimal inhibitory concentrations of 14 antimicrobial agents against each bacterial isolate were determined using a microbroth dilution assay described by the clinical laboratory standards institute. resistance of e. coli isolates measured as follows: 98.20% were resistant to tilmicosin, 79.33% to tetracycline, 51.46% to spectinomycin, 44.04%  to gentamicin, and 40% to ampicillin. resistance to tetracycline was found in 72.61% of salmonella spp. isolated, followed by resistance to spectinomycin (68.48%), ampicillin (63.57%), gentamicin (63.31%), and ticarcillin (61.76%). the resistance rate of p. multocida isolates to all antimicrobials tested was less than 5%, except for tetracycline (6.25%). in summary, e. coli and salmonella isolates were sensitive to ceftiofur and fluoroquinolones but were resistant to other antimicrobials tested, while p. multocida isolates remained sensitive to all the antimicrobial agents tested in a 3-yr analysis.

TI  == pasteurella multocida toxin activation of heterotrimeric g proteins by deamidation.
AB  == pasteurella multocida toxin is a major virulence factor of pasteurella multocida, which causes pasteurellosis in men and animals and atrophic rhinitis in rabbits and pigs. the approximately 145 kda protein toxin stimulates various signal transduction pathways by activating heterotrimeric g proteins of the galpha(q), galpha(i), and galpha(12/13) families by using an as yet unknown mechanism. here, we show that pasteurella multocida toxin deamidates glutamine-205 of galpha(i2) to glutamic acid. therefore, the toxin inhibits the intrinsic gtpase activity of  galpha(i) and causes persistent activation of the g protein. a similar modification is also evident for galpha(q), but not for the closely related galpha(11), which is not a substrate of pasteurella multocida toxin. our data identify the alpha-subunits of heterotrimeric g proteins as the direct molecular  target of pasteurella multocida toxin and indicate that the toxin does not act like a protease, which was suggested from its thiol protease-like catalytic triad, but instead causes constitutive activation of g proteins by deamidase activity.

AB  == the hyaluronic acid-rich capsules make affected bacteria relatively retractile to transformation. in this work, native hyaluronidase produced in situ by staphylococcus aureus, was investigated to replace the pure enzyme in bacterial capsule depolymerization and its subsequent genetic transformation. the encapsulated pasteurella multocida x73 was cultivated as a mixed culture with a hyaluronidase-producing strain of s. aureus. then different concentrations (50 ng and 200 ng) of the pasteurella-escherichia coli shuttle vector ppba1100 were electro-transformed into 40 microl of the mentioned culture. recombinants were selected on nutrient agar supplemented with 50 microg/ml of kanamycine (kan). the effects of a capsule-weakening agent on electroporation rates were also evaluated. the use of this technique has allowed us to attain transformation frequencies 10(5) times higher than a previously available protocol using pure enzyme. a control experiment involving a non-hyaluronidase-producing strain s. aureus substantiated the effect of the staphylococcal enzyme. the proposed alternative method could be also used for genetic transformation for other capsulated bacteria, which is not possible without pure hyaluronidase.

AB  == a total of 233 isolates of pasteurella multocida were obtained from 2,912 cases of clinical respiratory disease in pigs in china, giving an isolation rate of 8.0%. serogroup a p. multocida isolates were isolated from 92 cases (39.5%), and  serogroup d isolates were isolated from 128 cases (54.9%); 12 isolates (5.2%) were untypeable. p. multocida was the fourth most frequent pathogenic bacterium recovered from the respiratory tract, after streptococcus suis, haemophilus parasuis, and escherichia coli. all isolates were characterized for their susceptibilities to 20 antibiotics and the presence of 19 genes for virulence factors (vfs). the frequency of antimicrobial resistance among p. multocida isolates from swine in china was higher than that reported among p. multocida isolates from swine in from other countries, and 93.1% of the isolates showed multiple-drug resistance. there was a progressive increase in the rate of multiresistance to more than seven antibiotics, from 16.2% in 2003 to 62.8% in 2007. the resistance profiles suggested that cephalosporins, florfenicol, and fluoroquinolones were the drugs most likely to be active against p. multocida. use of pcr showed that colonization factors (ptfa, fima, and hsf-2), iron acquisition factors, sialidases (nanh), and outer membrane proteins occurred in most porcine strains. the vfs pfha, tadd, toxa, and pmhas were each present in <50% of strains. the various vfs exhibited distinctive associations with serogroups: concentrated in serogroup a, concentrated in serogroup d, or occurring jointly in serogroups a and d. these findings provide novel insights into the epidemiological characteristics of porcine p. multocida isolates and suggest that the potential threat of such multiresistant bacteria in food-producing animals should not be neglected.

AB  == the cp36 gene encoding an adhesive protein was amplified by pcr from genomic dna  of rabbit p. multocida c51-3 strain, and cloned into the pmd18-t vector and then  sequenced. the mature adhesive protein without a signal peptide of cpm36 gene was amplified by pcr from the recombinant plasmid pmd18-cp36, then cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pqe30 to provide a recombinant plasmid pqe30-cpm36. the recombinant protein of cpm36 was produced in escherichia coli m15 harboring the recombinant plasmid pqe30-cpm36 by iptg induction, and the recombinant protein purified by the affinity chromatography with ni(2+)-nta resin. the sequence analyses showed that the orf of cp36 gene was 1032 bp in length, and dna homology of the cp36 genes between the c51-3 strain and the previously reported different serotype strains of p. multocida in genbank was 76.9 to 100%. the sds-page analyses revealed a single fusion protein band with a molecular weight of 37 kd, and the western blotting analysis demonstrated that the recombinant protein cpm36 and native 36 kd protein of c51-3 were recognized specifically by an antiserum against the recombinant protein, suggesting that the recombinant protein is an antigenic protein.

TI  == pattern classification of phylogeny signals.
AB  == in this paper we propose the minimum entropy clustering (mec) method for clustering genes based on their phylogenetic signals. this entropy based method will cluster two genes together when their concatenation can decrease the entropy. an integral feature of mec is that it chooses the number of clusters automatically, which is a major advantage over the other methods. our simulation  results show that this method is quite successful in clustering genes with a common phylogeny.

TI  == complete chemoenzymatic synthesis of the forssman antigen using novel glycosyltransferases identified in campylobacter jejuni and pasteurella multocida.
AB  == we have identified an alpha1,4-galactosyltransferase (cgtd) and a beta1,3-n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (cgte) in the lipooligosaccharide (los) locus of campylobacter jejuni lio87. strains that carry these genes may have the  capability of synthesizing mimics of the p blood group antigens of the globoseries glycolipids. we have also identified an alpha1,3-n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (pm1138) from pasteurella multocida pm70, which is involved in the synthesis of an los-bound forssman antigen mimic and represents the only known bacterial glycosyltransferase with this specificity. the genes encoding the three enzymes were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli as soluble recombinant proteins that can be used to chemoenzymatically synthesize the forssman antigen, and its biosynthetic precursors, in high yields.

TI  == usage of antimicrobials and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria from mink.
AB  == the usage of antimicrobials for treatment of mink and the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance among the most important bacterial pathogens in mink was investigated. the aim of the study was to provide data, which may serve as a basis for the formulation of recommendations for prudent use of antimicrobials for mink. a total of 164 haemolytic staphylococci, 49 haemolytic streptococci, 39 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 13 pasteurella multocida, and 1093 escherichia coli isolates from danish mink were included in the study. a high frequency of resistance among s. intermedius was found for tetracyclines (54.7%), followed by  penicillin (21.7%), lincosamides (20.4%), macrolides (19.1%), and spectinomycin (18.5%). very low frequencies of resistance were recorded for other antimicrobials. the highest frequency among the e. coli isolates was recorded for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulphonamides, and tetracyclines, whereas resistance to other antimicrobials was rare. all p. aeruginosa were sensitive to gentamicin and colistin and sensitive or intermediate to enrofloxacin, whereas most isolates were resistant to all other antimicrobials. all p. multocida and haemolytic streptococci were sensitive to penicillin. there was a steady increase in the use of antimicrobials during the period 2001-2006, the majority of the prescribed amount being extended spectrum penicillins followed by aminoglycosides, sulphonamides with trimethoprim, and macrolides.

TI  == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle in different european countries: 2002-2004.
AB  == background: the project "antibiotic resistance in bacteria of animal origin - ii" (arbao-ii) was funded by the european union (fair5-qlk2-2002-01146) for the period 2003-2005, with the aim to establish a continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility among veterinary laboratories in european countries  based on validated and harmonised methodologies. available summary data of the susceptibility testing of the bacterial pathogens from the different laboratories were collected. method: antimicrobial susceptibility data for several bovine pathogens were obtained over a three year period (2002-2004). each year the participating laboratories were requested to fill in excel-file templates with national summary data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance from different bacterial species.a proficiency test (eqas - external quality assurance system) for antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted each year to test  the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the participating laboratories. the data from this testing demonstrated that for the species included in the eqas the results are comparable between countries. results: data  from 25,241 isolates were collected from 13 european countries. for staphylococcus aureus from bovine mastitis major differences were apparent in the occurrence of resistance between countries and between the different antimicrobial agents tested. the highest frequency of resistance was observed for penicillin. for mannheimia haemolytica resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulphonamide were observed in france, the netherlands and portugal.  all isolates of pasteurella multocida isolated in finland and most of those from  denmark, england (and wales), italy and sweden were susceptible to the majority of the antimicrobials. streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus uberis isolates from sweden were fully susceptible. for the other countries some resistance was observed to tetracycline, gentamicin and erythromycin. more resistance and variation of the resistance levels between countries were observed for escherichia coli compared to the other bacterial species investigated. conclusion: in general, isolates from denmark, england (and wales), the netherlands, norway, sweden and switzerland showed low frequencies of resistance, whereas many isolates from belgium, france, italy, latvia and spain were resistant to most antimicrobials tested. in the future, data on the prevalence of resistance should be used to develop guidelines for appropriate antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine.

TI  == vaccination with pasteurella multocida recombinant ompa induces strong but non-protective and deleterious th2-type immune response in mice.
AB  == pasteurella multocida ompa (pmompa) belongs to the major and multifunctional escherichia coli ompa family of proteins. we have previously reported that the protein is conserved, immunogenic and an adhesin that binds host cells and host cell extracellular matrix molecules [dabo sm, confer aw, quijano-blas ra. molecular and immunological characterization of pasteurella multocida serotype a:3 ompa: evidence of its role in p. multocida interaction with extracellular matrix molecules. microb pathog 2003;35(4):147-157]. in this study, we found that immunization of mice with the recombinant pmompa elicited strong th2-type immune  response, characterized by high immunoglobulin g(1) (igg(1)) antibodies production. subsequent intraperitoneal homologous challenge of the immunized mice resulted in lack of protection associated with the high igg(1) titers in anti-rpmompa sera. furthermore, the protection afforded by vaccination with p. multocida omps alone was adversely affected by the addition of the rpmompa to the vaccine preparations. the results demonstrate that pmompa has a detrimental effect on the efficacy of vaccination with omps in mice. targeted inactivation of pmompa gene in p. multocida 232 represents a potential mean towards the development of an effective vaccine candidate.

TI  == pasteurella multocida sialic acid aldolase: a promising biocatalyst.
AB  == sialic acid aldolases or n-acetylneuraminate lyases (nanas) catalyze the reversible aldol cleavage of n-acetylneuraminic acid (neu5ac) to form pyruvate and n-acetyl-d: -mannosamine (mannac). a capillary electrophoresis assay was developed to directly characterize the activities of nanas in both neu5ac cleavage and neu5ac synthesis directions. the assay was used to obtain the ph profile and the kinetic data of a nana cloned from pasteurella multocida p-1059 (pmnana) and a previously reported recombinant escherichia coli k12 nana (ecnana). both enzymes are active in a broad ph range of 6.0-9.0 in both reaction directions and have similar kinetic parameters. substrates specificity studies showed that 5-o-methyl-mannac, a mannac derivative, can be used efficiently as a  substrate by pmnana, but not efficiently by ecnana, for the synthesis of 8-o-methyl neu5ac. in addition, pmnana (250 mg l(-1) culture) has a higher expression level (2.5-fold) than ecnana (94 mg l(-1) culture). the higher expression level and a broader substrate tolerance make pmnana a better catalyst  than ecnana for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of sialic acids and their derivatives.

TI  == disruption of fak signaling: a side mechanism in cytotoxicity.
AB  == focal adhesion kinase (fak) is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase (ptk) which acts as an early modulator in the integrin signaling cascade. fak phosphorylation and its consequent activation regulate several basic biological cellular functions. on the contrary, dysregulation of fak signaling is implicated in the malignant transformation of cells, as well as in nonmalignant pathological conditions. with respect to cytotoxicity, accumulating data indicate that fak participates in the mechanism of action of the known cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ros). additionally, evidence was presented that different cytotoxic substances, such as arsenic (as), lead (pb), acrylamide, methylisothiazolinone (mit), dichlorovinylcysteine (dcvc) and halothane, acted, at least in part, by downregulating fak tyrosine phosphorylation, while the bacterial toxins pasteurella multocida toxin and escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor, have been shown to exert cytotoxic effects by inducing fak tyrosine phosphorylation. the observation that upregulation as well as downregulation of fak activity both result in cytotoxic effects seems contradictory. even though a  common mode of action, with respect to the dysregulation of fak signaling, for these cytotoxic substances has not yet been discovered, a cumulative approach could be established by focusing on fak activation and signaling cascade. according to these data, interfering with fak signaling might be of a potential use in blocking these cytotoxic effects. further studies are needed on the possible implication of fak in substance-induced cytotoxicity, as well as the possibility that such effects might be hindered or even blocked by restoring fak  signaling.

TI  == quantitative resistance level (mic) of bacterial pathogens (escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella sp., staphylococcus aureus) isolated from chickens and turkeys: national resistance monitoring by the bvl 2004/2005.
AB  == in the study 2004/2005, the current quantitative resistance level of escherichia  coli, pasteurella multocida, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella sp. and staphylococcus aureus from chickens and turkeys was determined for the first time within the framework of the national resistance monitoring of the federal office  of consumer protection and food safety (bvl). the objective was to implement a valid database on the basis of which the development and spread of resistance can be evaluated and monitored. during the investigation period from january 2004 to  february 2005,927 strains were collected and 857 (92%) bacteria strains which corresponded to the specifications of the study protocol were tested with the broth microdilution method to determine the in vitro susceptibility (minimum inhibitory concentration) to 22 to 28 antimicrobial agents or antibiotic combinations. the results document a prevalence of resistance that exceeds that of bacterial pathogens of other animal species, especially in the case of tetracycline. apart for s. aureus, clinical resistance to fluoroquinolones can still be considered low in poultry pathogens (e. coli approx. 2%). by applying the micg of 4 mg/l for enrofloxacin, a susceptibility of approximately 78 % was calculated for s. aureus. a comparison of the prevalence of resistance between chickens and turkeys, showed that a slightly higher prevalence of resistance can  be expected in turkeys. differences between the susceptibility data of chicks and adult animals could only be found in turkeys. in the case of e. coli, the prevalence of resistance of strains isolated from adult turkeys was up to 10% higher than those isolated from chicks for the corresponding antimicrobial agents. it must be pointed out that the number of e. coli strains from adult turkeys was much higher (n = 194) than the number from turkey chicks (n = 21). the results indicate clearly that in a resistance monitoring system it is necessary to categorise poultry by animal species (chicken, turkey) as well as by production stage and type (broiler, laying hen), so that the epidemiology of resistance can be correctly represented and evaluated. this information is the basis for the development of long-term management options for minimizing antibiotic resistance. furthermore, the knowledge of prevailing resistance levels in germany is a valuable tool for veterinary practitioners when determining an empirical therapy. the data collected by the bvl make an important contribution to the optimisation of the safety of food from animals, and thus to improving consumer protection.

TI  == a multidomain outer membrane protein from pasteurella multocida: modelling and simulation studies of pmompa.
AB  == pmompa is a two-domain outer membrane protein from pasteurella multocida. the n-terminal domain of pmompa is a homologue of the transmembrane beta-barrel domain of ompa from escherichia coli, whilst the c-terminal domain of pmompa is a homologue of the extra-membrane neisseria meningitidis rmpm c-terminal domain. this enables a model of a complete two domain pmompa to be constructed and its conformational dynamics explored via md simulations of the protein embedded within two different phospholipid bilayers (dmpc and dmpe). the conformational stability of the transmembrane beta-barrel is similar to that of a homology model of oprf from pseudomonas aeruginosa in bilayer simulations. there is a degree of  water penetration into the interior of the beta-barrel, suggestive of a possible  transmembrane pore. although the pmompa model is stable over 20 ns simulations, retaining its secondary structure and fold integrity throughout, substantial flexibility is observed in a short linker region between the n- and the c-terminal domains. at low ionic strength, the c-terminal domain moves to interact electrostatically with the lipid bilayer headgroups. this study demonstrates that computational approaches may be applied to more complex, multi-domain outer membrane proteins, rather than just to transmembrane beta-barrels, opening the possibility of in silico proteomics approaches to such  proteins.

AB  == to facilitate the control of progressive atrophic rhinitis (par) of swine caused  by toxigenic pasteurella multocida, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)  and a serum neutralization test (nt) have recently been developed to detect antibodies against the p. multocida dermonecrotic toxin (pmdnt). however, the nt  is a cumbersome and time-consuming technique. to overcome these drawbacks, we developed an indirect elisa, using recombinant pmdnt expressed in escherichia coli, for the detection of antibodies to pmdnt in serum samples from pigs. the practical usefulness of this elisa was compared with the nt using serum samples obtained from experimentally infected and naturally infected pigs. in the pigs experimentally inoculated with vaccine including pmdnt toxoid, the elisa and neutralization antibodies were detected at almost the same time, and a good correlation was demonstrated between both tests (p<0.01, r(2)=0.807). therefore,  the elisa can be used to evaluate the immune reaction of pigs after vaccination with p. multocida toxoid. in a survey conducted on a field herd with a history of clinical ar, the seropositivity by elisa in pigs of age 4.5-6 months was increased even though the nt was negative, and the correlation was low between the results obtained with the two tests (p<0.01, r(2)=0.38). therefore, the results indicated that this elisa might be a useful alternative to the nt currently used to detect the antibody to pmdnt after vaccination or infection with p. multocida.

TI  == ompa: gating and dynamics via molecular dynamics simulations.
AB  == outer membrane proteins (omps) of gram-negative bacteria have a variety of functions including passive transport, active transport, catalysis, pathogenesis  and signal transduction. whilst the structures of approximately 25 omps are currently known, there is relatively little known about their dynamics in different environments. the outer membrane protein, ompa from escherichia coli has been studied extensively in different environments both experimentally and computationally, and thus provides an ideal test case for the study of the dynamics and environmental interactions of outer membrane proteins. we review molecular dynamics simulations of ompa and its homologues in a variety of different environments and discuss possible mechanisms of pore gating. the transmembrane domain of e. coli ompa shows subtle differences in dynamics and interactions between a detergent micelle and a lipid bilayer environment. simulations of the crystallographic unit cell reveal a micelle-like network of detergent molecules interacting with the protein monomers. simulation and modelling studies emphasise the role of an electrostatic-switch mechanism in the  pore-gating mechanism. simulation studies have been extended to comparative models of ompa homologues from pseudomonas aeruginosa (oprf) and pasteurella multocida (pmompa), the latter model including the periplasmic c-terminal domain.

TI  == outer membrane permeability for nonpolar antimicrobial agents underlies extreme susceptibility of pasteurella multocida to the hydrophobic biocide triclosan.
AB  == pasteurella multocida exhibits nonspecific susceptibility to nonpolar antimicrobial agents such as triclosan, despite possessing an ultrastructurally typical gram-negative cell envelope. capsulated and noncapsulated cell surface variants were examined to investigate the role outer membrane permeability plays  in triclosan susceptibility. test strains were unable to initiate growth in the presence of bile salts and were susceptible to triclosan with minimal inhibitory  concentrations (mics) ranging from 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml. disk agar diffusion bioassays revealed triclosan susceptibility to be dose dependent and all strains  were susceptible to the hydrophobic antibiotics novobiocin, rifamycin sv, and chloramphenicol. triclosan minimal bactericidal concentrations were greater than  mics, thereby suggesting that dose dependency reflected both bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects. total and viable cell density growth kinetic determinations revealed a triclosan concentration of 2.0 microg/ml resulted in loss of batch culture viability within 4-24 h. concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 microg/ml exerted either a bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect depending on the strain. uptake of the hydrophobic probe 1-n-phenylnaphthylamine was greater in p. multocida strains than refractory control organisms pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli thereby suggesting the presence of phospholipid bilayer regions in the outer membrane. because triclosan inhibits a conserved enoyl-acp reductase necessary for bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis, these data support the notion that extreme susceptibility in p. multocida is due to the general inability of the outer membrane to exclude nonpolar compounds. moreover, susceptibility is independent of the presence of capsular material and the biocide is bactericidal in a concentration dependent manner.

TI  == one-pot three-enzyme chemoenzymatic approach to the synthesis of sialosides containing natural and non-natural functionalities.
AB  == chemoenzymatic synthesis, which combines the flexibility of chemical synthesis and the high selectivity of enzymatic synthesis, is a powerful approach to obtain complex carbohydrates. it is a preferred method for synthesizing sialic acid-containing structures, including those with diverse naturally occurring and  non-natural sialic acid forms, different sialyl linkages and different glycans that link to the sialic acid. starting from n-acetylmannosamine, mannose or their chemically or enzymatically modified derivatives, sialic acid aldolase-catalyzed  condensation reaction leads to the formation of sialic acids and their derivatives. these compounds are subsequently activated by a cmp-sialic acid synthetase and transferred to a wide range of suitable acceptors by a suitable sialyltransferase for the formation of sialosides containing natural and non-natural functionalities. the three-enzyme coupled synthesis of sialosides can be carried out in one pot without the isolation of intermediates. the time for synthesis is 4-18 h. purification and characterization of the product can be completed within 2-3 d.

TI  == identification of novel immunogens in pasteurella multocida.
AB  == p. multocida is a gram-negative pathogen responsible for causing diseases in animals of economic significance to livestock industries throughout the world. current vaccines include bacterins, which provide only limited protection against homologous serotypes. therefore there is a need for more effective vaccines to control diseases caused by p. multocida. as a step towards developing vaccines against fowl cholera, a genomics based approach was applied for the identification of novel immunogens. results: bioinformatics analysis of the p. multocida genome predicted 129 proteins as secreted, located in the outer membrane, or lipoproteins. 105 of the genes encoding these proteins were cloned and recombinant protein expressed in escherichia coli. polyclonal serum from p. multocida-infected chickens reacted with a subset of these proteins. conclusion:  these data show the range of bacterial immunogens recognized by the chicken immune system, including 6 novel immunoreactive proteins.

TI  == acceptor specificity of the pasteurella hyaluronan and chondroitin synthases and  production of chimeric glycosaminoglycans.
AB  == the hyaluronan (ha) synthase, pmhas, and the chondroitin synthase, pmcs, from the gram-negative bacterium pasteurella multocida polymerize the glycosaminoglycan (gag) sugar chains ha or chondroitin, respectively. the recombinant escherichia coli-derived enzymes were shown previously to elongate exogenously supplied oligosaccharides of their cognate gag (e.g. ha elongated by pmhas). here we show  that oligosaccharides and polysaccharides of certain noncognate gags (including sulfated and iduronic acid-containing forms) are elongated by pmhas (e.g. chondroitin elongated by pmhas) or pmcs. various acceptors were tested in assays  where the synthase extended the molecule with either a single monosaccharide or a long chain (approximately 10(2-4) sugars). certain gags were very poor acceptors  in comparison to the cognate molecules, but elongated products were detected nonetheless. overall, these findings suggest that for the interaction between the acceptor and the enzyme (a) the orientation of the hydroxyl at the c-4 position of the hexosamine is not critical, (b) the conformation of c-5 of the hexuronic acid (glucuronic versus iduronic) is not crucial, and (c) additional negative sulfate groups are well tolerated in certain cases, such as on c-6 of the hexosamine, but others, including c-4 sulfates, were not or were poorly tolerated. in vivo, the bacterial enzymes only process unsulfated polymers; thus  it is not expected that the pmcs and pmhas catalysts would exhibit such relative  relaxed sugar specificity by acting on a variety of animal-derived sulfated or epimerized gags. however, this feature allows the chemoenzymatic synthesis of a variety of chimeric gag polymers, including mimics of proteoglycan complexes.

TI  == the functional molecular mass of the pasteurella hyaluronan synthase is a monomer.
AB  == hyaluronan (ha), a linear polysaccharide composed of beta1,3-glcnac-beta1,4-glcua repeats, is found in the extracellular matrix of vertebrate tissues as well as the capsule of several pathogenic bacteria. all known ha synthases (hass) are dual-action glycosyltransferases that catalyze the addition of two different sugars from udp-linked precursors to the growing ha chain. the bacterial hyaluronan synthase, pmhas from gram-negative pasteurella multocida, is a 972-residue membrane-associated protein. previously, the gram-positive streptococcus pyogenes enzyme, sphas (419 residues), and the vertebrate enzyme, xlhas1 (588 residues), were found to function as monomers of protein, but the pmhas is not similar at the protein sequence level and has quite different enzymological properties. we have utilized radiation inactivation to measure the  target size of recombinant full-length and truncated pmhas. the target size of has activity was confirmed using internal enzyme standards of known molecular weight. we found that the pasteurella ha synthase protein functions catalytically as a monomer. functional truncated soluble pmhas also behaves as a polypeptide monomer as assessed by gel filtration chromatography and light scattering.

TI  == gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase: domain structure and identification of residues important in substrate and glutathione binding.
AB  == in most organisms, glutathione (gsh) is synthesized by the sequential action of distinct enzymes, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-gcs) and gsh synthetase (gs). in streptococcus agalactiae, gsh synthesis is catalyzed by a single enzyme, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase (gamma-gcs-gs). the n-terminal sequence of gamma-gcs-gs is similar to escherichia coli gamma-gcs, but the c-terminal sequence is an atp-grasp domain more similar to d-ala, d-ala ligase than to any known gs. in the present studies, c-terminally and n-terminally truncated constructs were characterized in order to define the limits of the gamma-gcs and gs domains, respectively. although wt gamma-gcs-gs is nearly uninhibited by gsh (k(i) approximately 140 mm), shorter gamma-gcs domain constructs were unexpectedly found to be strongly inhibited (k(i) approximately 15 mm), reproducing a physiologically important regulation seen in monofunctional gamma-gcs enzymes. because studies with e. coli gamma-gcs implicate a flexible loop region in gsh binding, chimeras of s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs were made containing gamma-gcs domain flexible loop sequences from enterococcus faecalis and pasteurella multocida gamma-gcs-gs, isoforms that are inhibited by gsh. inhibition remained s. agalactiae-like (i.e., very weak). c-terminal constructs of gamma-gcs-gs have gs activity (0.01-0.04% of wt), but proper folding and significant gs activity required a covalently linked gamma-gcs domain. in addition, site-directed mutants in the middle region of the gamma-gcs-gs sequence established that gs activity depends on residues in a region that is also part of the gamma-gcs domain. our results provide new insights into the structure of gamma-gcs-gs and suggest gamma-gcs-gs evolved from a monomeric gamma-gcs that became c-terminally fused to a multimeric atp-grasp protein.

TI  == separate pathways for o acetylation of polymeric and monomeric sialic acids and identification of sialyl o-acetyl esterase in escherichia coli k1.
AB  == o acetylation at carbon positions 7 or 9 of the sialic acid residues in the polysialic acid capsule of escherichia coli k1 is catalyzed by a phase-variable contingency locus, neuo, carried by the k1-specific prophage, cus-3. here we describe a novel method for analyzing polymeric sialic acid o acetylation that involves the release of surface sialic acids by endo-n-acetylneuraminidase digestion, followed by fluorescent labeling and detection of quinoxalinone derivatives by chromatography. the results indicated that neuo is responsible for the majority of capsule modification that takes place in vivo. however, a minor neuo-independent o acetylation pathway was detected that is dependent on the bifunctional polypeptide encoded by neud. this pathway involves o acetylation of  monomeric sialic acid and is regulated by another bifunctional enzyme, neua, which includes n-terminal synthetase and c-terminal sialyl o-esterase domains. a  homologue of the neua c-terminal domain (pm1710) in pasteurella multocida was also shown to be an esterase, suggesting that it functions in the catabolism of acetylated environmental sialic acids. our combined results indicate a previously unexpected complexity in the synthesis and catabolism of microbial sialic and polysialic acids. these findings are key to understanding the biological functions of modified sialic acids in e. coli k1 and other species and may provide new targets for drug or vaccine development.

TI  == [rapid identification of riemerella anatipestifer on the basis of specific pcr amplifying 16s rdna].
AB  == riemerella anatipestifer (ra) infection is the main disease causing severe losses in duck production. because ra is characterized more by the absence than by the presence of specific phenotypic properties and different scholar had the different results of biochemical detection, it can't always be identified quickly and correctly only by the phenotypic properties or biochemical characteristics. the research object was to develop a species specific pcr method for ra detection. because of the conserved structure of rrna and appropriate size of 16s rrna, a multiple alignment of 16s rdna (gene coding 16s rrna) was processed among ra, escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, salmonella enteritidis and salmonella gallinarum, which are the main bacteria causing duck diseases. a pair  of species specific primers named 190f and 843r were selected from the variable regions of 16s rdna depending on the result of multiple alignment. using blast on ncbi website for a sequence similarity search, the results showed that this pair  of primers had very high specificity, except for having a lower sequence similarity with some species of flavobacterium and chryseobacterium. a pcr assay  was performed and the template was extracted using the bacteria genomic dna extraction kit and boiling method respectively. a chelate resin named chelex 100  was used in the boiling method at the same time. under the annealing temperature  of 60 degrees c, all the 26 ra strains, including 19 representative strains of serotypes 1 to approximately 19 and 7 domestic isolated strains, showed the same  654bp fragment after pcr, while there was no amplification with isolates of other bacterial species. also a series of sensitivity experiments were performed and proved that the detection limit of this method was 50pg genomic dna, 1.5 x 10(6)  cfu/ml and 15 cfu/ml, when the template was prepared with genomic dna extraction  kit, only boiling method and boiling method with chelex 100 respectively. 12 clinical cases which were probably infected with ra were chosen to identify the accuracy and sensitivity of this pcr method. several other conventional detecting methods including bacteria isolating, differentiating culture, biochemical experiments and serotyping were used at the same time. the templates of pcr were  extracted from brains or livers by boiling method with chelex 100. finally, 3 cases were identified as ra infection by the conventional methods and 4 by the pcr method, which proved the good accuracy and sensitivity of the pcr method. thus, this pcr assay provides a rapid and accurate method for identification of riemerella anatipestifer. it will help to make the final decision in clinical diagnose or species identification, especially when a new serotype or sub-serotype of ra comes up.

TI  == results of the antimicrobial agent susceptibility study raised in a representative, cross-sectional monitoring study on a national basis.
AB  == the use of antimicrobial substances in human and veterinary medicine inevitably results in a selection pressure for drug resistance in exposed bacteria. preventive measures, apt to avoid the consequent development of new resistances and selection for existing ones, respectively, have to be elaborated. moreover, it has to be ensured that neither resistant bacteria nor resistance genes are spread to and consequently via the food chain. respiratory diseases as well as mastitis in dairy cattle belong to the most frequently occurring diseases in food-producing animals. for the first time in germany, a comprehensive, cross-sectional study into the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria associated with these disease patterns in food-producing animals was conducted by the federal office of consumer protection and food safety (bvl) in 2001. the selection of examined bacterial species comprised pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica associated with respiratory disease in pigs, and escherichia coli, streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. causing mastitis in  dairy cattle. bacterial strains were collected following a representative sampling scheme, taking into account the total number of animals in the individual german federal lander. in an analogous study conducted in 2002/2003, this selection was extended by the indication respiratory disease in juvenile cattle, caused by p. multocida and m. haemolytica, respectively. in comparison with data from 2001, mic values determined in 2002/2003 suggested significantly lower or higher degrees of drug susceptibility only for a few antimicrobial agents. comparison was carried out on the basis of bacterial species and individual federal lander, respectively. overall, the data raised in both studies revealed substantially lower resistance rates than published for germany so far.  this is particularly true for results from those lander, whose animal health services had implemented preventive strategies to control infectious diseases. no correlation could be established between differing animal population densities and differences in the prevalence of resistance in corresponding lander. however, the geographical distribution of occurrence of resistance against beta-lactam antimicrobial agents suggests different therapeutic strategies employed in different sized animal flocks. in federal lander marked by large-scale livestock  farming, significantly higher resistance values could be measured for cephalosporins than for penicillins, whereas in lander with rather traditional farming structures, resistance to penicillins was predominant. assuming otherwise similar factors of influence on the emergence of resistance, this pattern suggests that cephalosporins are preferably used in large enterprises and penicillins in smaller farms, respectively. currently, mechanisms effecting changes in antimicrobial resistance are being further investigated in a successive study.

TI  == monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria from livestock animals.
AB  == facing the problem of development and spreading of bacterial resistance, preventive strategies are considered the most appropriate means to counteract. the establishment of corresponding management options relies on scientifically defensible efforts to obtain objective data on the prevalence of bacterial resistance in healthy and diseased livestock. additionally, detailed statistics are needed on the overall amount of antimicrobial agents dispensed in germany. the collection of valid data on the prevalence of resistance requires representative and cross-sectional studies. the german national antimicrobial resistance monitoring of the federal office of consumer protection and food safety (bvl) determines the current quantitative resistance level of life-stock pathogens, in order to permit the evaluation and surveillance of the distribution of resistances on a valid basis. essential key features determining the design of these studies comprise (1) a statistically valid sampling program. this incorporates regional differences in animal population density, (2) the avoidance of "copy strains", (3) testing of no more than two bacterial strains belonging to one species per herd, (4) testing only if no antimicrobial therapy preceded sample collection, and (5) the use of standardized methods [e.g. microdilution broth method to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic)]. the analysis and interpretation of this data permits reliable identification and definition of epidemiological characteristics of resistance and its development in animal associated bacteria, such as geographically and time wise differentiated profiles on its prevalence, the emergence of unknown phenotypes of resistance and an assessment of the threat resistant bacteria from animals pose for humans. in applied antimicrobial therapy, the data can serve as a decision guidance in choosing the antimicrobial agent most adapted to the prevailing epidemiological situation. the susceptibility testing performed by the bvl suggests substantially lower degrees of resistance in bacteria isolated from cattle (mastitis: escherichia coli, staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp.; respiratory disease: pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica) and pigs (respiratory disease: pasteurella multocida, bordetella bronchiseptica) in comparison to data published for germany so far. this includes results for substances that have given cause for frequent debate. only rare cases of resistance to enrofloxacin (fluoroquinolone) could be detected, and only 3% of bacterial strains tested proved resistant to 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins, including substances prescribed in human medicine.

AB  == three groups of five pigs were inoculated intratracheally with escherichia coli lipopolysaccharides, and 24 hours later with 10 x 10(9) colony-forming units of a non-toxigenic strain of pasteurella multocida type a; a fourth group was left uninoculated as controls. the three inoculated groups received either no treatment (positive controls), or were treated with 3 mg/kg ceftiofur intramuscularly once a day for five consecutive days, either alone or combined with 2 mg/kg flunixin intramuscularly once a day for three consecutive days. the  sustained coughing and hyperthermia recorded in the positive controls disappeared after two days and three days of treatments, respectively, in the treated animals, and the reductions in daily weight gain and changes in breathing pattern observed in the controls were not observed in the treated animals. there were no  significant differences between the pigs treated with ceftiofur alone or ceftiofur combined with flunixin. in the positive controls, the number of inflammatory cells in samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid continued to increase up to 15 days after inoculation, whereas in the treated animals there were similar increases at six days but the numbers had decreased to baseline levels after 15 days. similarly, in the treated animals the volume of the lung lesions was significantly less than in the control animals, but the inclusion of  flunixin in the treatment regimen had no significant additional effect.

TI  == prevalence of zoonotic agents in dogs visiting hospitalized people in ontario: implications for infection control.
AB  == visitation of hospitalized people by dogs is becoming commonplace, but little is  known about the potential health risks of introducing dogs to healthcare settings. this cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of zoonotic agents  in a group of 102 visitation dogs from a variety of sources across ontario. between may and july 2004, owners were interviewed by a standardized questionnaire while dogs underwent a standardized physical examination. one specimen of faeces, hair-coat brushings and one rectal, aural, nasal, oral and pharyngeal swab were collected from each dog and tested for 18 specific pathogens. all dogs were judged to be in good health. zoonotic agents were isolated from 80 out of 102 (80%) dogs. the primary pathogen was clostridium difficile, which was isolated from 58 (58%) faecal specimens. seventy-one percent (41/58) of these isolates were toxigenic. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase escherichia coli was isolated from one (1%) dog, extended-spectrum cephalosporinase e. coli was isolated from three (3%) dogs, and organisms of the  genus salmonella were isolated from three (3%) dogs. pasteurella multocida or pasteurella canis was isolated from 29 (29%) oral swabs, and malassezia pachydermatis was isolated from eight (8%) aural swabs. giardia antigen was present in the faeces of seven (7%) dogs, while toxocara canis and ancylostoma caninum were detected in two (2%) dogs and one (1%) dog, respectively. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, campylobacter spp., microsporum canis, group a streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and cryptosporidium spp. were not detected. further information is needed before the full implications of these findings for infection control can be assessed properly.

TI  == slyd proteins from different species exhibit high prolyl isomerase and chaperone  activities.
AB  == slyd is a putative folding helper protein from the escherichia coli cytosol, which consists of an n-terminal prolyl isomerase domain of the fkbp type and a presumably unstructured c-terminal tail. we produced truncated versions without this tail (slyd) for slyd from e. coli, as well as for the slyd orthologues from  yersinia pestis, treponema pallidum, pasteurella multocida, and vibrio cholerae.  they are monomeric in solution and unfold reversibly. all slyd variants catalyze  the proline-limited refolding of ribonuclease t1 with very high efficiencies, and the specificity constants (kcat/km) are equal to approximately 10(6) m(-1) s(-1). these large values originate from the high affinities of the slyd orthologues for unfolded rcm-t1, which are reflected in low km values of approximately 1 microm.  slyd also exhibits pronounced chaperone properties. permanently unfolded proteins bind with high affinity to slyd and thus inhibit its prolyl isomerase activity. the unfolded protein chains do not need to contain proline residues to be recognized and bound by slyd. the conservation of prolyl isomerase activity and chaperone properties within the slyd family suggests that these proteins might act as true folding helpers in the bacterial cytosol. the slyd proteins are also  well suited for biotechnological applications. as fusion partners they facilitate the refolding and increase the solubility of aggregation-prone proteins such as the gp41 ectodomain fragment of hiv-1.

TI  == critical elements of oligosaccharide acceptor substrates for the pasteurella multocida hyaluronan synthase.
AB  == three-dimensional structures are not available for polysaccharide synthases and only minimal information on the molecular basis for catalysis is known. the pasteurella multocida hyaluronan synthase (pmhas) catalyzes the polymerization of the alternating beta1,3-n-acetylglucosamine-beta1,4-glucuronic acid sugar chain by the sequential addition of single monosaccharides to the non-reducing terminus. therefore, pmhas possesses both glcnac-transferase and glucuronic acid  (glcua)-transferase activities. the recombinant escherichia coli-derived pmhas enzyme will elongate exogenously supplied hyaluronan chains in vitro with either  a single monosaccharide or a long chain depending on the udp-sugar availability.  competition studies using pairs of acceptors with distinct termini (where one oligosaccharide is a substrate that may be elongated, whereas the other cannot) were performed here; the lack of competition suggests that pmhas contains at least two distinct acceptor sites. we hypothesize that the size of the acceptor binding pockets of the enzyme corresponds to the size of the smallest high efficiency substrates; thus we tested the relative activity of a series of authentic hyaluronan oligosaccharides and related structural analogs. the glcua-transferase site readily elongates (glcnac-glcua)(2), whereas the glcnac-transferase elongates glcua-glc-nac-glcua. the minimally sized oligosaccharides, elongated with high efficiency, both contain a trisaccharide with two glucuronic acid residues that enabled the identification of a synthetic, artificial acceptor for the synthase. pmhas behaves as a fusion of two complete glycosyltransferases, each containing a donor site and an acceptor site, in one polypeptide. overall, this information advances the knowledge of glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis as well as assists the creation of various therapeutic sugars for medical applications in the future.

TI  == a multifunctional pasteurella multocida sialyltransferase: a powerful tool for the synthesis of sialoside libraries.
AB  == a multifunctional sialyltransferase has been cloned from pasteurella multocida strain p-1059 and expressed in e. coli as a truncated c-terminal his6-tagged recombinant protein (tpm0188ph). biochemical studies indicate that the obtained protein is (1) an alpha2,3-sialyltransferase (main function), (2) an alpha2,6-sialyltransferase, (3) an alpha2,3-sialidase, and (4) an alpha2,3-trans-sialidase. the recombinant tpm0188ph is a powerful tool in the synthesis of structurally diverse sialoside libraries due to its relaxed substrate specificity, high solubility, high expression level, and multifunctionality.

TI  == characterization of the bifunctional gamma-glutamate-cysteine ligase/glutathione  synthetase (gshf) of pasteurella multocida.
AB  == glutamate-cysteine ligase (gamma-ecl) and glutathione synthetase (gs) are the two unrelated ligases that constitute the glutathione biosynthesis pathway in most eukaryotes, purple bacteria, and cyanobacteria. gamma-ecl is a member of the glutamine synthetase family, whereas gs enzymes group together with highly diverse carboxyl-to-amine/thiol ligases, all characterized by the so-called two-domain atp-grasp fold. this generalized scheme toward the formation of glutathione, however, is incomplete, as functional steady-state levels of intracellular glutathione may also accumulate solely by import, as has been reported for the pasteurellaceae member haemophilus influenzae, as well as for certain gram-positive enterococci and streptococci, or by the action of a bifunctional fusion protein (termed gshf), as has been reported recently for the  gram-positive firmicutes streptococcus agalactiae and listeria monocytogenes. here, we show that yet another member of the pasteurellaceae family, pasteurella  multocida, acquires glutathione both by import and gshf-driven biosynthesis. domain architecture analysis shows that this p. multocida gshf bifunctional ligase contains an n-terminal gamma-proteobacterial gamma-ecl-like domain followed by a typical atp-grasp domain, which most closely resembles that of cyanophycin synthetases, although it has no significant homology with known gs ligases. recombinant p. multocida gshf overexpresses as an approximately 85-kda protein, which, on the basis of gel-sizing chromatography, forms dimers in solution. the gamma-ecl activity of gshf is regulated by an allosteric type of glutathione feedback inhibition (k(i) = 13.6 mm). furthermore, steady-state kinetics, on the basis of which we present a novel variant of half-of-the-sites reactivity, indicate intimate domain-domain interactions, which may explain the bifunctionality of gshf proteins.

TI  == serological characterization of haemophilus parasuis isolates from china.
AB  == from september 2002 to december 2004, a total of 281 strains of haemophilus parasuis were isolated from 17 provinces of china. all these isolates were serotyped by both the gel diffusion (gd) and the indirect haemagglutination (iha) tests. by combining the gd and iha results, serovar 4 (24.2%) and serovar 5 (19.2%) were the most prevalent serovars, followed by serovars 13 (12.5%), 14 (7.1%) and 12 (6.8%), while 12.1% of the isolates could not be assigned to a serovar (nontypable). a comparison of the number of isolates obtained from the respiratory tract of swine without polyserositis with those obtained from swine with polyserositis revealed an increased frequency of serovar 4 and a significantly decreased frequency of serovar 13 among isolates from the respiratory tract of swine without polyserositis, whereas the frequency of isolation of serovars 5, 12, 14 and nontypable from swine with or without polyserositis were similar. co-infection of h. parasuis and other bacterial agents was studied in 183 cases examined from june 2003 to december 2004. streptococcus suis (30.6%; 56), escherichia coli (21.9%; 40), bordetella bronchiseptica (21.3%; 39) and pasteurella multocida (14.2%; 26) were the bacterial agents frequently co-isolated with h. parasuis in china.

TI  == unexpected functional diversity among fadr fatty acid transcriptional regulatory  proteins.
AB  == the fadr protein of escherichia coli has been shown to play a dual role in transcription of the genes of bacterial fatty acid metabolism. the protein acts as a repressor of beta-oxidation and an activator of unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. fadr dna binding is antagonized by long chain acyl-coas, and thus fadr acts as a sensor of fatty acid availability in the environment. when viewed from  a genomic viewpoint, fadr proteins are unusual in that the dna binding domain is  very highly conserved among fadr-containing bacteria, whereas the c-terminal acyl-coa binding domain shows only weak conservation. to further our understanding of the role of fadr in bacterial lipid metabolism we have examined  the in vivo and in vitro properties of a diverse set of fadr proteins expressed in e. coli. in addition to e. coli fadr the proteins examined were those of salmonella enterica, vibrio cholerae, pasteurella multocida, and haemophilus influenzae. these fadr proteins were found to differ markedly in their effects on repression and induction of beta-oxidation in e. coli and in their acyl-coa binding abilities as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. the e. coli and s. enterica proteins were the most similar, although they differed in their effects on utilization of oleic acid and acyl-coa binding affinities, whereas the p. multocida and h. influenzae proteins showed only weak repression and poor acyl-coa binding affinities. the v. cholerae fadr was strikingly superior to the  other proteins in the amplitude of its regulatory response, and it bound long chain acyl-coas appreciably more strongly than the e. coli and s. enterica proteins. the significance of these findings is discussed in view of the protein  sequences and the physiological niches occupied by these organisms.

TI  == pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of flumequine in pigs after single intravenous and intramuscular administration.
AB  == the pharmacokinetics and intramuscular (im) bioavailability of flumequine (15 mgkg(-1)) were investigated in healthy pigs and the findings related to published minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for susceptible bacteria of animal origin, and to experimentally determined mics for susceptible strains of porcine  origin. we found mics for escherichia coli, salmonella spp., pasteurella spp. and bordetella spp. in the range 0.5 to >64 microg ml(-1) isolated from infected pigs in the forli area of italy; only the pasteurella multocida strains were sensitive (mic(90)=0.5 microg ml(-1)). after intravenous (iv) injection, flumequine was slowly distributed and eliminated (t(1/2lambda(1))1.40+/-0.16 h and t(1/2lambda(2))6.35+/-1.69 h). the distribution volume at steady state (v(dss)) was 752.59+/-84.03 ml kg(-1) and clearance (cl(b)) was 237.19+/-17.88 ml kg(-1)h(-1). after im administration, peak serum concentration (4.99+/-0.92 microg ml(-1)) was reached between the 2nd and the 3rd hour. the results on mic of isolated bacteria, although only indicative, suggest that the efficacy of flumequine on gram-negative bacteria may be impaired by the emergence of less sensitive or resistant strains.

TI  == synergistic action of e. coli endotoxin and pasteurella multocida type a for the  induction of bronchopneumonia in pigs.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate whether escherichia coli endotoxin (lps) may predispose the lung to an infection with pasteurella multocida type a (pma) and to determine the lps concentration needed to reproduce clinical signs of bronchopneumonia. twenty-four hours before inoculating pma or sterile growth medium, piglets were tracheally instilled with 10, 100 or 400 microg/kg lps. cough, body temperature, daily weight gain (dwg) bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) cells and volume of pneumonic lung were measured. changes in breathing pattern (penh) were assessed by whole body barometric plethysmography. no significant changes were observed in pma-treated or in control animals. each lps  doses induced dwg reduction while the higher generated a severe subacute interstitial pneumonia causing hyperthermia and an increase in penh. the combination of the lower lps doses with pma produced an asymptomatic bronchopneumonia leading to dwg reduction, rise in penh and an increase in balf macrophages and neutrophils. with 400 microg/kg lps, pma worsened the inflammatory process as illustrated by cough, hyperthermia, major dwg reduction and by a greater penh response. lung lesions consisted of severe exudative bronchopneumonia. we concluded that lps may negatively influence growth, predispose to persisting lung inflammatory process and promote pma infection depending on the dose previously administered.

TI  == the pasteurella multocida nrfe gene is upregulated during infection and is essential for nitrite reduction but not for virulence.
AB  == pasteurella multocida is the causative agent of a range of diseases with economic importance in production animals. many systems have been employed to identify virulence factors of p. multocida, including in vivo expression technology (ivet), signature-tagged mutagenesis, and whole-genome expression profiling. in a previous study in which ivet was used with p. multocida, nrfe was identified as a gene that is preferentially expressed in vivo. in escherichia coli, nrfe is part  of the formate-dependent nitrite reductase system involved in utilizing available nitrite as an electron accepter during growth under anaerobic conditions. in this study, we constructed an isogenic p. multocida strain that was unable to reduce nitrite under either aerobic or anaerobic conditions, thereby demonstrating that  p. multocida nrfe is essential for nitrite reduction. however, the nrfe mutant was still virulent in mice. real-time reverse transcription-pcr analysis indicated that nrfe was regulated independently of nrfabcd by an independent promoter that is likely to be upregulated in vivo.

TI  == sialic acid metabolism and systemic pasteurellosis.
AB  == pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida is a commensal and opportunistic pathogen  of food animals, wildlife, and pets and a zoonotic cause of human infection arising from contacts with these animals. here, an investigation of multiple serotype a strains demonstrated the occurrence of membrane sialyltransferase. although p. multocida lacks the genes for the two earliest steps in de novo sialic acid synthesis, adding sialic acid to the growth medium resulted in uptake, activation, and subsequent transfer of sialic acid to a membrane acceptor resembling lipooligosaccharide. two candidate-activating enzymes with homology to escherichia coli cytidine 5'-monophospho-n-acetylneuraminate synthetase were overproduced as histidine-tagged polypeptides. the synthetase encoded by pm0187 was at least 37 times more active than the pm1710 gene product, suggesting pm0187 encodes the primary sialic acid cytidylyltransferase in p. multocida. a sialate aldolase (pm1715) mutant unable to initiate dissimilation of internalized sialic  acid was not attenuated in the cd-1 mouse model of systemic pasteurellosis, indicating that the nutritional function of sialate catabolism is not required for systemic disease. in contrast, the attenuation of a sialate uptake-deficient  mutant supports the essential role in pathogenesis of a sialylation mechanism that is dependent on an environmental (host) supply of sialic acid. the combined  results provide the first direct evidence of sialylation by a precursor scavenging mechanism in pasteurellae and of a potential tripartite atp-independent periplasmic sialate transporter in any species.

TI  == development of a genetically modified nontoxigenic pasteurella multocida toxin as a candidate for use in vaccines against progressive atrophic rhinitis in pigs.
AB  == objective: to construct a genetically modified nontoxigenic pasteurella multocida toxin (pmt) and examine its immunoprotective activity against challenge exposure  with wild-type pmt in pigs. animals: 5 healthy pigs. procedure: a nontoxigenic pmt was created by replacing the serine at position 1164 with alanine (s1164a) and the cysteine at position 1165 with serine (c1165s). toxic activity was determined by use of the guinea pig skin test and mouse lethality test. three pigs were vaccinated twice with the modified pmt, and the remaining 2 pigs served as nonvaccinated control animals. vaccinated and control pigs were challenge exposed with wild-type pmt. pigs were euthanatized and necropsied on day 14 after challenge exposure. turbinate atrophy was examined macroscopically and assigned a score. serum anti-pmt antibodies were determined by use of an elisa. results: the genetically modified pmt was characterized by a total lack of toxic activity. pigs vaccinated with the modified pmt became seropositive; in contrast, control pigs remained seronegative. necropsy revealed that the 2 control pigs had moderate and severe turbinate atrophy, respectively, whereas the 3 vaccinated pigs did not have any lesions in the turbinates or abnormalities in other organs. conclusions and clinical relevance: modification by use of s1164a and c1165s leads to a complete loss of toxic effects of pmt without impairment of the ability to induce protective immunity in pigs. analysis of these results suggests that genetically modified pmt may represent a good candidate for use in developing a vaccine against progressive atrophic rhinitis in pigs.

TI  == hyaluronan biosynthesis by class i streptococcal hyaluronan synthases occurs at the reducing end.
AB  == previous studies reached different conclusions about whether class i hyaluronan synthases (hass) elongate hyaluronic acid (ha) by addition to the reducing or the nonreducing end. here we used two strategies to determine the direction of ha synthesis by purified class i hass from streptococcus equisimilis and streptococcus pyogenes. in the first strategy we used each of the two udp-sugar substrates separately to pulse label either the beginning or the end of ha chains. we then quantified the relative rates of radioactive ha degradation by treatment with beta-glycosidases that act at the nonreducing end. the results with both purified hass demonstrated that ha elongation occurred at the reducing  end. in the second strategy, we used purified s. equisimilis has, udp-glucuronic  acid, and udp[beta-32p]-glc-nac to radiolabel nascent ha chains. under conditions of limiting substrate, the 32p-labeled products were separated from the substrates by paper chromatography and identified as ha-[32p]udp saccharides based on their degradation by snake venom phosphodiesterase or hyaluronidase and  by their binding to a specific ha-binding protein. the 32p radioactivity was chased (released) by incubation with unlabeled udp-sugars, showing that the ha-udp linkages turn over during ha biosynthesis. in contrast, ha-[32p]udp products made by the purified class ii pasteurella multocida has were not released by adding unlabeled udp-sugars, consistent with growth at the nonreducing end for this enzyme. the results demonstrate that the streptococcal class i has enzymes polymerize ha chains at the reducing end.

TI  == pnuc and the utilization of the nicotinamide riboside analog 3-aminopyridine in haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == the utilization pathway for the uptake of nad and nicotinamide riboside was previously characterized for haemophilus influenzae. we now report on the cellular location, topology, and substrate specificity of pnuc. pnuc of h. influenzae is only distantly related to pnuc of escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. when e. coli pnuc was expressed in an h. influenzae pnuc mutant, it was able to take up only nicotinamide riboside and not nicotinamide mononucleotide. therefore, we postulated that pnuc transporters in general possess specificity for nicotinamide riboside. earlier studies showed that 3-aminopyridine derivatives (e.g., 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide) are inhibitory for h. influenzae growth. by testing characterized strains with mutations in the nad utilization pathway, we show that 3-aminopyridine riboside is inhibitory to h. influenzae and is taken up by the nad-processing and nicotinamide riboside route. 3-aminopyridine riboside is utilized effectively in  a pnuc+ background. in addition, we demonstrate that 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide resynthesis is produced by nadr. 3-aminopyridine riboside-resistant  h. influenzae isolates were characterized, and mutations in nadr could be detected. we also tested other species of the family pasteurellaceae, pasteurella multocida and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and found that 3-aminopyridine riboside does not act as a growth inhibitor; hence, 3-aminopyridine riboside represents an anti-infective agent with a very narrow host range.

TI  == identification and characterization of the pasteurella multocida toxin translocation domain.
AB  == the pasteurella multocida toxin (pmt) is a potent mitogen which enters the cytosol of eukaryotic cells via a low ph membrane translocation event. in common  with the escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1), the core of the  pmt translocation domain is composed of two predicted hydrophobic helices (h1 - residues 402-423, h2 - 437-457) linked by a hydrophilic loop (pmt-tl - 424-436).  the peptide loop contains three acidic residues (d425, d431 and e434), which may  play a role equivalent to d373, d379 and e382/383 in cnf1. to test this hypothesis, a series of point mutants was generated in which acidic residues were mutated into the permanently charged positive residue lysine. individual mutation of d425, d431 and e434 each caused a four- to sixfold reduction in toxin activity. interestingly, mutation of d401 located immediately outside the predicted helix-loop-helix motif completely abolished toxin activity. individual  mutations did not affect cell binding nor greatly altered toxin structure, but did prevent translocation of the surface-bound proteins into the cytosol after a  low ph pulse. moreover, we demonstrate using an in vitro assay that pmt undergoes a ph-dependent membrane insertion.

AB  == heparan sulfate/heparin n-deacetylase/n-sulfotransferase-1 (ndst-1) is a critical enzyme involved in heparan sulfate/heparin biosynthesis. this dual-function enzyme modifies the glcnac-glca disaccharide repeating sugar backbone to make n-sulfated heparosan. n-sulfation is an absolute requirement for the subsequent epimerization and o-sulfation steps in heparan sulfate/heparin biosynthesis. we have expressed rat liver (r) ndst-1 in saccharomyces cerevisiae as a soluble protein. the yeast-expressed enzyme has both n-deacetylase and n-sulfotransferase activities. n-acetyl heparosan, isolated from escherichia coli k5 polysaccharide, de-n-sulfated heparin (dnsh) and completely desulfated n-acetylated heparan sulfate (cdsnachs) are all good substrates for the rndst-1. however, n-desulfated, n-acetylated heparin (ndsnach) is a poor substrate. the rndst-1 was partially purified on heparin sepharose cl-6b. purified rndst-1 requires mn(2+) for its enzymatic activity, can utilize paps regenerated in vitro by the paps cycle (pap plus para-nitrophenylsulfate in the presence of arylsulfotransferase iv), and with the addition of exogenous paps is capable of producing 60-65% n-sulfated heparosan from e. coli k5 polysaccharide or pasteurella multocida polysaccharide.

TI  == pathophysiological changes occurring during escherichia coli endotoxin and pasteurella multocida challenge in piglets: relationship with cough and temperature and predicitive value for intensity of lesions.
AB  == the aims of this study were (1) to correlate cough and body temperature (bt) with the severity of bronchopneumonia in pigs, (2) to determine whether these clinical signs can be used to early diagnose bronchopneumonia and (3) to assess the predictive values of cough and bt regarding lung lesions. bronchopneumonia was induced by administering e. coli endotoxin (lps) combined with pasteurella multocida type a (pma) in the trachea of 13 piglets. saline-instilled negative controls (n = 8), pma inoculated (n = 6) and lps instilled (n = 5) groups were also constituted. cough and bt were recorded daily while the bronchopneumonia severity was assessed using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) cytology, cytokines and measurement of lung lesion volume. changes in expiratory breathing  pattern were also measured (penh). the combination of lps and pma induced a subacute bronchopneumonia characterised by macrophage, neutrophil, and lymphocyte infiltration, changes in penh and an increase in the mrna level of ifn-gamma while il8, il-18 and tnf-alpha mrna levels remained unchanged. the daily body weight gain of infected animals was significantly reduced. cough and bt changes were proportional to the intensity of the lung inflammatory process, functional respiratory changes and to the extent of macroscopic lesions. when comparing the  individual values of cough and bt to thresholds defined for both parameters, an early diagnosis of pneumonia was possible. considering the pooled data of each group, it was possible to define thresholds allowing an early segregation between the groups of diseased and healthy piglets. the daily values of cough and bt were predictive for the volume of lung lesions recorded at the end of the trial. in conclusion, cough and bt appear as potential indicators for the intensity and the evolution of the respiratory disease. they also seem to be good predictors for the magnitude of lung lesions and weight gain recorded at the study endpoint.

TI  == molecular cloning of haemoglobin-binding protein hgba in the outer membrane of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.
AB  == from the porcine pathogen actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae cultivated in iron-deficient or haem-deficient media, haemoglobin (hb)-agarose affinity purification was exploited to isolate an outer-membrane protein of approximately  105 kda, designated hgba. internal peptide sequences of purified hgba were used to design oligonucleotide primers for pcr amplification, yielding amplicons that  showed partial sequences with homology to hgba of pasteurella multocida. upon screening two genomic libraries of a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 strain 4074, positive clones were assembled into an orf of 2838 bp. hgba (946 aa) includes a signal peptide of 23 aa and the deduced hgba sequence (104 890 da) also demonstrated a possible ton box. the promoter region of hgba from a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 showed consensus for -35 and -10 sequences and a putative fur-binding site. rt-pcr confirmed that hgba of a. pleuropneumoniae is upregulated in response to diminished levels of iron in the culture medium. while an internally deleted hgba mutant was unable to use pig hb as sole source of iron for growth, flow cytometry confirmed its hb binding; the internally deleted sequences may not be required for hb binding, but appear necessary for the iron supply from hb. hgba is required for growth of a. pleuropneumoniae in the presence of hb as sole iron source.

AB  == the authors studied the bacterial flora of the dog oral cavity and of bite wounds, aerobic bacteria were isolated from mouth swabs of 16 normal and 5 rabid  dogs as well as from infected dog-bite wounds from 18 patients. a total of 20 different microbial species were recovered from mouth swab cultures. the most frequently isolated organisms were klebsiella pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and pasteurella species. there were no differences in the aerobic bacterial flora between rabid and nonrabid dogs. from  the cultures of the bite wound swabs, the authors found that almost all of the organisms identified were part of the normal oral flora of the dog. one or more aerobic bacteria were isolated from the infected dog-bite wounds. two patients had four, 3 had three, 4 had two, and 6 had one of the nine organisms in their wounds. the predominant species of bacteria involved in infection of bite wounds  were, as follows: staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, moraxella species, pasteurella canis, and enterobacter cloacae. however, three wound cultures had no aerobic bacterial growth. the results of this study show that the infected bite wounds may contain a mixed bacterial flora that colonize human skin and the oral cavity of dogs.

TI  == characterization of two lipoproteins in pasteurella multocida.
AB  == an in vivo expression technology (ivet) system was previously developed and used  to identify pasteurella multocida genes, which are upregulated during infection of the host. of the many genes identified, two encoded products which showed similarity to the haemophilus influenzae lipoproteins, protein d and pcp, which have been shown to stimulate heterologous immunity against infection with h. influenzae. therefore, the lipoprotein homologues in p. multocida, designated glpq and pcp, were investigated. glpq and pcp were shown to be lipoproteins by demonstrating that post-translational processing of the proteins was inhibited by globomycin. the p. multocida glpq homologue showed glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase enzyme activity, indicating that it is a functional homologue of other characterized glpq enzymes. using surface immunoprecipitation, pcp was found to be surface exposed, but glpq was not. non-lipidated forms of glpq and pcp were expressed and purified from escherichia coli and used to vaccinate mice. however, mice were not protected from challenge with live p. multocida. the lipoproteins were then expressed in e. coli in the lipidated form and used to vaccinate mice and chickens. protection against challenge with live p. multocida  was not observed.

TI  == molecular characterization of plasmids with antimicrobial resistant genes in avian isolates of pasteurella multocida.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequences of two plasmids from avian isolates of pasteurella multocida that caused outbreaks of fowl cholera in taiwan were determined. the entire sequences of the two plasmids, designated as pjr1 and pjr2, were 6792 bp and 5252 bp. sequence analysis showed that the plasmid pjr1 contained six major genes: the first gene (sulii) encoded a type ii sulfonamide resistant dihydropteroate synthase, the second gene (tetg) encoded a tetracycline resistance protein, the third gene (catb2) encoded a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, the fourth gene (rep) encoded a replication protein, and the fifth and sixth genes (mbecy and deltambeay) encoded proteins involved in the mobilization of plasmid. the plasmid pjr2 contained five major genes: the first gene (deltainti1) encoded a truncated form of a type i integrase, the second gene (aada1) encoded an aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase that confers resistance to  streptomycin and spectinomycin, the third gene (blap1) encoded a beta-lactamase that confers resistance to ampicillin and carbenicillin, and the fourth and fifth genes might encode proteins involved in the plasmid replication or segregation. sequence comparisons showed that the antibiotic resistance genes found in pjr1 and pjr2 exhibited a high degree of sequence homology to the corresponding genes  found in a great variety of gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica typhimurium dt104, psedomonas spp., p. multocida, mannheimia  spp., and actinobacills pleuropneumoniae, which suggests that these resistance genes were disseminated in these bacteria. although sulii and tetg genes were found previously in p. multocida or mannheimia spp., this is the first report on  the presence of catb2, aada1, and blap1 genes in bacteria of the family pasturellaceae. moreover, the aada1 and blap1 genes found in pjr2 were organized  into an integron structure, which is a site-specific recombination system capable of capturing and mobilizing antibiotic resistance genes. this is also the first report on the presence of an integron in bacteria of the family pasteurellaceae.  the presence of a p. multocida integron might facilitate the spreading of antibiotic resistance genes between p. multocida and other gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == pasteurella multocida group b, serotype 3, was isolated from sinusitis-affected khaki campbell ducks. to study the role of p. multocida in sinusitis, commercial  khaki campbell ducks were experimentally infected with p. multocida alone or combined with escherichia coli. in expt. 1, experimental ducks were infected with p. multocida intranasally or ocularly. a comparison was done by intranasal inoculation with pooled nasal discharge from the affected ducks or phosphate-buffered saline. the ducks intranasally inoculated with the nasal discharge or p. multocida showed sinusitis. in expt. 2, e. coli alone or a combination of p. multocida and e. coli was intranasally inoculated into experimental ducks. the ducks intranasally inoculated with the combination of p.  multocida and e. coli had sinusitis, the same as found in the field but less severe than that of the field cases. pasteurella multocida was already present in litter/floor of duck farms. we concluded that p. multocida played a role in induction of sinusitis. however, the sinusitis in ducks may be initiated by poor  management, especially in the brooding period of ducks.

AB  == pasteurella multocida ompa-like gene (pmompa) was cloned and characterized. the mature protein had a molecular mass of 35,075 da and significant similarity with  escherichia coli (e. coli) ompa proteins. membrane topology analyses predict that like e. coli ompa, the n-terminal half of pmompa exists as an eight-stranded transmembrane antiparallel beta-barrel that displays four variable hydrophilic and surface-exposed regions with predicted antigenic peaks that may be involved in serum resistance or adherence. in addition, the ala-pro repeat region between  the n-terminal beta-barrel and c-terminal periplasmic domains is completely missing in pmompa. pmompa was expressed in e. coli and immunoblots analysis revealed that the recombinant pmompa was immunogenic, and expressed in vivo. the  binding of pmompa to biotinylated madin darby bovine kidney (mdbk) cells surface  proteins, fibronectin and heparin was demonstrated. furthermore, pmompa binds mdbk monolayers and pre-treatment of p. multocida whole cells with anti-pmompa significantly reduced adherence to fibronectin. ligand blot analysis revealed that fibronectin binds to the native and heat modified forms of pmompa when heated at 37 and 100 degrees c, respectively. collectively these data indicate that pmompa may be involved in p. multocida 232 adherence to host cells via heparin and/or fibronectin bridging.

TI  == alteration of dna adenine methylase (dam) activity in pasteurella multocida causes increased spontaneous mutation frequency and attenuation in mice.
AB  == pasteurella multocida is one of the primary bacterial pathogens associated with bovine respiratory disease (brd) complex. relatively few virulence factors of p.  multocida have been characterized, and there is a need for improved vaccines for  prevention of brd. in other gram-negative species, dna adenine methylase (dam) regulates the expression of virulence genes, and appropriate expression of dam is required for virulence. in this study, the authors cloned and sequenced the p. multocida a1 dam gene and demonstrated that it is able to restore dam function in an escherichia coli dam mutant. when p. multocida dam was placed under the control of a constitutively expressed promoter on a plasmid, it caused an increased spontaneous mutation rate in p. multocida. in addition, the plasmid-mediated alteration of dam production in p. multocida caused it to be highly attenuated in mice. these findings indicate that appropriate expression of dam is required for virulence of p. multocida, which is believed to be the first  report that dam is required for virulence of a species in the pasteurellaceae. therefore, dam may function as a virulence gene regulator in the pasteurellaceae, similar to previously reported findings from other gram-negative species.

TI  == fur-independent regulation of the pasteurella multocida hbpa gene encoding a haemin-binding protein.
AB  == treatment of bacterial cultures with chelating agents such as 2,2'-dipyridyl (dpd) induces expression of iron-regulated genes. it is known that in the gamma-proteobacteria, the fur protein is the major regulator of genes encoding haem- or haemoglobin-binding proteins. electrophoretic analysis of outer-membrane proteins of the gamma-proteobacterium pasteurella multocida has revealed the induction of two proteins of 60 and 40 kda in dpd-treated cultures in both wild-type and fur-defective strains. these two proteins have the same n-terminal  amino acid sequence, which identifies this protein as the product of the pm0592 orf. analysis of the sequence of this orf, which encodes a protein of 60 kda, revealed the presence of a hexanucleotide (aaaaaa) at which a programmed translational frameshift can occur giving rise to a 40 kda protein. analyses conducted in escherichia coli, using the complete pm0592 orf and a derivative truncated at the hexanucleotide position, have shown that both polypeptides bind  haemin. for this reason, the pm0592 orf product has been designated hbpa (for haemin-binding protein). expression studies using both rt-pcr and lacz fusions, as well as electrophoretic profiles of outer-membrane protein composition, have demonstrated that the hbpa gene is negatively regulated by iron, manganese and haemin through a fur-independent pathway. despite the fact that serum of mice infected with p. multocida contained antibodies that reacted with both the 60 and 40 kda products of the hbpa gene, these proteins did not offer protection when used in immunization assays against this micro-organism.

TI  == construction and evaluation of a plasmid vector for the expression of recombinant lipoproteins in escherichia coli.
AB  == outer membrane lipoproteins are emerging as key targets for protective immunity to many bacterial pathogens. heterologous expression of lipoproteins in escherichia coli does not always result in high level expression of acylated recombinant protein. thus, these proteins do not take up their correct membrane topology and are lacking the immunostimulatory properties endowed by the lipid. to this end, we have designed a lipoprotein expression vector (pdump) that results in the production of fusion proteins containing the e. coli major outer membrane lipoprotein (lpp) signal sequence, lipoprotein signal peptidase recognition site, and the +2 outer membrane sorting signal at their n termini. to test the ability of pdump to express lipoproteins from heterologous hosts, the surface lipoprotein psaa from the gram-positive organism streptococcus pneumoniae and the outer membrane lipoproteins mlpa from the gram-negative pasteurella multocida and blpa from the spirochete brachyspira hyodysenteriae were cloned into both hexahistidine fusion vectors and pdump. high level expression of antigenically active protein from both the hexahistidine fusion vectors and pdump resulted in abundant bands of the predicted molecular masses when analyzed by sds-page. when grown in the presence of 3[h]palmitic acid, proteins encoded by pdump were observed to incorporate palmitic acid whilst the hexahistidine fusion  proteins did not. using mass spectrometry and image analysis we determined the efficiency of lipidation between the three clones to vary from 31.7 to 100%. in addition, lipidated, but not hexahistidine, forms of the proteins were presented  on the e. coli surface.

TI  == [purine regulon of gamma-proteobacteria: a detailed description].

AB  == reverse transcriptase pcr analyses have demonstrated that open reading frames (orfs) pm0298, pm0299, and pm0300 of the animal pathogen pasteurella multocida constitute a single transcriptional unit. by cloning and overexpression studies in escherichia coli cells, the product of orf pm0300 was shown to bind hemoglobin in vitro; this orf was therefore designated hgba. in vitro and in vivo quantitative assays demonstrated that the p. multocida hgba mutant bound hemoglobin to the same extent as the wild-type strain, although the adsorption kinetics was slightly slower for the hgba cells. in agreement with this, the virulence of p. multocida hgba cells was not affected, suggesting that other functional hemoglobin receptor proteins must be present in this organism. on the  other hand, p. multocida mutants defective in pm0298 and pm0299 could be isolated only when a plasmid containing an intact copy of the gene was present in the cells, suggesting that these genes are essential for the viability of this bacterial pathogen. by adapting the recombinase-based expression technology in vivo to p. multocida, we also demonstrated that the transcriptional pm0298-pm0299-hgba unit is iron regulated and that its expression is triggered in the first 2 h following infection in a mouse model. furthermore, hybridization experiments showed that the hgba gene is widespread in p. multocida strains regardless of their serotype or the animal from which they were isolated.

AB  == during the months of november 1996, august 1997, and march 1998, saliva and plasma samples were collected for isolation of aerobic bacteria from 26 wild and  13 captive komodo dragons (varanus komodoensis). twenty-eight gram-negative and 29 gram-positive species of bacteria were isolated from the saliva of the 39 komodo dragons. a greater number of wild than captive dragons were positive for both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. the average number of bacterial species within the saliva of wild dragons was 46% greater than for captive dragons. while escherichia coli was the most common bacterium isolated from the saliva of wild dragons, this species was not present in captive dragons. the most common bacteria isolated from the saliva of captive dragons were staphylococcus capitis and staphylococcus capitis and staphylococcus caseolyticus, neither of which were found in wild dragons. high mortality was seen among mice injected with saliva from wild dragons and the only bacterium isolated from the blood of dying mice was pasteurella multocida. a competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed the presence of anti-pasteurella antibody in the plasma of komodo dragons. four species of bacteria isolated from dragon saliva showed resistance to one or more of 16 antimicrobics tested. the wide variety of  bacteria demonstrated in the saliva of the komodo dragon in this study, at least  one species of which was highly lethal in mice and 54 species of which are known  pathogens, support the observation that wounds inflicted by this animal are often associated with sepsis and subsequent bacteremia in prey animals.

AB  == the stereoselective synthesis of two novel series of tribasic macrocyclic antibiotics with potent in vitro activity against pasteurella multocida and escherichia coli strains of bacteria is described. the in vitro activity can be significantly influenced by the nature of the substituents on the c-4" aminoalcohol, with the stereochemistry of the c-4" alcohol playing a less critical role. the effect of substitution and stereochemistry on the in vivo activity in a murine model of respiratory infection is also described.

TI  == antigenic relationships within the genus salmonella as revealed by anti-salmonella enteritidis monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == a panel of 38 monoclonal antibodies (mabs) that react with outer membrane proteins (omps) of salmonella enteritidis was produced. on the basis of their binding pattern in elisa, the mabs were divided into three groups. the first group, consisting of 15 mabs, was found to be salmonella-specific as they did not cross-react with escherichia coli or pasteurella multocida. the second group of 15 mabs cross-reacted with e. coli but not with p. multocida, reflecting the closer antigenic relationship of e. coli with salmonella. the third group of 8 mabs cross-reacted with both e. coli and p. multocida, indicating that the antigenic determinants identified by these mabs are conserved in all the three genera. the antigenic relationship of the salmonella serovars (s. enteritidis, s. gallinarum, s. typhimurium, s. dublin, s. agona, s. indiana and s. choleraesuis)  was studied using omps prepared from them and the anti-s. enteritidis mabs. three mabs appeared to be specific for s. enteritidis as they did not cross-react with  any of the other salmonella serovars. twelve of the 38 mabs cross-reacted with all the serovars tested. six of these were specific to the salmonella genus as they did not cross-react with any of the other gram-negative bacteria tested. the reactivity pattern of the other mabs indicated that s. gallinarum was antigenically close to s. enteritidis, followed in order by s. dublin, s. agona,  s. typhimurium and s. indiana, whereas s. choleraesuis seemed to be antigenically quite distant from s. enteritidis.

TI  == how bacteria could cause cancer: one step at a time.
AB  == helicobacter pylori highlighted the potential for bacteria to cause cancer. it is becoming clear that chronic infection with other bacteria, notably salmonella typhi, can also facilitate tumour development. infections caused by several bacteria (e.g. bartonella spp., lawsonia intracellularis and citrobacter rodentium) can induce cellular proliferation that can be reversed by antibiotic treatment. other chronic bacterial infections have the effect of blocking apoptosis. however, the underlying cellular mechanisms are far from clear. conversely, several bacterial toxins interfere with cellular signalling mechanisms in a way that is characteristic of tumour promoters. these include pasteurella multocida toxin, which uniquely acts as a mitogen, and escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor, which activates rho family signalling. this leads to activation of cox2, which is involved in several stages of tumour development, including inhibition of apoptosis. such toxins could provide valuable models for bacterial involvement in cancer, but more significantly they  could play a direct role in cancer causation and progression.

AB  == the exbb, exbd and tonb genes of the pasteurella multocida animal pathogen have been cloned by complementation of an escherichia coli tonb mutant. despite these  three genes being physically linked, rt-pcr analysis, lacz transcriptional fusions and construction of insertional mutants have demonstrated that they do not constitute an operon, but rather are transcribed independently from each other. furthermore, expression of these three genes is under iron control as revealed by lacz fusions and fur titration assay analysis. moreover, each of these three genes is necessary for the virulence of p. multocida cells and all of them contribute equally to the infectious process of this microorganism.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == molecular cloning and characterization of chondroitin polymerase from escherichia coli strain k4.
AB  == escherichia coli strain k4 produces the k4 antigen, a capsule polysaccharide consisting of a chondroitin backbone (glcua beta(1-3)-galnac beta(1-4))(n) to which beta-fructose is linked at position c-3 of the glcua residue. we molecularly cloned region 2 of the k4 capsular gene cluster essential for biosynthesis of the polysaccharide, and we further identified a gene encoding a bifunctional glycosyltransferase that polymerizes the chondroitin backbone. the enzyme, containing two conserved glycosyltransferase sites, showed 59 and 61% identity at the amino acid level to class 2 hyaluronan synthase and chondroitin synthase from pasteurella multocida, respectively. the soluble enzyme expressed in a bacterial expression system transferred galnac and glcua residues alternately, and polymerized the chondroitin chain up to a molecular mass of 20 kda when chondroitin sulfate hexasaccharide was used as an acceptor. the enzyme exhibited apparent k(m) values for udp-glcua and udp-galnac of 3.44 and 31.6 microm, respectively, and absolutely required acceptors of chondroitin sulfate polymers and oligosaccharides at least longer than a tetrasaccharide. in addition, chondroitin polymers and oligosaccharides and hyaluronan polymers and oligosaccharides served as acceptors for chondroitin polymerization, but dermatan sulfate and heparin did not. these results may lead to elucidation of the mechanism for chondroitin chain synthesis in both microorganisms and mammals.

TI  == studies on the production of quorum-sensing signal molecules in mannheimia haemolytica a1 and other pasteurellaceae species.
AB  == the bioluminescence assay system using vibrio harveyi reporter strains were used  to examine quorum-sensing autoinducer (ai) activity from mannheimia haemolytica a1 cell-free culture supernatant. we showed that m. haemolytica a1 cell-free culture supernatant contains molecules that can stimulate the quorum-sensing system that regulates the expression of the luciferase operon in v. harveyi. specifically, m. haemolytica a1 can stimulate only the quorum system 2 but not system 1, suggesting that the culture supernatant only contains molecules similar to ai-2 of v. harveyi. the bioluminescence assay was also used to show that culture supernatants from related pasteurellaceae organisms, pasteurella multocida, pasteurella trehalosi, actinobacillus suis and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, also contain ai-2-like molecules. this is consistent with the presence of a luxs homolog in the genomes of p. multocida and a. pleuropneumoniae. a luxs homolog was cloned by pcr from m. haemolytica a1 using sequencing data from the ongoing genome sequencing project. the cloned luxs(m.h.) was able to complement ai-2 production in the escherichia coli dh5alpha luxs mutant. this is the first report of a quorum-sensing activity in m. haemolytica a1 and suggests that this bacterium utilizes this mechanism to regulate expression of genes under specific conditions.

TI  == identification and molecular cloning of a heparosan synthase from pasteurella multocida type d.
AB  == pasteurella multocida type d, a causative agent of atrophic rhinitis in swine and pasteurellosis in other domestic animals, produces an extracellular polysaccharide capsule that is a putative virulence factor. it was reported previously that the capsule was removed by treating microbes with heparin lyase iii. we molecularly cloned a 617-residue enzyme, pmhs, which is a heparosan (nonsulfated, unepimerized heparin) synthase. recombinant escherichia coli-derived pmhs catalyzes the polymerization of the monosaccharides from udp-glcnac and udp-glcua. other structurally related sugar nucleotides did not substitute. synthase activity was stimulated about 7-25-fold by the addition of an exogenous polymer acceptor. molecules composed of approximately 500-3,000 sugar residues were produced in vitro. the polysaccharide was sensitive to the action of heparin lyase iii but resistant to hyaluronan lyase. the sequence of the pmhs enzyme is not very similar to the vertebrate heparin/heparan sulfate glycosyltransferases, ext1 and 2, or to other pasteurella glycosaminoglycan synthases that produce hyaluronan or chondroitin. the pmhs enzyme is the first microbial dual-action glycosyltransferase to be described that forms a polysaccharide composed of beta4glcua-alpha4glcnac disaccharide repeats. in contrast, heparosan biosynthesis in e. coli k5 requires at least two separate polypeptides, kfia and kfic, to catalyze the same polymerization reaction.

TI  == [the current antimicrobial resistance situation in swiss veterinary medicine].
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility data (n = 1501) and bacterial isolates (n = 258) of  important bacterial pathogens from animals were collected in collaboration with eight swiss laboratories from may 1999 to february 2000. using these data, the antimicrobial resistance situation could be assessed for the following bacterial  species: escherichia coli, salmonella, haemophilus parasuis, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, bordetella bronchiseptica, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus intermedius, streptococci, and enterococci. differences in the distribution of resistance between animal species could be evidenced in e. coli and salmonella. some resistance frequency data were compared with those obtained in 1980. a significant increase of resistance frequency was observed for several antibiotics. this includes in particular an increase of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole resistance in e. coli. a similar increase was observed in salmonella for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and nalidixic  acid. staphylococci from dogs (s. intermedius and s. aureus) also presented a clear increase of resistance for penicillin, neomycin, sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole, and erythromycin. finally, a comparison with data from abroad shows that the antibiotic resistance situation in switzerland is relatively favorable.

TI  == bacteremia associated with naturally occuring acute coliform mastitis in dairy cows.
AB  == objective: to determine the incidence of bacteremia in dairy cows with naturally  occurring acute coliform mastitis (acm) with a wide range of disease severity. design: cohort study. animals: 144 dairy cows with acm from 6 herds. procedure: cows were examined at time of identification of acm (time 0) and classified as having mild, moderate, or severe mastitis on the basis of rectal temperature, hydration status, rumen contraction rate, and attitude. cows were reexamined at 24 or 48 hours. bacteriologic culturing of milk and blood (30 ml), cbc, and serum biochemical analysis were performed at each time point. appropriate samples were  obtained at a single point from herdmates without mastitis (controls) that were closely matched for lactation number and days since parturition. blood culture results were compared among severity groups and controls by use of chi2 tests, as was outcome of an acm episode for cows grouped by blood bacterial isolates. results: bacteria were isolated from 52 blood samples from 46 of 144 (32%) cows with acm, which was significantly more than control cows (11/156; 7.1%). group-1  isolates (escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium) were identified in 20 of 144 (14%) cows with acm and 0 of 156 control cows. group-1 isolates were identified in 4.3, 9.1, and 42% of cows classified as having mild, moderate, and severe acm, respectively. escherichia coli and k pneumoniae milk and blood isolates obtained from the same cow were of  the same genotype. bacillus spp were identified in 21 of 144 (15%) cows with acm, which was significantly more than control cows (3/156; 1.9%). thirty-five percent of cows with a group-1 isolate died during the mastitis episode. conclusions and  clinical relevance: results suggest that bacteremia develops in a substantial proportion of cows with acm. classification of severity of disease is important for establishment of effective treatment protocols; parenteral antimicrobial treatment may be indicated in cows with acm.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction to identify brucella abortus strain rb51 among brucella field isolates from cattle in italy.
AB  == brucella abortus strain rb51, a rough mutant of the b. abortus 2308 virulent strain, was recently approved in the united states as the official vaccine for brucellosis in cattle. following recent evidence of unauthorized use of rb51 vaccine in italy, where the use of vaccines for brucellosis is no longer allowed, the suitability of an rb51-specific polymerase chain reaction assay for identifying the rb51 strain among brucella field isolates from cattle in italy was investigated. the oligonucleotide primers used in this study, belonging to a  six-primer cocktail for brucella species previously described by other authors, allowed the amplification of a 364-base pair (bp) fragment specific for rb51 and  its parent strain 2308, and a 498-bp product specific for b. abortus. in addition, unresolved bands ranging from 600 to 700 bp were observed from rb51 strain. brucella abortus biovars 1, 2 and 4 have only one specific sensitive 498-bp band. the b. abortus biovars 3, 5 and 6 did not give any signal. the 498-bp product from a reference brucella strain was sequenced and submitted to embl with the accession number aj271969 while the 364-bp fragment from rb51 strain was submitted to embl database with accession number aj271968. the sequence studies confirmed the specificity of the detected fragments. no amplification was obtained by testing dna from strains antigenically related to brucella, such as yersinia enterocolitica o:9, escherichia coli o:157, salmonella urbana and pasteurella multocida. the results of this study indicate that this technique, in combination with specific serological tests, could be a useful diagnostic method to verify the use of rb51 vaccine and can contribute to the creation of a databank of circulating strains.

TI  == virulence of pasteurella multocida reca mutants.
AB  == in order to determine the role of the reca protein in the virulence of pasteurella multocida, a reca mutant was constructed and used in studies of virulence and competition in relation to wild-type strain. to achieve this, firstly, the reca gene was isolated and sequenced, showing an escherichia coli-like sos box and encoding a protein of 354 amino acids which has the closest identity with the haemophilus influenzae reca protein. further, the reca mutant was constructed, by inactivating this gene by single recombination of a suicide plasmid containing an internal region of the p. multocida reca gene, and shown to be more sensitive to uv radiation than the parental strain. the p. multocida mutant was slightly attenuated in virulence, as indicated by the ld(50), the time of death of infected animals, and a failure to compete with the wild-type strain  in mixed infections. compared to the parent strain, the mutant had a similar growth rate but a longer lag phase. these data suggest that the diminished virulence of the reca mutant as well as its failure in competition were more a consequence of the long lag phase rather than a direct effect of the inactivation of the reca gene on genes involved in virulence.

TI  == identification of a plasmid-encoded gene from haemophilus ducreyi which confers nad independence.
AB  == members of the family pasteurellaceae are classified in part by whether or not they require an nad supplement for growth on laboratory media. in this study, we  demonstrate that this phenotype can be determined by a single gene, nadv, whose presence allows nad-independent growth of haemophilus influenzae and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. this gene was cloned from a 5.2-kb plasmid which was previously shown to be responsible for nad independence in haemophilus ducreyi. when transformed into a. pleuropneumoniae, this cloned gene allowed nad-independent growth on complex media and allowed the utilization of nicotinamide in place of nad on defined media. sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,482 bp that is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular  mass of 55,619 da. compared with the sequence databases, nadv was found to have significant sequence homology to the human pre-b-cell colony-enhancing factor pbef and to predicted proteins of unknown function identified in the bacterial species mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma pneumoniae, shewanella putrefaciens, synechocystis sp., deinococcus radiodurans, pasteurella multocida, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. p. multocida and a. actinomycetemcomitans are among the nad-independent members of the pasteurellaceae. homologues of nadv  were not found in the sequenced genome of h. influenzae, an nad-dependent member  of the pasteurellaceae, or in species known to utilize a different pathway for synthesis of nad, such as escherichia coli. sequence alignment of these nine homologues revealed regions and residues of complete conservation that may be directly involved in the enzymatic activity. identification of a function for this gene in the pasteurellaceae should help to elucidate the role of its homologues in other species.

TI  == cloning and characterization of sialidases with 2-6' and 2-3' sialyl lactose specificity from pasteurella multocida.
AB  == pasteurella multocida is a mucosal pathogen that colonizes the respiratory system of susceptible hosts. most isolates of p. multocida produce sialidase activity, which may contribute to colonization of the respiratory tract or the production of lesions in an active infection. we have cloned and sequenced a sialidase gene, nanh, from a fowl cholera isolate of p. multocida. sequence analysis of nanh revealed that it exhibited significant amino acid sequence homology with many microbial sialidases. insertional inactivation of nanh resulted in a mutant strain that was not deficient in sialidase production. however, this mutant exhibited reduced enzyme activity and growth rate on 2-3' sialyl lactose compared to the wild type. subsequently, we demonstrated the presence of two sialidases by cloning another sialidase gene that differed from nanh in dna sequence and substrate specificity. nanb demonstrated activity on both 2-3' and 2-6' sialyl lactose, while nanh demonstrated activity only on 2-3' sialyl lactose. neither enzyme liberated sialic acid from colominic acid (2-8' sialyl lactose). recombinant e. coli containing the sialidase genes were able to utilize several sialoconjugants when they were provided as sole carbon sources in minimal medium. these data suggest that sialidases have a nutritional function and may contribute to the ability of p. multocida to colonize and persist on vertebrate mucosal surfaces.

AB  == duck enteritis virus (dev) was isolated from commercial 2-to-6-wk-old white pekin ducks experiencing 25%-30% mortality and high morbidity. secondary infections with pasteurella multocida, riemerella anatipestifer, and escherichia coli were frequently seen in affected ducks. the isolated virus was identical to the prototype dev by virus neutralization test but differed from the classic dev by causing lymphoid organ atrophy and inconsistent hemorrhagic lesions in the intestinal annular bands. attempts to reproduce the disease in white pekin ducks  were unsuccessful until the virulence of the virus was increased by three passages in muscovy ducklings. significant thymic atrophy (p < or = 0.001) was detected during the first 10 days postinfection (dpi), but thymus size returned to normal by 17-24 dpi. however, bursal atrophy increased significantly (p < or = 0.001) from 4 dpi until the end of the experiment (39 dpi). reduction in body weight was significant (p < or = 0.05) between 4 and 6 dpi. there was massive depletion of thymic and bursal lymphocytes with lymphoid necrosis in the thymus,  bursa, spleen, and harderian gland. eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions were observed in thymus, bursa, spleen, esophagus, cloaca, liver, conjunctiva, and harderian gland. occasional intracytoplasmic inclusions were also found scattered in the epithelial cells of conjunctiva, esophagus, bursa of fabricius, and cloaca. virus was recovered from experimentally infected ducks from thymus, bursa, spleen, liver, kidneys, trigeminal ganglion, and cloaca during the first 10 days of infection. these findings suggest that a low-virulent dev can cause a  massive lymphoid atrophy and can sustain immunosuppression as noted by the secondary bacterial infection.

TI  == identification of a truncated, but functionally active tet(h) tetracycline resistance gene in pasteurella aerogenes and pasteurella multocida.
AB  == molecular analysis of pasteurella isolates of animal origin for plasmid-encoded tetracycline resistance genes identified a common tet(h)-carrying plasmid of 5.5  kbp in a single isolate of pasteurella aerogenes and six isolates of pasteurella  multocida. this plasmid carried a truncated tn5706 element in which one of the is elements, is1596, was lost completely and of the other, is1597, only a relic of 84 bp was left. sequencing of the resistance gene region and the flanking areas revealed the presence of a deletion in the 3' end of the tet(h) gene which shortened the tet(h) reading frame by 24 bp. the amino acid sequence of the respective teth protein comprised only 392 amino acids. despite this deletion, the tet(h) gene conferred high level tetracycline resistance not only to the original pasteurella isolates but also to the respective escherichia coli jm107 and c600 transformants as confirmed by mic determination. the deletion was probably the result from recombinational events. two possible recombination sites involved in the deletion of tet(h) and that of is1597 were identified. macrorestriction analysis of the pasteurella isolates carrying plasmid ppat1 confirmed horizontal and vertical transfer of this plasmid.

TI  == induction of parturition with prostaglandin f2 alpha as a possible model to study impaired reproductive performance in the dairy cow.
AB  == parturitions were induced in five cows, 2 weeks before term using prostaglandin (pg) f(2alpha). two i.m. injections were performed with an interval of 24 h. all  cows calved within 5 days (average 2.7 days) after the first injection of pgf(2alpha). out of five cows, four had retained fetal membranes (rfm). each animal was sampled for bacteriological examination using uterine biopsies twice a week during 42 days postpartum (pp). jugular vein blood samples were withdrawn for pgf(2alpha)-metabolite and progesterone analyses five times per day during the first week pp and eight times per 24 h during the 2nd and 3rd weeks pp. from  the 4th week, the sampling interval was reduced back to five times per day. from  the 5th week pp, the sampling was reduced to two times per day and sampling was terminated after day 46 pp. only morning samples were used for progesterone analyses. from day 10 pp, ultrasonography (us) was performed every 3rd day until  day 39 pp for detection of ovarian activity and follicular dynamics. the highest  incidence of bacteriological species was found during the first 3 weeks pp. after the 5th week of collection, all animals were free from bacteria. the species of bacteria found were arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, escherichia coli, alpha-hemolytic streptococcae and pasteurella multocida. immediately after parturition, very high levels of the pg-metabolite were seen in all animals, with a sharp decrease to line of significance around days 9-12 pp. small increases above the line of significance were detected up to day 27 pp in cows with rfm, and after that time the levels were considered to be at baseline. low levels of progesterone were seen in four animals during the whole experimental time. in one animal, an increase was seen on day 43 pp, which was maintained until the end of  the experimental period on day 46 pp. based on us, follicular waves were detected in all animals during the experimental period. in three animals, three non-ovulatory follicular waves were detected and in two animals, four non-ovulatory follicular waves were detected during 39 days of ultrasound sessions. based on progesterone levels, only one animal was considered to have ovulated around day 40 pp. results from the present study indicate that reproductive performance of cows after pg-induced parturitions differs from those of spontaneous cases of rfm. differences regarding the resumption of ovarian activity were also observed between previous studies of dexamethasone-induced parturitions and the present study.

TI  == identification and molecular cloning of a chondroitin synthase from pasteurella multocida type f.
AB  == pasteurella multocida type f, the minor fowl cholera pathogen, produces an extracellular polysaccharide capsule that is a putative virulence factor. it was  reported that the capsule was removed by treating microbes with chondroitin ac lyase. we found by acid hydrolysis that the polysaccharide contained galactosamine and glucuronic acid. we molecularly cloned a type f polysaccharide  synthase and characterized its enzymatic activity. the 965-residue enzyme, called p. multocida chondroitin synthase (pmcs), is 87% identical at the nucleotide and  the amino acid level to the hyaluronan synthase, pmhas, from p. multocida type a. a recombinant escherichia coli-derived truncated, soluble version of pmcs (residues 1-704) was shown to catalyze the repetitive addition of sugars from udp-galnac and udp-glcua to chondroitin oligosaccharide acceptors in vitro. other structurally related sugar nucleotide precursors did not substitute in the elongation reaction. polymer molecules composed of approximately 10(3) sugar residues were produced, as measured by gel filtration chromatography. the polysaccharide synthesized in vitro was sensitive to the action of chondroitin ac lyase but resistant to the action of hyaluronan lyase. this is the first report identifying a glycosyltransferase that forms a polysaccharide composed of chondroitin disaccharide repeats, [beta(1,4)glcua-beta(1,3)galnac](n). in analogy to known hyaluronan synthases, a single polypeptide species, pmcs, possesses both transferase activities.

TI  == a 24-kda cloned zinc metalloprotease from actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is common to all serotypes and cleaves actin in vitro.
AB  == actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae causes pleuropneumonia in swine. this bacterium secretes proteases that degrade porcine hemoglobin and iga in vitro. to further characterize a. pleuropneumoniae proteases, we constructed a genomic library expressed in escherichia coli dh5alpha, and selected a clone that showed proteolytic activity. the recombinant plasmid carries an 800-base pair a. pleuropneumoniae gene sequence that.codes for a 24-kda polypeptide. a 350-base pair psti fragment from the sequence hybridized at high stringency with dna from  12 serotypes of a. pleuropneumoniae, but not with dna from actinobacillus suis, haemophilus parasuis, pasteurella haemolytica, pasteurella multocida a or d, or e. coli dh5alpha, thus showing specificity for a. pleuropneumoniae. the expressed polypeptide was recognized as an antigen by convalescent-phase pig sera. furthermore, a polyclonal antiserum developed against the purified polypeptide recognized an a. pleuropneumoniae oligomeric protein in both crude-extract and cell-free culture media. this recombinant polypeptide cleaved azocoll, gelatin, and actin. inhibition of the proteolytic activity by diethylpyrocarbonate suggests that this polypeptide is a zinc metalloprotease.

TI  == nonspecific cellular defense of the avian respiratory system: a review.
AB  == the normal, steady-state, avian respiratory system has very low numbers of residing avian respiratory phagocytes (arp). birds must rely heavily on the influx of arp to defend against infectious agents. the system is refractory to elicitation by inert stimulants, but responds efficiently to replicating bacteria, with very rapid influx of large numbers of activated arp (polymorphonuclear neutrophils, heterophils, and macrophages) with increased phagocytic proportions and capacities. the numbers subside within a few a days. activated arp act in a non agent-specific manner: pasteurella multocida-activated arp can defend against a severe escherichia coli airsacculitis. parenteral routes of stimulation generally are not, respiratory routes are very, efficient in activating arp. heterophils are the most efficient in defensive reactions, such as oxidative burst, production of nitric oxide and killing of bacteria. respiratory viruses may stimulate, but also may diminish some of the defensive functions of arp. this is also true for attenuated, modified live virus vaccines. these vaccines must be used carefully in the presence of subclinical bacterial, mycoplasmal infections. published literature on non-specific cellular defense of  the avian respiratory system is very limited, particularly about interactions among multiple infectious agents and the system.

AB  == sixty-six rabbits, with no history of vaccination against myxomatosis and which had died of pulmonary lesions, were submitted for virological and serological tests for myxoma virus (mv) infection and for bacteriological examinations. at post mortem, the diagnoses based on observed lesions were as follows: acute haemorrhagic pneumonia (38%); acute suppurative bronchopneumonia (35%); and fibrinohaemorrhagic bronchopneumonia with fibrinous pleuritis (27%). mv was isolated from 10% of the rabbits, mainly from those with acute haemorrhagic pneumonia. serological evidence of mv infection was demonstrated in 44% of rabbits. pathogenic bacteria species isolated from lungs were pasteurella (spp. and multocida), escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica and pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively, from 41, 11, 7 and 6% of samples. no relationship could be established between the presence of specific antibodies to mv and the observed pulmonary lesions or the results of the bacteriological examinations. a significant trend was established between the severity of the lesions and the results of the bacteriological examinations.

TI  == survival of avian strains of pasteurella multocida in chicken serum.
AB  == the ability of bacteria to survive in serum is considered a likely virulence determinant in diseases where the infective bacteria become septicaemic. optimal  conditions were established to test the survival of pasteurella multocida in chicken serum. serum was used at 90%, the inoculum was 10(3)-10(4)cfu in phosphate buffered saline ph 7.4. survival was measured after incubation for 2-4  h; if survival was <50% the strain was considered serum susceptible. susceptible  strains were either killed or their growth was inhibited. some resistant strains  not only survived but grew rapidly in unheated serum. thirty-five strains, all originally isolated from clinical fowl cholera, were tested; eight were susceptible, of which three were killed and five inhibited, and the remainder (27) were resistant. ten serum-resistant p. multocida serogroup a strains were grown in hyaluronidase to remove the capsule and survival in chicken serum was re-tested. three strains became susceptible, while seven strains remained resistant. three serum susceptible strains were then tested in the presence of cytidine monophosphate-n-acetylneuraminic acid (cmp-nana). this substance is present in the human serum, and is known to mask the effect of complement on neisseria gonorrhoeae rendering susceptible strains resistant. two of the three serum susceptible strains became resistant in the presence of cmp-nana. serum susceptibility/resistance was more complex than that of escherichia coli, and the role of resistance to avian complement in the pathogenesis of fowl cholera remains to be determined.

TI  == cloning and characterisation of the pasteurella multocida ahpa gene responsible for a haemolytic phenotype in escherichia coli.
AB  == haemolysins are membrane-damaging agents which have been described as bacterial virulence factors due to their ability to lyse erythrocytes and other host cells, and therefore inducing a greater inflammatory response (elliott et al., 1998). pasteurella multocida was found to be haemolytic under anaerobic conditions. in this study, we cloned and characterised a p. multocida gene, designated ahpa, which conferred a haemolytic phenotype on escherichia coli when incubated under anaerobic conditions. a deletion was introduced into the ahpa open reading frame  which abolished the haemolytic phenotype. the clone containing ahpa showed erythrocyte specificity, causing haemolysis of bovine and equine erythrocytes, and demonstrated weak haemolysis on ovine erythrocytes. upon further investigation, ahpa was found to affect the expression of the e. coli k-12 latent haemolysin, shea, under anaerobic conditions.

TI  == the risk of nosocomial pneumonia is not increased during partial liquid ventilation.
AB  == objective: to determine whether partial liquid ventilation (plv) affects the risk of nosocomial pneumonia. study design: to assess in vitro bacterial adhesion and  viability after liquid perfluorocarbon exposure and to assess bacterial recovery  after partial liquid ventilation in vivo in rabbits. setting: university animal research facility. subjects: thirty-six new zealand white rabbits. interventions: to assess adhesions, radiolabeled escherichia coli were exposed to perfluorocarbon, incubated against artificial biosurfaces, and compared with nonexposed controls. bacterial viability in vitro was assessed by exposing broth  suspensions of pasteurella multocida to perflubron for various times. controls were run in parallel without exposure. quantitative cultures were performed to determine viability. we undertook short-term and recovery in vivo investigations. the lungs of treated animals were filled with perflubron (approximately 18 ml/kg), and the control rabbits were ventilated without perflubron in an identical fashion. cryopreserved aliquots of p. multocida were administered via an endotracheal tube. the short-term study animals were ventilated for 6 hrs before being killed. the recovery animals were ventilated for 2-4 hrs, extubated, and killed 20 hrs later. the lungs were removed, aseptically minced, and homogenized. serial dilutions of the homogenate were quantitatively cultured by manual counting of colonies on agar plates. the recovered organisms were typed for species by the clinical microbiology laboratory. measurements and main results: the adhesion of bacteria to immobilized bronchoalveolar lavage and human saliva, respectively, was reduced by 65%+/-7% and 66%+/-1% (p < .05; n = 5) after exposure to perflubron and by 63%+/-9% and 68%+/-6% after exposure to fc-77 (p <  .05; n = 5); however, adhesion was not affected by exposure to rimar. there was no difference in bacterial viability between the control and perflubron-exposed bacteria (n = 5). the in vivo study demonstrated a ten-fold or greater reduction  in the number of recovered bacteria in the partial liquid ventilated group compared with the control group. conclusions: this study suggests that different  perfluorocarbons affect adhesions differently. perflubron and fc-77 appear to decrease bacterial adhesion, whereas rimar does not. rerflubron does not have a direct bactericidal effect. furthermore, plv with perflubron decreased the number of viable bacteria per gram of tissue after an intentional inoculation of the airway, suggesting that the risk of nosocomial pneumonia is unlikely to be increased during plv and may, in fact, be reduced in patients supported with plv.

TI  == bacterial phylogenetic clusters revealed by genome structure.
AB  == current bacterial taxonomy is mostly based on phenotypic criteria, which may yield misleading interpretations in classification and identification. as a result, bacteria not closely related may be grouped together as a genus or species. for pathogenic bacteria, incorrect classification or misidentification could be disastrous. there is therefore an urgent need for appropriate methodologies to classify bacteria according to phylogeny and corresponding new approaches that permit their rapid and accurate identification. for this purpose, we have devised a strategy enabling us to resolve phylogenetic clusters of bacteria by comparing their genome structures. these structures were revealed by  cleaving genomic dna with the endonuclease i-ceui, which cuts within the 23s ribosomal dna (rdna) sequences, and by mapping the resulting large dna fragments  with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. we tested this experimental system on two  representative bacterial genera: salmonella and pasteurella. among salmonella spp., i-ceui mapping revealed virtually indistinguishable genome structures, demonstrating a high degree of structural conservation. consistent with this, 16s rdna sequences are also highly conserved among the salmonella spp. in marked contrast, the pasteurella strains have very different genome structures among and even within individual species. the divergence of pasteurella was also reflected  in 16s rdna sequences and far exceeded that seen between escherichia and salmonella. based on this diversity, the pasteurella haemolytica strains we analyzed could be divided into 14 phylogenetic groups and the pasteurella multocida strains could be divided into 9 groups. if criteria for defining bacterial species or genera similar to those used for salmonella and escherichia  coli were applied, the striking phylogenetic diversity would allow bacteria in the currently recognized species of p. multocida and p. haemolytica to be divided into different species, genera, or even higher ranks. on the other hand, strains  of pasteurella ureae and pasteurella pneumotropica are very similar to those of p. multocida in both genome structure and 16s rdna sequence and should be regarded as strains within this species. we conclude that large-scale genome structure can be a sensitive indicator of phylogenetic relationships and that, therefore, i-ceui-based genomic mapping is an efficient tool for probing the phylogenetic status of bacteria.

TI  == 31p and 13c nuclear magnetic resonance studies of metabolic pathways in pasteurella multocida characterization of a new mannitol-producing metabolic pathway.
AB  == glucose metabolism of pasteurella multocida was examined in resting cells in vivo using 13c nmr spectroscopy, in cell-free extracts in vitro using 31p nmr spectroscopy and using enzyme assays. the nmr data indicate that glucose is converted by the embden-meyerhof and pentose phosphate pathways. the p. multocida fructose 6-phosphate phosphotransferase activity (the key enzyme of the embden-meyerhof pathway) was similar to that of escherichia coli. nevertheless, and in contrast to that of e. coli, its activity was inhibited by alpha glycerophosphate. this inhibition is consistent with the very low fructose 6-phosphate phosphotransferase activity found in cell-free extracts of p. multocida using a spectrophotometric method. the dominant end products of glucose metabolism were mannitol, acetate and succinate. under anaerobic conditions, p. multocida was able to constitutively produce mannitol from glucose, mannose, fructose, sucrose, glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate. we propose a new metabolic pathway in p. multocida where fructose 6-phosphate is reduced to mannitol 1-phosphate by fructose 6-phosphate reductase. mannitol 1-phosphate produced is then converted to mannitol by mannitol 1-phosphatase.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the ability of commercially available escherichia coli j5  bacterin to protect rabbits from experimental challenge with pasteurella multocida. animals: 40 p multocida-free new zealand white rabbits. procedures: rabbits were assigned to 1 of 4 groups of 10 rabbits each. three of the groups were inoculated sc with j5 bacterin at 8 weeks old. inoculation was repeated 3 and 6 weeks later. the fourth group was not inoculated and served as controls. groups 1, 2, and 3 were given 10(9), 10(8), and 10(7) colony forming units (cfu), respectively. response was monitored by titer assessment, using an e coli j5 antigen capture elisa. five weeks after the last inoculation, all rabbits were challenged with p multocida and observed for an additional 5 weeks. clinical, hematologic, serologic, culture, and necropsy data were collected. results: inoculation of rabbits with 10(9) cfu of e coli j5 bacterin-induced titers that were significantly greater than titers of rabbits vaccinated with 10(8) or 10(7)  cfu or those in controls. the incidence of acute bacteremia was lower in rabbits  with high titers. at necropsy, prevalence of lesions typical of p multocida was not significantly different among groups. prevalence of histologic lesions was also not significantly different among groups. conclusions and clinical relevance: although the bacterin induced considerable antibody response and possibly reduced the rate of bacteremia, antibodies were not protective against long-term colonization or infection of the frontal sinuses or tympanic bullae by  the challenge strain of p multocida. this bacterin in its currently available form is unlikely to aid in reducing the prevalence of pasteurellosis in rabbits.

AB  == we have shown that pasteurella multocida toxin (pmt) directly causes transient activation of gqalpha protein that is coupled to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase cbeta1 in xenopus oocytes (b. a. wilson, x. zhu, m. ho, and l. lu,  j. biol. chem. 272:1268-1275, 1997). we found that antibodies directed against an n-terminal peptide of pmt inhibited the toxin-induced response in xenopus oocytes, but antibodies against a c-terminal peptide did not. to test whether the intracellular activity domain of pmt is localized to the n terminus, we conducted a deletion mutational analysis of the pmt protein, using the xenopus oocyte system as a means of screening for toxin activity. using pcr and conventional cloning techniques, we cloned from a toxinogenic strain of p. multocida the entire toxa gene, encoding the 1,285-amino-acid pmt protein, and expressed the recombinant toxin as a his-tagged fusion protein in escherichia coli. we subsequently generated a series of n-terminal and c-terminal deletion mutants and expressed the his-tagged pmt fragments in e. coli. these proteins were screened for cytotoxic activity on cultured vero cells and for intracellular activity in the xenopus oocyte system. only the full-length protein without the his tag exhibited activity on vero cells. the full-length pmt and n-terminal fragments containing the first 500 residues elicited responses in oocytes, but the c-terminal 780 amino acid fragment did not. our results confirm that the intracellular activity domain of pmt is localized to the n-terminal 500 amino acids of the protein and that the c terminus is required for entry into cells.

TI  == postmortem detection of acute septicemia in broilers.
AB  == septicemia is an unwholesome condition diagnosed during postmortem inspection in  poultry slaughter establishments on the basis of macroscopic lesions. early identification of septicemia has important public health implications. in this study, pasteurella multocida, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus septicemia were induced in broilers in order to determine if lesions of acute septicemia can be grossly detected in the visceral organs of broiler carcasses prior to the development of changes in the skeletal muscle. increased spleen and  liver weights were observed during the acute phase of septicemia. airsacculitis,  pericarditis, and perihepatitis were observed during the acute phase of p. multocida- and e. coli-induced septicemia; and arthritis was the earliest indicator of s. aureus-induced septicemia. these macroscopic lesions were sufficient to identify unwholesome septicemic broiler carcasses prior to the development of changes in the skeletal muscle of the carcass.

TI  == transport of glucose by a phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system in pasteurella multocida.
AB  == pasteurella multocida was examined for glucose and mannose transport. p. multocida was shown to possess a phosphoenolpyruvate (pep):mannose phosphotransferase system (pts) that transports glucose as well as mannose and was functionally similar to the escherichia coli mannose pts. phosphorylated proteins with molecular masses similar to those of e. coli mannose pts proteins were visualized when incubated with 32p-pep. the presence of an enzyme iiaglc which could play an important role in regulation, as described in other gram-negative bacteria, was detected. the enzymes of the pentose-phosphate pathway were present in p. multocida growth on glucose. the activity of 6-phosphofructokinase (the key enzyme of the embden-meyerhof pathway (emp)), was  very low in cell extracts, suggesting that emp is not the major pathway for glucose catabolism.

TI  == identification and molecular cloning of a unique hyaluronan synthase from pasteurella multocida.
AB  == type a pasteurella multocida, a prevalent animal pathogen, employs a hyaluronan [ha] polysaccharide capsule to avoid host defenses. we utilized transposon insertional mutagenesis to identify the p. multocida ha synthase, the enzyme that polymerizes ha. a dna fragment from a wild-type genomic library could direct ha production in vivo in escherichia coli, a bacterium that normally does not produce ha. analysis of truncated plasmids derived from the original clone indicated that an open reading frame encoding a 972-residue protein was responsible for ha polymerization. this identification was confirmed by expression cloning in e. coli; we observed ha capsule formation in vivo and detected activity in membrane preparations in vitro. the polypeptide size was verified by photoaffinity labeling of the native p. multocida ha synthase with azido-udp sugar analogs. overall, the p. multocida sequence is not very similar to the other known ha synthases from streptococci, pbcv-1 virus, or vertebrates.  instead, a portion of the central region of the new enzyme is more homologous to  the amino termini of other bacterial glycosyltransferases that produce different  capsular polysaccharides or lipopolysaccharides. in summary, we have discovered a unique ha synthase that differs in sequence and predicted topology from the other known enzymes.

TI  == in vitro microbiological characterization of novel macrolide cp-163,505 for animal health specific use.
AB  == a novel 16-membered-ring macrolide agent (cp-163,505, a reductive amination derivative of repromicin) was identified as an antibacterial against pasteurella  haemolytica, p. multocida and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, important etiological agents of livestock respiratory disease. in vitro mic50/90 analysis revealed that cp-163,505 was more potent (4x) than tilmicosin against p. multocida, and equivalent to tilmicosin against p. haemolytica and a. pleuropneumoniae. in time kill kinetic studies, cp-163,505 showed bactericidal activity against p. haemolytica, p. multocida and a. pleuropneumoniae and bacteriostatic activity against e. coli at 8 times its mic. in vitro, cp-163,505  was more potent in alkaline ph (16 approximately 32 x ) and less potent in the presence of excess cations (mg+2 and ca+2, 4x). edta and pmbn increased cp-163,505 potency against e. coli (4x) but not against the other species. similar results were obtained with erythromycin a and tilmicosin, which were used as controls. from our data, we hypothesize that pasteurella and actinobacillus have an outer membrane significantly different from that of the typical enteric gram-negative bacterium e. coli.

TI  == identification of restriction barriers in pasteurella multocida.
AB  == several naturally occurring antibiotic resistance plasmids were isolated from pasteurella multocida type d strains. one plasmid, ppm1, was used to study transfer of dna among p. multocida strains, and could be transferred into escherichia coli and some p. multocida isolates. however, ppm1 could only be transferred into the toxigenic p. multocida lfb3 at very low frequency. plasmid recovered from the electrotransformants could be transferred to lfb3 at high frequency. these plasmid dnas were resistant to psti, and sensitive to dpni digestion. sensitivity to dpni was common to all the p. multocida dnas, but resistance to psti was confined to lfb3. plasmid ppm1 treated with psti methylase was able to transform lfb3 at an increased frequency compared to unmethylated dna, suggesting that lfb3 has a restriction system which cleaves at or near psti  sites.

AB  == the major outer membrane protein (omph) of pasteurella multocida x-73 was purified by selective extraction with detergents, followed by size exclusion chromatography. the planar lipid bilayer assay showed that omph has pore-forming  function. the average single channel conductance in 1.0 m kcl was 0.62 ns. the gene (omph) encoding omph has been isolated and sequenced by construction of a genomic library and pcr techniques. the coding region of this gene is 1,059 bp long. the predicted primary protein is composed of 353 amino acids, with a 20-amino-acid signal peptide. the mature protein is composed of 333 amino acids with a molecular mass of 36.665 kda. the omph gene encoding mature protein has been expressed in escherichia coli by using a regulatable expression system. the  omph gene was distributed among 15 p. multocida serotypes and strain cu. protection studies showed that omph was able to induce homologous protection in chickens. these findings demonstrate that omph is a protective outer membrane porin of strain x-73 and is conserved among p. multocida somatic serotypes.

TI  == molecular localization of the escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor cnf1  cell-binding and catalytic domains.
AB  == cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 1 (cnf1) induces, in epithelial cells, the development of stress fibres via the gtpase rho pathway. we showed that cnf1 is able to modify rho both in vitro and in vivo. recombinant n-terminal 33kda (cnf1nter) and c-terminal 14.8-31.5 kda (cnf1cter) regions of the cnf1 protein allowed us to demonstrate that the n-terminal region contains the cell-binding domain of the toxin and that the c-terminal region is responsible for its catalytic activity. cnf1nter lowered the activity of cnf1 when provided to cells  before the toxin whereas cnf1cter had no effect on cnf1 cell toxicity. cnf1cter was sufficient to induce a typical cnf1 phenotype when microinjected into african green monkey kidney cells (vero cells), and was able to modify rho as previously  reported for cnf1. the c-terminal domain lost its catalytic activity when deleted of various subdomains, suggesting a scattered distribution of catalytic-site amino acids. elucidation of the cnf1 functional organization and analysis of amino acid homologies between cnfs (cnf1, cnf2), pasteurella multocida toxin (pmt) and dermonecrotic toxin of bordetella pertussis (dnt) allowed us to postulate that cnfs and dnt act on rho via the same enzymatic activity located in their c-terminus, and that cnfs and pmt probably bind to analogous cell receptors.

AB  == the broad host-range cloning vectors, pjrd215 and pmmb67eh, were evaluated for stability and cloning efficiency in pasteurella multocida. transformation of p. multocida by electroporation was unreliable and poorly efficient regardless of whether the transforming dna was isolated from e. coli or p. multocida. both vectors contain a mob site that enabled transfer by conjugation from e. coli to p. multocida with high efficiency. kanamycin, streptomycin, and ampicillin resistance encoded by the vectors were expressed in p. multocida. lacz was cloned in pmmb67eh, an expression vector, and was transferred to p. multocida by conjugation. the transconjugants expressed a functional beta-galactosidase as determined by o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (onpg) test. we propose the  use of these cosmid and expression vectors as a shuttle vectors for cloning in p. multocida.

TI  == bacterial ghosts as multifunctional vaccine particles.
AB  == expression of cloned phix174 gene e in gram-negative bacteria results in lysis of the bacteria by formation of an e-specific transmembrane tunnel structure built through the cell envelope complex. bacterial ghosts have been produced from a variety of bacteria including escherichia coli. salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, vibrio cholerae, klebsiella pneumoniae, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pasteurella haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, and helicobacter pylori. such ghosts are used as non-living candidate  vaccines and represent an alternative to heat or chemically inactivated bacteria. in recombinant ghosts, foreign proteins can be inserted into the inner membrane prior to e-mediated lysis via specific n-, or c-, or n- and c-terminal anchor sequences. the export of proteins into the periplasmic space or the expression of recombinant s-layer proteins vastly extents the capacity of ghosts or recombinant ghosts as carriers of foreign epitopes or proteins. oral, aerogenic or parenteral applications of (recombinant) ghosts in experimental animals induced specific humoral and cellular immune responses against bacterial and target components including protective mucosal immunity. the most relevant advantage of ghosts and  recombinant bacterial ghosts as immunogens is that no inactivation procedures that denature relevant immunogenic determinants are employed in the production of ghosts used as vaccines or as carriers of relevant antigens. the inserted target  antigens into the inner membrane or into s-layer proteins are not limited in size.

TI  == characterization of a pasteurella multocida plasmid and its use to express recombinant proteins in p. multocida.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of a naturally occurring 5.36-kb streptomycin and sulphonamide resistance plasmid, designated pig1, isolated from type d pasteurella multocida was determined. a 1.6-kb noncoding region and a 1.4-kb region encoding three putative proteins were shown by sequence homologies and functional characterizations to be involved in the replication and mobilization of pig1, respectively. the remaining sequence carried an unusual arrangement of streptomycin- and sulphonamide-resistant genes when compared to various other plasmids. it appears that the antibiotic resistance region of pig1 may have evolved by recombination between three different short direct repeat dna sequences. a 4.5-kb recombinant plasmid was constructed by replacing the antibiotic resistance genes of pig1 with a kanamycin resistance gene and seven unique restriction sites. the resulting plasmid, designated pig112, stably replicates in p. multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and escherichia coli and can be introduced into these organisms by either transformation or conjugation. this vector exists at approximately 70 copies per cell in p. multocida and approximately 20 copies per cell in e. coli.  to demonstrate plasmid-borne gene expression in p. multocida, the p. multocida dermonecrotic toxin gene, toxa, and a genetically modified form of this gene were cloned into pig112 and expressed in high amounts in a nontoxigenic p. multocida strain. cell culture assays demonstrated that nontoxigenic p. multocida expressing toxa was cytopathic, whereas a strain expressing the modified toxa derivative was not.

TI  == species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
AB  == siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica, pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, streptococcus suis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. in some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of  the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). e. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-oh-n-oh-delta-n-acetyl-l-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter  inhibition zone). b. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine b and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. p. multocida and p. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. individual siderophores did not promote s. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. the antibacterial activities of the  intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or  lost, even against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated  to siderophores. conjugate-resistant e. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.

AB  == ceftiofur, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin, is active against a variety of animal pathogens, including organisms associated with swine respiratory disease.  however, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoint and disk diffusion interpretive criteria have not been established for swine pathogens. susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution mic and disk diffusion methods on 246 bacterial species that cause swine respiratory disease. ceftiofur  was active against salmonella sp., pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, streptococcus suis, and escherichia coli but was not active against bordetella bronchiseptica measured by mic. based on pharmacokinetic studies of ceftiofur in swine after a single intramuscular injection of 3 or 5 mg/kg body weight of ceftiofur and on the mic and disk diffusion data, we recommend mic breakpoints and disk diffusion distances, respectively, of < or = 2 micrograms/ml and > or = 21 mm for susceptible, 4 micrograms/ml and 18-20 mm for  intermediate, and > or = 8 micrograms/ml and > or = 17 mm for resistant classification for swine pathogens. when these breakpoints were applied to data from a previous study using bovine pathogens, only 1 minor interpretive error occurred.

TI  == molecular characterization of a common 48-kilodalton outer membrane protein of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.
AB  == previous studies have shown that a vaccine prepared from outer membranes of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 can elicit protective immunity in swine against challenge with either serotype 5 or serotype 1. these results suggest the presence of common subcapsular surface antigens, such as outer membrane proteins, that contribute to cross-protective immunity. we have identified a 48-kda outer membrane protein that is common to all 12 capsular serotypes of a. pleuropneumoniae but is not present in the outer membranes of related species of gram-negative swine pathogens. this protein is immunogenic in  swine infected with either a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 or 1a, as well as in swine vaccinated with a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 outer membranes. this 48-kda protein is readily detected in outer membranes produced by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, but it is sarcosyl soluble and therefore not found in outer membranes prepared by detergent treatment. the gene encoding the 48-kda outer membrane protein has been cloned from a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5 and and has been designated aopa, for actinobacillus outer membrane protein a. the gene is 1,347 bp in length and encodes a protein, designated aopa, of 449 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 48,603. southern blot analysis under high-stringency conditions showed that strains of all 12 serotypes of a. pleuropneumoniae contain dna homologous to this gene, as do strains of two closely related species, actinobacillus suis and pasteurella multocida. whether antibodies against the aopa antigen contribute to cross-protective immunity against a. pleuropneumoniae infection remains to be determined.

AB  == the mics of ceftiofur and other antimicrobial agents, tested for comparison, for  515 bacterial isolates of pigs from the united states, canada, and denmark with various diseases were compared. the organisms tested included actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, salmonella choleraesuis, salmonella typhimurium, streptococcus suis, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, streptococcus equi subsp. equi, and streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus. in addition to ceftiofur, the following  antimicrobial agents or combinations were tested: enrofloxacin, ampicillin, sulfamethazine, trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (1:19), erythromycin, lincomycin, spectinomycin, lincomycin-spectinomycin (1:8), tilmicosin, and tetracycline. tilmicosin was only tested against the u.s. isolates. overall, ceftiofur and enrofloxacin were the most active antimicrobial agents tested against all isolates, with mics inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (mic90s) of < or = 2.0 and  < or = 1.0 microgram/ml, respectively. erythromycin, sulfamethazine, spectinomycin, and lincomycin demonstrated limited activity against all of the organisms tested, with mic90s of > or = 8.0, > or = 256.0, > or = 32.0, and > or  = 16.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. trimethoprim-sulfadiazine was active against  isolates of a. pleuropneumoniae, s. choleraesuis, s. typhimurium, p. multocida, s. equi, and s. suis (mic90s, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) but was less active against the e. coli strains tested (mic90, > 16.0 micrograms/ml). ampicillin was  active against the p. multocida, s. suis, and s. equi isolates tested (mic90s, 0.5, 0.06, and 0.06 micrograms/ml, respectively) and was moderately active against s. typhimurium (mic90s, 2.0 micrograms/ml). however, this antimicrobial agent was much less active when it was tested against a. pleuropneumoniae, s. cholerae-suis, and e. coli (mic90s, 16.0, > 32.0, and 32.0 micrograms/ml, respectively). against the u.s. isolates of a. pleuropneumoniae and p. multocida, tilmicosin was moderately active (mic90s, 4.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively). however, this compound was not active against the remaining u.s. isolates (mic90s, > 64.0 micrograms/ml). differences in the mics from one country to another were not detected with enrofloxacin, ceftiofur, or lincomycin for the  strains tested, but variations in the mics of the remaining antimicrobial agents  were observed.

TI  == characterization of the pasteurella multocida skp and fira genes.
AB  == a 2.9-kb fragment of the pasteurella multocida (pm) genome encoding proteins p25  (25 kda) and p28 (28 kda) has previously been cloned and expressed in escherichia coli (ec). in the present paper, the nucleotide (nt) sequence of a 1.8-kb subfragment encoding the two proteins is described. the cloned fragment contains  three open reading frames (orfs). orf1 is incomplete. orf2 is homologous to the skp gene of ec. orf3 overlaps orf2 and is highly homologous to the fira gene of ec. the skp and fira genes are part of an operon governing the first steps of lipid a synthesis. comparing the nt sequence with the n-terminal sequences of p25 and p28 revealed that the two proteins are encoded by orf2 (skp). the preprotein  p28 is converted into p25 by cleavage of a 23-amino-acid leader peptide. though it serologically cross-reacts with porin h of pm, p25 is not related to known bacterial porins.

TI  == antibacterial activity of marbofloxacin. a new fluoroquinolone for veterinary use against canine and feline isolates.
AB  == marbofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone developed exclusively for veterinary use.  minimum inhibitory concentrations of marbofloxacin were assessed for 816 recent isolates associated with canine or feline diseases. marbofloxacin showed a broad  spectrum of activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. in vitro rates of killing of marbofloxacin and enrofloxacin were compared against strains  of staphylococcus intermedius and pasteurella multocida, and the results showed no marked difference between the two antibiotics. the duration of bactericidal activity was evaluated ex vivo in the urine of dogs and cats treated with marbofloxacin and lasted from 2 to 5 days after a single administration according to the dosages. post-antibiotic effect durations were determined with escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus intermedius and were found almost equal to those of enrofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. these results predict a great potential for marbofloxacin in the treatment of a wide range of diseases in dogs and cats.

TI  == the effect of plasmid acquisition on potential virulence attributes of pasteurella multocida.

TI  == pasteurella multocida produces a protein with homology to the p6 outer membrane protein of haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == an antibody specific for a 16-kda outer membrane protein of a rabbit strain of pasteurella multocida was used to probe representatives of all 16 somatic serotypes of p. multocida, as well as the vaccine strains cu and m9, and all were shown to express the protein. the gene encoding this protein was cloned and sequenced and found to have extensive sequence homology with the gene encoding the p6 protein of haemophilus influenzae. the protein in p. multocida has been designated p6-like. the gene encoding the p6-like protein was used to probe members of the family pasteurellaceae and other gram-negative bacteria. representatives of all 16 somatic serotypes (as well as the vaccine strains cu and m9) of p. multocida hybridized with the p6-like gene under conditions of high stringency. the dna from h. influenzae hybridized weakly with the p6-like gene under these conditions, but pasteurella haemolytica (representatives of a and t biotypes), bordetella bronchiseptica, b. avium, actinobacillus suis, a. suis-like, a. lignieresii, a. ureae, a. rossii, a. pleuropneumoniae, a. equuli, and various members of the family enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and salmonella typhimurium) did not hybridize detectably.  under conditions of lower stringency, the p6-like gene also hybridized strongly with dna from p. multocida, h. influenzae, and a. rossii but weakly with dna from p. haemolytica and members of the genus actinobacillus. these results suggest that the p6-like protein of p. multocida might be useful as an immunizing product to protect poultry from avian cholera. this suggestion stems from (i) our finding that the p6-like protein in p. multocida is widely distributed among all the somatic serotypes and (ii) the previous work of others demonstrating that the p6  protein of h. influenzae elicits a protective immune response in animal models of human disease.

TI  == effect of polymyxin b nonapeptide on daptomycin permeability and cell surface properties in pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and pasteurella multocida.
AB  == the present study was carried out to determine if sensitization of gram-negative  bacteria to the polyanionic antibiotic daptomycin by cationic molecules can be explained on the basis of decreased cell surface charge in order to better understand intrinsic resistance. turbidimetric assessments of batch cultural growth kinetics revealed the outer membrane permeabilizer polymyxin b nonapeptide sensitized pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli to the hydrophobic probe novobiocin, whereas little or no sensitization was observed for two surface hydrophobicity variants of pasteurella multocida. polymyxin b nonapeptide and daptomycin synergistically inhibited growth of p. aeruginosa only. a hydrocarbon  adherence assay revealed permeabilizing concentrations of polymyxin b nonapeptide increased cell surface hydrophobicity of p. aeruginosa and the hydrophobic p. multocida variant, while e. coli and the hydrophilic p. multocida variant remained unaffected. measurement of cellular electrophoretic mobility showed polymyxin b nonapeptide permeabilization of p. aeruginosa to daptomycin occurred  concomitantly with a significant decrease in cell surface charge, while no such sensitization occurred in organisms which failed to undergo polymyxin b nonapeptide-induced surface charge decreases. these data suggest that sensitization of gram-negative bacteria to polyanionic lipopeptides by growth in  the presence of polycationic outer membrane permeabilizers such as polymyxin b nonapeptide is dependent on diminution of overall cell surface charge and polarity, thereby allowing outer cell envelope permeation.

TI  == molecular fingerprinting of pasteurella multocida associated with progressive atrophic rhinitis in swine herds.
AB  == ninety-six nasal isolates of pasteurella multocida from swine herds with progressive atrophic rhinitis were characterized by restriction endonuclease analysis (rea) of whole-cell dna, ribotyping, and plasmid analysis. for rea, bacterial dna was digested with smai and electrophoresed in 0.7% agarose, and fragments were visualized with uv light. for ribotyping, ecori-digested and electrophoresed restriction fragments of whole-cell dna were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, hybridized with gamma-32p-labeled escherichia coli ribosomal rna, and visualized by autoradiography. phenotypes of isolates were toxigenic capsular type d (n = 51), nontoxigenic type d (n = 28), nontoxigenic type a (n = 16), and toxigenic type a (n = 1). plasmids of various sizes were evident in 92.2% and 17.9% of toxigenic and nontoxigenic d strains, respectively, but were absent from all type a strains. among the 4 phenotypes, there were 17 rea profiles and 6 ribotypes. for 3 of 17 rea patterns, multiple ribotypes were evident, and several rea types were evident in 5 of 6 ribotypes. thirty-seven isolates of toxigenic capsular type d from australian herds were either smai type b or c and ribotype 2, whereas 14 toxigenic d isolates from the usa and other countries were more heterogeneous (7 rea types and 6 ribotypes). the fingerprinting results provided evidence in support of the hypothesis of a single source infection in australia associated with the introduction of breeding pigs from overseas.

TI  == characterization of the dermonecrotic toxin in members of the genus bordetella.
AB  == all members of the genus bordetella and pasteurella multocida (a gram-negative bacillus genetically unrelated to bordetella spp., yet often sharing the same ecological niche) produce a dermonecrotic toxin (dnt). the amount of toxin produced and the time required for appearance of the lesions are identical for bordetella pertussis, b. parapertussis, and b. bronchiseptica but different for p. multocida and b. avium. dnt has been reported to act by promoting vasoconstriction; however, vasoactive compounds (verapamil, prazosin, hydralazine, tolazoline, or isoxsuprine) are able to reverse the action of the toxin only slightly. vasoconstrictors (atropine, serotonin, epinephrine, or endothelin) did not produce dnt-like lesions. we have characterized a region of dna essential for dnt expression. we have determined by southern analysis that the restriction map of the dnt gene is nearly identical in b. pertussis, b. parapertussis, and b. bronchiseptica, but the sequences are not present in toxigenic b. avium and p. multocida strains. a gentamicin resistance-origin of transfer cassette cloned into a 1.8-kb noti-bamhi fragment results in constructs  which can be mobilized and recombined into the bordetella chromosome, rendering the resultant b. pertussis, b. parapertussis, and b. bronchiseptica strains negative for dnt. a 5-kb bamhi-apai fragment from the b. pertussis chromosome was sequenced and revealed homology to the escherichia coli cnf1 (cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1) toxin.

TI  == cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 2 produced by virulent escherichia coli modifies the small gtp-binding proteins rho involved in assembly of actin stress  fibers.
AB  == cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 2 (cnf2) produced by escherichia coli strains isolated from intestinal and extraintestinal infections is a dermonecrotic toxin  of 110 kda. we cloned the cnf2 gene from a large plasmid carried by an escherichia coli strain isolated from a lamb with septicemia. hydropathy analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed a largely hydrophilic protein with two potential hydrophobic transmembrane domains. the n-terminal half of cnf2 showed striking homology (27% identity and 80% conserved residues) to the n-terminal portion of pasteurella multocida toxin. methylamine protection experiments and immunofluorescence studies suggested that cnf2 enters the cytosol of the target cell through an acidic compartment and induces the reorganization of actin into stress fibers. since the formation of stress fibers in eukaryotic cells involves rho proteins, we radiolabeled these small gtp-binding proteins from cnf2-treated and control cells with a rho-specific adp-ribosyltransferase. the [32p]adp-ribosylated rho proteins from cnf2-treated cells migrated slightly more slowly in sds/page than did the labeled proteins from the control cells. this shift in mobility of rho proteins in sds/page was also observed when cnf2 and the rhoa protein were coexpressed in e. coli. we propose that rho proteins are the targets of cnf2 in mammalian cells.

TI  == the haemophilus influenzae adenylate cyclase gene: cloning, sequence, and essential role in competence.
AB  == competence for transformation in haemophilus influenzae is stimulated by cyclic amp (camp) and requires the camp-dependent catabolite regulatory protein crp. thus, understanding the control of competence will require understanding how camp levels are regulated. as a first step, we have cloned the h. influenzae adenylate cyclase gene (cya) by complementing the lac- phenotype of delta cya escherichia coli. its sequence specifies an 843-amino-acid protein which has significant identity to other known bacterial adenylate cyclases (41 to 43% and 61% identical to the cya genes of enteric bacteria and of pasteurella multocida, respectively). as seen in other bacterial cya genes, there is evidence for regulation similar to that demonstrated for e. coli: the presence of a strong consensus crp binding site within the promoter of the gene may provide feedback control of camp levels  by repressing cya transcription, and translation may be limited by the weak ribosome binding site and by initiation of protein synthesis with gug rather than aug or the uug used in other bacterial cya genes. we confirmed the essential role of camp in competence by constructing and characterizing h. influenzae cya mutants. this strain failed to develop competence either spontaneously or after transfer to a competence-inducing medium. however, it became as competent as its  wild-type parent in the presence of exogenous camp. this result suggests that the failure of exogenously added camp to induce optimum competence in wild-type cells is not due to a limitation to the entry of camp into the cells. rather, it strongly favors models in which competence induction requires both an increase in intracellular camp and a second as yet unidentified regulatory event. h. influenzae strains mutant in cya or crp were unable to ferment xylose or ribose.  this confirms that influenzae, like e. coli, uses camp and crp to regulate nutrient uptake and utilization and lends increasing support to the hypothesis that dna uptake is mechanism of nutrient acquisition.

TI  == molecular analysis of a cryptic plasmid isolated from avian strains of pasteurella multocida.
AB  == twelve small plasmids isolated from avian strains of pasteurella multocida were examined by restriction enzyme mapping, cross-hybridization, and minicell analysis. these plasmids contained sites for several commonly used restriction enzymes and ranged in size from 3.4 to 3.8 kilobases. restriction enzyme maps of  the 12 plasmids were similar and divided the plasmids into 3 families, designated pfs1, pfs2, and pfs4. restriction fragments of pfs1 dna isolated from strain x-73 were used to probe avai/hindiii/ecorv digests of pfs2 and pfs4 dna. the results of these hybridization experiments demonstrated that the plasmids found in all three families shared extensive regions of homology and may have originated from  a common ancestor. escherichia coli minicells containing recombinant plasmid constructs bearing fragments of pfs1 expressed two pfs1-specific peptides, 12.5 and 28 kilodaltons in size, suggesting that some p. multocida plasmid-encoded proteins can be expressed in e. coli. these results indicate that pfs may be useful as a genetic tool for moving dna into and out of p. multocida, since it is small, contains common restriction sites, and encodes at least two genes that are recognized and expressed in e. coli.

AB  == pulmonary surfactant has been shown to play an increasingly important role in bacterial clearance at the alveolar surface in the lung. this study describes a bactericidal mechanism in which ovine pulmonary surfactant induces killing of pasteurella haemolytica by normal serum. to demonstrate killing, six bacterial species were incubated first with pulmonary surfactant for 60 min at 37 degrees c and then with serum for an additional 60 min at 37 degrees c. p. haemolytica type a1 strains 82-25 and l101, a p. haemolytica type 2 strain, escherichia coli, and  klebsiella pneumoniae were susceptible and pasteurella multocida, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not susceptible to killing by ovine pulmonary surfactant and normal serum. no bacteria incubated with bovine pulmonary surfactant were killed by normal serum. although the species origin of  pulmonary surfactant was selective, the species origin of serum was not. p. haemolytica incubated with ovine pulmonary surfactant was killed by fetal calf serum, gnotobiotic calf serum, pooled normal sheep serum, pooled normal rabbit serum, and pooled guinea pig serum. ultrastructurally, killed p. haemolytica suspensions contained dead cells and cells distorted with vacuoles between the cytoplasmic membrane and the cytoplasm. the mechanism of killing did not correlate with concentrations of complement or lysozyme or titers of residual antibody in either the pulmonary surfactant or the serum, and killing was reduced by preincubation of surfactant with p. haemolytica lipopolysaccharide. preliminary characterization of both surfactant and serum implicate a low-molecular-weight proteinaceous component in the surfactant and serum albumin  in the serum. this mechanism may help clear certain gram-negative bacteria from the lungs of sheep as a part of the pulmonary innate defense system.

TI  == leishmania major: bacterial contamination of cutaneous lesions in experimental animals.
AB  == no bacterial contamination has been demonstrated in cutaneous leishmaniasis (cl)  nodule and in lesions caused by leishmania major in balb/c mice up to 20 days after infection. however, although many phagocytic cells (polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages) were present in the cl lesion, 80% of the lesions showed bacterial contamination that developed within the first 70 days of infection. topical treatment of the lesion with an ointment containing 15% paromomycin and 12% methylbenzethonium chloride in soft white paraffin for 20 days eliminated all the leishmania parasites and several of the associated bacteria including: proteus vulgaris, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus albus and staphylococcus aureus. this treatment did not affect escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. total elimination of these bacteria was achieved only during the healing process, and within 20 days following termination of treatment. the rate of disappearance of bacteria inoculated alone  into the base of the tail of normal uninfected balb/c mice was much faster than that of bacteria inoculated into either the cl nodule or the cl lesion. this study suggests the development of local immunosuppression in the cl lesion that may be mediated by the leishmania parasites and their metabolites.

TI  == polymyxin b: pharmacokinetics of single doses given intravenously and intramuscularly to turkeys, and minimal inhibitory concentrations for escherichia coli and pasteurella multocida.
AB  == the 50% and 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic50 and mic90) of polymyxin  b for avian escherichia coli and pasteurella multocida isolates were determined by the agar plate dilution method. polymyxin b at approximate mic level in serum  was bactericidal for e. coli in 2 to 4 hours. aqueous polymyxin b sulfate was administered by a single bolus intravenous injection into turkeys at 10,000 iu/kg, and by a single bolus intramuscular injection at 5,000, 10,000 or 20,000 iu/kg. effective serum drug concentrations after intramuscular injection (mic50 levels or greater) were maintained for e. coli for 7.0 hr (10,000 iu/kg) and 11.5 hr (20,000 iu/kg), and for p. multocida for 3.0 hr (10,000 iu/kg) and 4.1 hr (20,000 iu/kg). pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by non-compartmental methods. elimination time half-lives, mean residence time, clearance, and apparent volume of distribution at steady state (vdss) were all much higher for i.m. injection of 20,000 iu/kg than for i.m. injection of 10,000 iu/kg. we postulate that there exists a minimal tissue-interaction threshold concentration  (mtc) at which polymyxin b can enter previously unavailable compartments or bind  to previously refractory tissue components. bioavailability of polymyxin b injected i.m. was 0.904 for the 10,000 iu/kg dose and 0.675 for the 20,000 iu/kg  dose. dosage intervals necessary to produce minimal steady state concentrations (cssmin) equal to the mic were calculated. certain aspects of the use of the parameter vdss, and limitations on the use of dosage interval calculations for polymyxin b, are discussed. one week after i.m. injection of polymyxin b at 10,000 iu/kg, high tissue drug levels were present, especially in bound form in liver. following single injections, no toxic effects on turkeys were observed.

TI  == turkey macrophage and heterophil bactericidal activity against pasteurella multocida.
AB  == bactericidal activity of turkey macrophages and heterophils was demonstrated in an in vitro colorimetric bactericidal assay. two vaccine strains and one field isolate of pasteurella multocida a:3,4 and a single isolate each of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus were compared for susceptibility to the bactericidal activity of turkey macrophages and heterophils. only p. multocida a:3,4-strain m-9 (the least virulent strain) was susceptible to macrophage bactericidal activity in the absence of specific immune serum, whereas all three  p. multocida a:3,4 organisms were killed when opsonized with specific immune serum. e. coli was susceptible to the bactericidal activity of macrophages, and s. aureus was resistant. all bacteria tested were highly sensitive to the bactericidal activity of intact turkey heterophils, regardless of the opsonin treatment. electron microscopic findings suggested that heterophils may kill extracellular p. multocida. only s. aureus and e. coli were killed by lysed heterophils.

AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of escherichia coli and pasteurella multocida isolated from poultry was determined to danofloxacin, a novel fluoroquinolone, and five other commonly used antimicrobials. a total of 1737 e. coli field isolates and 107 p. multocida isolates were tested by veterinary diagnostic laboratories in europe, japan, south africa, and north america during the period  1989-91. the antimicrobial susceptibility of these isolates was determined using  the sensititre broth microdilution technique. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of danofloxacin, furaltadone, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, spectinomycin, and trimethoprim:sulfamethoxazole that prevented growth of 90% of  the bacteria were 0.25 > 64, > 64, > 64, > 128, and > 16 micrograms/ml, respectively, against e. coli isolates and 0.25, 64, 64, 16, 128, and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively, against p. multocida isolates. danofloxacin demonstrated considerable in vitro potency against these important poultry pathogens, many of which showed extensive resistance to the other antimicrobials  tested.

TI  == long-term study of aerobic bacteria of the genital tract in stud dogs.
AB  == the aerobic bacterial flora of the genital tract was characterized in 15 stud dogs in an 18-month study. the dogs represented 4 breeds and were from 3 kennels. bacterial samples from the prepuce and semen were collected every month, except in connection with matings, when they were collected weekly (464 samples). the dogs that were included all mated at least once during the study. the mean pregnancy rate, litter size, and pup mortality for the bitches with which they had mated were all within normal limits. the most frequent bacteria isolated from the prepuce and semen were pasteurella multocida, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and escherichia coli. there was a tendency for breeds to differ in frequency of the most common bacterial species. bacterial culture yielded no aerobic growth in 14.2% of the preputial samples and 69.8% of the semen samples. bacteria were transferred between dog and bitch at mating. in this study of healthy breeding dogs, neither the fertility of the dog nor that of the bitch was affected by the  bacteria transferred.

TI  == long-term study of aerobic bacteria of the genital tract in breeding bitches.
AB  == the aerobic bacterial flora of the genital tract was characterized in 59 bitches  in an 18-month study. the bitches represented 4 breeds and were from 3 kennels. collection of vaginal swab specimens for bacterial culturing was performed every  month, except during estrus when specimens were collected every week (n = 826). the capsule of the swab containing transport media was broken before specimen collection to moisten the tip, which helped to reduce the number of negative cultures. all bitches helped at least once during the study and, thus, had known  reproductive functions. pregnancy rates, litter sizes, and pup mortality were within normal limits. pasteurella multocida, beta-hemolytic streptococci group g, and escherichia coli were the most common bacteria isolated. although these species generally were isolated from mixed cultures, pure cultures were obtained  from 18% of the specimens. there was a tendency for the various breeds to differ  in their vaginal bacterial flora. the flora also varied during the reproductive cycle. pasteurella multocida was isolated significantly more often during proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and pregnancy, than during anestrus and the postpartum period, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were isolated significantly more often during proestrus than during estrus, pregnancy, or the postpartum period. staphylococcus intermedius was almost exclusively found after parturition. culture results were negative for only 5.2% of specimens cultured. on the basis of our findings, bacterial culturing of vaginal swab specimens from  bitches without signs of genital disease is of little value.

AB  == one hundred and sixty-four clinical isolates of pasteurella multocida recovered from two swine herds in minnesota were characterized by restriction endonuclease  analysis (rea) and rrna gene restriction fragment length patterns. bacterial dna  was digested with hpaii and electrophoresed in 0.55% agarose. restriction fragments were transferred by southern blot to nylon membranes and then hybridized with digoxigenin-dutp-labeled escherichia coli rrna. four different rea patterns were observed among the 156 serotype a strains isolated from herds a and b. the two most common rea types (1 and 2) represented 92% of the strains analyzed, while rea types 3 and 4 were observed only in lung samples and accounted for 8% of the isolates. two different ribotypes were observed for these serotype a isolates. ribotype i consisted of the most common types, 1 and 2, found by dna fingerprinting. ribotype ii included rea types 3 and 4. results from both herds suggest that in closed swine populations, a single strain of p. multocida predominates and causes disease. it is concluded that these genomic fingerprinting techniques were highly discriminatory and that capsular serotyping in combination with rea or ribotyping is an appropriate technique for epidemiological studies of p. multocida of swine origin.

TI  == release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha from bovine alveolar macrophages stimulated with bovine respiratory viruses and bacterial endotoxins.
AB  == the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) from cultured bovine alveolar macrophages (bam) was evaluated following stimulation of bam with bovine herpesvirus-1 (bhv-1), parainfluenza-3 (pi-3) virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (brsv), escherichia coli 0111:b4 endotoxin, pasteurella haemolytica type 1  endotoxin, pasteurella multocida endotoxin, and virus/endotoxin combinations. a cytotoxic assay system using georgia bovine kidney cells as targets was used to measure tnf-alpha activity. the cytotoxic activity was neutralized by an anti-human tnf-alpha monoclonal antibody. stimulation of bam with 1 median tissue culture infectious dose (tcid50) of live or ultraviolet (uv)-inactivated pi-3 virus/cell resulted in release of tnf-alpha in significantly (p less than 0.05) higher amounts than sham-induced bam. the quantities of tnf-alpha released after  live or uv-inactivated bhv-1 or brsv induction were not significantly higher than sham-induced bam. e. coli 0111:b4, p. haemolytica type 1 and p. multocida endotoxins stimulated tnf-alpha release in a dose-dependent manner. sequential exposure of bam to 1 tcid50 per cell of either live bhv-1, pi-3 virus or brsv and then 5 micrograms ml-1 of either e. coli 0111:b4, p. haemolytica type 1 or p. multocida endotoxin caused a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in detectable tnf-alpha in seven of nine virus/endotoxin combinations tested, when compared with 5 micrograms ml-1 of endotoxin alone. parainfluenza-3 virus/endotoxin combinations stimulated higher tnf-alpha release when compared with other virus/endotoxin combinations. five out of six test animals had serum-neutralizing antibodies to pi-3 virus, one out of six had serum-neutralizing antibodies to bhv-1, and two out of six had serum-neutralizing antibodies to brsv, suggesting a possible relationship between serum neutralizing antibodies and tnf-alpha release from in vitro cultivated bam.

TI  == [purification, amino acid composition and n-terminal sequence of the major protein (protein h) of the outer membrane of pasteurella multocida].
AB  == the major protein (protein h) of the outer membrane of pasteurella multocida was  purified by size-exclusion chromatography after selective extraction with detergents. the protein forms homotrimers which are stable in the presence of sds at room temperature. upon treatment at 100 degrees c, the protein is fully dissociated by the detergent into monomers exhibiting an apparent molecular mass  of 37 kda as estimated by electrophoresis. the amino acid composition of protein  h is characterized by a low hydropathy index (hi = -0.40) and is strongly related to the compositions of bacterial porins, notably porins p2 (haemophilus influenzae), pia (neisseria gonorrhoeae) and cl.2 ("class 2 porin" of n. meningitidis). the n-terminal amino acid sequence of protein h shares a strong homology with those of porins ompc (escherichia coli) and p2. these data indicate that protein h of p. multocida is a porin belonging to the superfamily of the non-specific porins of gram-negative eubacteria outer membrane.

TI  == structural and functional relationships between pasteurella multocida and enterobacterial adenylate cyclases.
AB  == the pasteurella multocida adenylate cyclase gene has been cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. the primary structure of the protein (838 amino acids) deduced  from the corresponding nucleotide sequence was compared with that of e. coli. the two enzymes have similar molecular sizes and, based on sequence conservation at the protein level, are likely to be organized in two functional domains: the amino-terminal catalytic domain and the carboxy-terminal regulatory domain. it was shown that p. multocida adenylate cyclase synthesizes increased levels of cyclic amp in e. coli strains deficient in the catabolite gene activator protein  compared with wild-type strains. this increase does not occur in strains deficient in both the catabolite gene activator protein and enzyme iii-glucose, indicating that a protein similar to e. coli enzyme iii-glucose is involved in the regulation of p. multocida adenylate cyclase. it also indicates that the underlying process leading to enterobacterial adenylate cyclase activation has been conserved through evolution.

AB  == serum activities of gamma-glutamyl transferase (ggt), alkaline phosphatase (ap),  aspartate aminotransferase (ast), and concentrations of total bilirubin and total bile acids were screened during a 5 year period in 27 horses used for production  of hyperimmune serum. the horses investigated were regularly immunized with live  cultures of the endotoxin-releasing bacteria escherichia coli or pasteurella multocida, the individual animals having undergone such treatment for periods varying from 2 weeks to 10 years. in a majority of the horses, ggt-activity had increased within 6 to 7 years of first having undergone immunization. constantly  high values seemed to co-incide with the presence of advanced liver amyloidosis,  as demonstrated by histopathological examination after slaughter. the ap activity was also increased but only moderately compared with ggt. individual values more  than 10-fold greater than the upper reference limit were recorded for ggt, while  the highest ap values were less than double the upper reference limit. activity of ast and bilirubin concentrations remained unaffected, whereas the concentration of total bile acids rose after 6 to 7 years of immunization compared to the baseline value. it is concluded that the determination of serum activities of ggt may serve as a practical routine test for the evaluation of liver amyloidosis status in serum horses.

TI  == molecular aspects of the virulence of pasteurella multocida.
AB  == molecules important to the virulence of all pasteurella multocida are little known, but much has been learned of isolates causing atrophic rhinitis of pigs. a protein toxin purified from p. multocida or from a recombinant escherichia coli reproduces atrophic rhinitis and leads to a reduction in weight gain; antitoxin is completely protective. toxin is important for p. multocida colonization, especially in the presence of the bordetella bronchiseptica cytotoxin. the p. multocida toxin binds rapidly to embryonic bovine lung cells in vitro leading to  an alteration of cell shape without the metabolic and structural changes associated with other toxins. this indicates a novel biochemical mechanism. however, other work suggests a subunit mode of action structurally like hormones  and other bacterial toxins.

AB  == pasteurella multocida transconjugants isolated after mating with escherichia coli strains that carry one or the other of two tn7-containing suicide plasmids, prktv5 and puw964 (prktv5::tn5), were analysed. these plasmids have the cole1 replication origin and were thus expected to deliver transposons but not be maintained as free replicons in pasteurella. five out of six transconjugants selected for acquisition of tn7 from e. coli (prktv5) had simple insertions of the transposon, in either orientation, at a single chromosomal location, while the sixth had prktv5 integrated at the same location. by contrast, all of 27 transconjugants selected for acquisition of either tn7 or tn5 from e. coli (puw964) maintained puw964. of seven subsequently examined at the molecular level, all had puw964 (in one case, a deletion derivative) integrated at the same location as the tn7 insertions obtained with prktv5. a copy of tn7 was present at each boundary between the integrated plasmids (prktv5 or puw964) and the chromosome in each strain. the two copies of tn7 at either end of an integrated plasmid were either in the same (six cases) or in opposite (two cases) orientations with respect to each other. these seem to be products of replicative transposition by tn7 but can also derive from conservative mechanisms.

TI  == cloning and expression of the pasteurella multocida toxin gene, toxa, in escherichia coli.
AB  == a chromosomal dna library of a toxigenic type d strain of pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida was established in escherichia coli. from this library two clones, spe308 and spe312, were identified by using a monoclonal antibody against the osteoclast-stimulating p. multocida toxin (pmt). extracts of these clones showed cytopathic activity identical to that of extracts of toxigenic p. multocida. the recombinant plasmids, pspe308 and pspe312, directed the synthesis  of a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 143,000 which could be specifically detected by anti-pmt antibody. the recombinant toxin, which was located in the cytoplasm of e. coli, was purified by affinity chromatography with immobilized monoclonal antibody and was shown to react in a manner identical to that of pmt in a quantitative structural test using a series of monoclonal antibodies as well as in all quantitative functional tests used, i.e., tests for  dermonecrotic activity and mouse lethality and the embryonic bovine lung cell test for cytopathic activity. the gene encoding this toxic activity was named toxa and was found to be present in the chromosome of toxigenic strains only of p. multocida. a probe spanning the toxa gene therefore has potential in the diagnosis and surveillance of progressive atrophic rhinitis in pigs.

TI  == transfer and properties of some natural and suicide replicons in pasteurella multocida.
AB  == we tested the transfer of several plasmids and transposons from escherichia coli  to pasteurella multocida by filter mating. two plasmids, prktv5 (prk2013::tn7) and puw964 (prktv5::tn5), were derived from prk2013--a narrow-host-range plasmid  with the broad-host-range incp conjugation genes. most p. multocida transconjugants obtained with prktv5 had tn7 insertions in the chromosome but some had insertions of the whole plasmid. by contrast, all the transconjugants obtained with puw964 had insertions of this plasmid or a deleted variant. puw964  mediated low-frequency transfer of tn7 or chromosomal markers between p. multocida strains. broad-host-range incp plasmid rp4 (rk2) did not yield selectable transconjugants in p. multocida but two plasmids derived by tn5 insertion into a kanamycin-sensitive derivative of rp4 did yield transconjugants. psup1011, a narrow-host-range p15a replicon with the rp4 mob region allowing mobilization by the incp conjugation genes also yielded transconjugants while several other plasmids tested did not transfer markers to p. multocida.

TI  == in vivo studies with dimethyldithiocarbamate, a possible new antimicrobial for use against aspergillus fumigatus in poultry.
AB  == dimethyldithiocarbamate (dmdtc), the carbamate analogue, was tested for therapeutic efficacy in a series of in vivo challenge trials using 5- and 10-week-old white leghorn chickens. challenge organisms were pasteurella multocida x-73, escherichia coli o1:k1, and aspergillus fumigatus. birds were evaluated for survival rates, lesion scores, and the rate at which the bacteria or mold could be reisolated following challenge. results showed dmdtc to be ineffective against p. multocida and e. coli at the treatment levels and in the form used in these trials, but dmdtc significantly reduced lesion scores and inhibited the rate of isolation of a. fumigatus compared with untreated infected  birds.

AB  == between 1982 and 1985 the cadavers of 50 guillemots (uria aalge), 41 kittiwakes (rissa tridactyla), 26 herring gulls (larus argentatus) and 34 black-headed gulls (larus ridibundus) were examined pathological, bacteriological and virological. the probable cause of death was established. parasitosis were particularly prevalent in herring gulls (49%), where the main infection--as in black-headed gulls--was with cestoides. in kittiwakes and guillemots mainly spiruroideae were  recorded. the commonest bacterium isolated in organs and intestinal tract was escherichia coli, followed by aeromonas hydrophila and clostridium perfringens. salmonella were found in the organs of 5% and in the intestinal tract of 3% of the birds. the species of salmonella most frequently isolated was salmonella typhimurium varieties copenhagen. also recorded were yersinia intermedia serovar  0:17 (1x), pseudomonas spp. (2x), bacteria of the haemophilus-pasteurella-actinobacillus group (1x), pasteurella multocida (2x), moraxella septicaemiae (1x), campylobacter spec. (1x), mycoplasma spec. (6x), dnase positive staphylococcus spec. (4x) and streptococcus spec. (6x). less in evidence among the birds examined were fungus diseases with aspergillus spec. (4x) and blastomyces spec. (4x). as for viruses one guillemot was found to have an adenovirus and another one to have a paramyxovirus. from one of the herring gulls there also was isolated a paramyxovirus, from a second one to a reovirus. three other species isolated have get to be identified. the chief cause of sickness and death in the guillemots was oil-contamination. the majority of the examined kittiwakes and herring gulls were victims of pathogenic agents. many of  the black-headed gulls died through traumata as gunshots or road traffic etc. in  order to establish the causes of sickness and death in seabirds and to ascertain  the importance of the various species as possible carriers of infectious diseases, a systematic series of investigation will be necessary. without this it will not be possible to assess their epidemiological relevance for other wild birds, domestic poultry and humans.

AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of cephalexin, cephradine, cefaclor,  cefatrizine and cefadroxil for salmonella species, escherichia coli and pasteurella multocida isolated previously from young calves were determined. the  mic90 values for cephalexin, cephradine and cefadroxil ranged between 3.12 micrograms ml-1 and 12.5 micrograms ml-1, whereas those of cefatrizine and cefaclor were 3.12 micrograms ml-1 and 0.78 microgram ml-1, respectively. each drug was administered intravenously and orally to groups of pre-ruminating calves and orally to early ruminating calves. although the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drugs after intravenous injection were similar to other beta-lactam antibiotics, significant differences between the cephalosporins examined were found in respect of certain kinetic parameters. the drugs showed rapid absorption into the systemic circulation after oral administration to pre-ruminating calves but the elimination half-life values (t1/2 beta) varied between three hours (cefaclor and cefadroxil) and nine hours (cefatrizine). the bioavailability of the drugs was about 35 per cent of the administered dose. co-administration of probenecid with each antibiotic caused a twofold or greater  increase in peak serum drug concentrations (cmax) but the effect on t1/2 beta was variable. cephalexin, cephradine and cefaclor given to the ruminating calves resulted in very low serum or plasma concentrations and their use should be restricted to younger calves. cefadroxil was found to give the highest serum concentrations in this age group but had significantly lower bioavailability when compared with the unweaned calves. provisional oral dosage regimens were computed for each cephalosporin on the basis of the mic data and the kinetic parameters derived from intravenous and oral drug administration.

AB  == recombinant plasmids coding for a soluble (or surface) antigen of pasteurella haemolytica a1 were identified. two plasmids, both containing the same 5.4 kilobase pairs of insert dna, were recovered independently by screening a clone band of p. haemolytica a1 genomic dna in escherichia coli for the expression of p. haemolytica a1 soluble antigens (r. y. c. lo and l.a. cameron, can. j. biochem. cell biol. 64:73-76, 1986). e. coli cells carrying the plasmids were found to be agglutinated by an antiserum raised against the p. haemolytica a1 soluble antigens. analysis of the e. coli clones by electron microscopy revealed  patches of amorphous material on the surface of the cells which were not present  on the controls. further characterization with protein a-colloidal gold labeled both these patches and the outer membranes of these cloned cells pretreated with  the specific antiserum. these results indicated that the cloned antigen was expressed on the surface of the e. coli cells. the cloned antigen was found to be specific for serotype 1 when tested by slide agglutination against a collection of p. haemolytica typing antisera. southern blot hybridization, using the cloned  dna as a probe, labeled the genomic dna from p. haemolytica serotype 1 as well as the cross-agglutinating serotypes 2 and 7, but not dna from the non-cross-agglutinating serotypes 3 and 4 and pasteurella multocida. these results demonstrated that serotype specificity could be attributed to the particular antigenic determinants in the genome of the organism.

TI  == clinical pharmacokinetics of flumequine in calves.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of flumequine for 249 salmonella, 126  escherichia coli, and 22 pasteurella multocida isolates recovered from clinical cases of neonatal calf diarrhoea, pneumonia and sudden death was less than or equal to 0.78 microgram/ml. the pharmacokinetics of flumequine in calves was investigated after intravenous (i.v.), intramuscular (i.m.) and oral administration. the two-compartment open model was used for the analysis of serum drug concentrations measured after rapid i.v. ('bolus') injection. the distribution half-life (t1/2 alpha) was 13 min, elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) was 2.25 h, the apparent area volume of distribution (vd(area)), and the volume of distribution at steady state (vd(ss)) were 1.48 and 1.43 l/kg, respectively. flumequine was quickly and completely absorbed into the systemic circulation after i.m. administration of a soluble drug formulation; a mean peak serum drug concentration (cmax) of 6.2 micrograms/ml was attained 30 min after treatment at  10 mg/kg and was similar to the concentration measured 30 min after an equal dose of the drug was injected i.v. on the other hand, the i.m. bioavailability of two  injectable oily suspensions of the drug was 44%; both formulations failed to produce serum drug concentrations of potential clinical significance after administration at 20 mg/kg. the drug was rapidly absorbed after oral administration; the oral bioavailability ranged between 55.7% for the 5 mg/kg dose and 92.5% for the 20 mg/kg dose. concomitant i.m. or oral administration of  probenecid at 40 mg/kg did not change the cmax of the flumequine but slightly decreased its elimination rate. flumequine was 74.5% bound in serum. kinetic data generated from single dose i.v., i.m. and oral drug administration were used to calculate practical dosage recommendations. calculations showed that the soluble  drug formulation should be administered i.m. at 25 mg/kg every 12 h, or alternatively at 50 mg/kg every 24 h. the drug should be administered orally at 30 and 60 mg/kg every 12 and 24 h, respectively. very large, and in our opinion impractical, doses of flumequine formulated as oily suspension are required to produce serum drug concentrations of potential clinical value.

TI  == [aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  == on the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in april 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. they were: bordetella bronchiseptica, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, pasteurella multocida, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus sp., branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus sp., enterobacter agglomerans, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas paucimobilis, pseudomonas diminuta, alcaligenes faecalis and escherichia coli. however, young weaned rabbits were more often pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. the usefulness of performing only pasteurella and bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. it is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.

AB  == from 1940 through 1978, fifty-eight strains of pasteurella multocida (serotype 3) were isolated from turkeys throughout the united states and were examined for r-plasmids. forty-one of the isolates contained plasmid dna, of which 7 isolates  were found to encode resistance to tetracycline, streptomycin, and sulfonamides,  or to streptomycin and sulfonamides. the r-plasmids were 2 to 10 megadaltons, nonconjugal, and contained a moles percent guanine plus cytosine ratio in the range of 57 to 61. the r-plasmids did not belong to any of the 19 incompatibility groups evaluated, including inc q. digestion with restriction endonuclease indicated that 2 of the plasmids from p multocida isolated in 1960 and 1962 were  identical, whereas 4 of the 5 plasmids obtained from p multocida isolated after 1966 were identical, with the 5th plasmid closely related to the other 4. the results indicated that r-plasmids were not widely dispersed among p multocida (serotype 3) isolated from turkeys in the united states. the nontransmissible nature of these plasmids was probably the major reason for their lack of dissemination.

TI  == clinical pharmacology of apramycin in calves.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of apramycin, a unique aminocyclitol  antibiotic, were compared with the mic of dihydrostreptomycin and neomycin for 323 salmonella, 178 escherichia coli and twenty-six pasteurella multocida isolates recovered from newborn calves. apramycin exhibited better in vitro anti-bacterial activity than dihydrostreptomycin and neomycin; isolates of salmonella group b and e. coli resistant to the latter were sensitive to apramycin. the two-compartment open model was appropriate for the analysis of serum apramycin concentrations measured after intravenous (i.v.) administration.  the distribution half-life (t 1/2 alpha) of the drug was 28 min, the elimination  half-life (t 1/2 beta) was 4.4 h, and the apparent volume of distribution (v1) and the distribution volume at steady state (vdss) were 0.34 and 0.71 l/kg, respectively. the drug was quickly and completely absorbed after intramuscular (i.m.) injection; peak serum drug concentrations were directly related to the dose administered, they were obtained 1-2 h after treatment and the i.m. t 1/2 beta was 5 h. there was no evidence of drug accumulation in the serum after three daily i.m. injections at 20 mg/kg. more than 95% of the i.v. and i.m. doses were  recovered in the urine within 96 h post-treatment but the cumulative percentage of drug recovery in the urine after oral treatment was 11%. the durations of free drug concentrations in the tissues after i.v. and i.m. injection were estimated from the serum drug level data, percent of serum protein binding, vdss, t 1/2 beta, and the mic. computations showed that apramycin should be administered i.m. at 20 mg/kg every 24 h in order to maintain in tissues potentially effective drug concentrations sufficient to inhibit 50% of the salmonella, e. coli, and p. multocida isolates, and at 12-h intervals to inhibit 90% of the isolates.

TI  == effect of chlorination on antibiotic resistance profiles of sewage-related bacteria.
AB  == a total of 1,900 lactose-fermenting bacteria were isolated from raw sewage influent and chlorinated sewage effluent from a sewage treatment plant, as well as from chlorinated and neutralized dilute sewage, before and after a 24-h regrowth period in the laboratory. of these isolates, 84% were resistant to one or more antibiotics. chlorination of influent resulted in an increase in the proportion of bacteria resistant to ampicillin and cephalothin, the increase being most marked after regrowth occurred following chlorination. of the other nine antibiotics tested, chlorination resulted in an increased proportion of bacteria resistant to some, but a decrease in the proportion resistant to the remainder. multiple resistance was found for up to nine antibiotics, especially in regrowth populations. identification of about 5% of the isolates showed that the highest proportion of escherichia coli fell in untreated sewage. some rare and potentially pathogenic species were isolated from chlorinated and regrowth samples, including yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pestis, pasteurella multocida, and hafnia alvei. our results indicate that chlorination, while initially lowering the total number of bacteria in sewage, may substantially increase the proportions of antibiotic-resistant, potentially pathogenic organisms.

TI  == immunity to pasteurellosis in compromised rabbits.
AB  == pasteurellosis in the rabbit inoculated with a malignant variant of shope fibroma virus (sfv-mv) is presented as a model for the study of immunosuppression and immunoprophylaxis in pasteurellosis. the rabbits, before the inoculation, were healthy carriers of pasteurella multocida. they were intradermally inoculated with sfv-mv, and 3 to 6 days later, a primary tumor appeared at the site of inoculation. by postinoculation day (pid) 7 or 8, the rabbits had snuffles, conjunctivitis, and tumor metastases; death occurred on pid 10 to 14. rabbits given the nonmalignant patuxent strain of sfv developed local primary tumors, but not pasteurellosis nor metastases. in sfv-mv-inoculated rabbits, there was decreased responsiveness of spleen lymphocytes to b and t cell mitogens by day 6, and of spleen and peripheral blood lymphocytes by day 10. in addition, sfv-mv antigen was detected (by immunofluorescence) in mononuclear phagocytes in all major organs and in epithelial cells of the conjunctiva and nasal mucosa. both nasal and conjunctival epithelia showed squamous metaplasia as well. these changes did not appear in sfv-infected rabbits. with sfv-mv-inoculated rabbits, we obtained partial protection against pasteurellosis by immunization with heat-killed p multocida or a cross-protective core lipopolysaccharide mutant of escherichia coli (j5). rabbits were immunized before the inoculation with sfv-mv  which precipitated "spontaneous" pasteurellosis due to impaired defenses. rabbits immunized with j5 or p multocida had less severe conjunctivitis and snuffles than nonimmunized controls, indicating that immunization with the j5 mutant may be useful as prophylaxis against pasteurellosis in compromised hosts.

TI  == experimental atrophic rhinitis in gnotobiotic pigs.
AB  == twenty-nine caesarian derived colostrum deprived germfree pigs were reared in isolators in groups of three to four per isolator. at seven days of age each group was inoculated intranasally with one of four strains of bordetella bronchiseptica (designated b, j, l and 55b), or pseudomonas aeruginosa or a mucoid strain of escherichia coli, all previously isolated from nasal mucus of pigs affected with clinical atrophic rhinitis. another group was inoculated simultaneously with b. bronchiseptica b and pasteurella multocida. the animals were observed for clinical signs of atrophic rhinitis and monitored bacteriologically at weekly intervals for seven weeks. then they were bled for serology and killed and their respiratory organs examined for gross and histopathological lesions. all of the pigs inoculated with the bordetellae had inflammation of the nasal mucosa and developed positive serum antibody titers against all four of the bordetella strains used in this study. strain j caused sneezing and turbinate atrophy in three of four pigs. one of the three pigs inoculated with strain l died in ten days from bronchopneumonia and pericarditis  and had turbinate atrophy. strains b and b55 caused no turbinate atrophy, but two out of three pigs inoculated with both b. bronchiseptica b and p. multocida had turbinate atrophy. no nasal lesions were observed in the pigs inoculated with e.  coli or p. aeruginosa or in the noninoculated germfree controls. the results indicate a variation in the ability of different strains of b. bronchiseptica to  cause turbinate atrophy in pigs and demonstrate that nasal infections by these organisms stimulate serum antibody response. presence of p. multocida appears to  increase the severity of the lesions. as the e. coli and pseudomonas failed to produce atrophic rhinitis, they are probably of no significance as primary etiological agents in the atrophic rhinitis syndrome in swine.

TI  == microorganisms associated with abscesses of sheep and goats in the south of iran.
AB  == a total of 86 abscesses (45 and 41) abscesses of sheep and goats, respectively) were examined for their causal agents; 44 of these abscesses were located subcutaneously, and the remaining 42 were in lungs, livers, intestines, and udders. a total of 23 different types of microorganisms were isolated from 78 abscesses; bacteria were not detected in the remaining eight abscesses. microorganisms isolated were: species of the genera corynebacterium, staphylococcus, and streptococcus and pasteurella, escherichia coli, and other gram-negative rods. peptostreptococcus anaerobius and eubacterium tortuosum were  isolated in pure culture from one abscess each in goats. two to four different microorganisms were associated with 25 of the 86 abscesses. it was determined that 11 isolates of corynebacterium pyogenes, 2 isolates of pasteurella haemolytica, 1 of p multocida, and 1 of c pseudotuberculosis were lethal to mice. two of the c pyogenes isolates from subcutaneous spreading abscesses of goats were pathogenic for rabbits; these two isolates produced similar suppurative inflammation in goats experimentally, but did not cause death. as determined by experimental inoculation, goats were more susceptible than sheep to the two isolates. in nature, subcutaneous abscesses of goats associated with c pyogenes were of a more diffusive type which resulted in generalization of the infection and death of the animals. postmortem examination of ten goats dying of field infection showed the presence of larvae of the warble-fly przhevalskiana silenus  at the site of infection.

TI  == the effects of laboratory animal diets on the potency tests of bacterial vaccines.
AB  == comparative studies of the responses elicited by mice fed on pcd and ffg diets to a number of bacterial vaccines have shown a significant reduction in the immune response to tetanus toxoid but not to clostridium septicum toxoid and increased resistance to challenge with e. coli and syngeneic tumour cells but not to pasteurella multocida. these differences cannot readily be explained in terms of  differences between the identifiable constituents of the diets and illustrte the  dangers of vaccine potency tests that require an absolute level of response to the material under test.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of 1-hydroxy-1-methyl-1,3-dihydrofuro[3,4-b]quinoxaline 4,9-dioxide and related compounds.
AB  == a free-wilson analysis of the antibacterial activity found in a variety of quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides prepared and tested in these laboratories unexpectedly predicted that potent activity should be found in the case where the heterocyclic ring system was substituted with an acetyl group in the 2 position and a hydroxymethyl group in the 3 position (2). the synthesis and antibacterial activity of this compound, which was actually isolated in the hemiketal form (3), and of several of its derivatives are reported. 1-hydroxy-1-methyl-1,3-dihydrofuro[3,4-b]quinoxaline 4,9-dioxide (3) possesses exceptional activity in vivo against escherichia coli, salmonella choleraesuis, and pasteurella multocida.

TI  == partial characterization of r-plasmids from pasteurella multocida isolated from turkeys.
AB  == pasteurella multocida, isolated from turkeys during an outbreak of septicemic disease ("fowl cholera"), was found to be resistant to tetracycline, streptomycin, and sulfonamides. agarose gel electrophoretic analysis of dna from  these isolates indicated the presence of extrachromosomal elements. plasmid dna was isolated by cesium chloride-ethidium bromide density centrifugation. escherichia coli was transformed to antimicrobic resistance with this dna. two plasmids were isolated. one of these plasmids had a buoyant density of 1.7158 g/cm(3) (56.9 mol% guanine plus cytosine) and a molecular weight of 4.4 x 10(6) and conferred resistance to tetracycline, streptomycin, and sulfonamides. the other, having a buoyant density of 1.7198 g/cm(3) (61 mol% guanine plus cytosine) and a molecular weight of 3.44 x 10(6), conferred resistance to streptomycin and  sulfonamides. streptomycin resistance was mediated by streptomycin phosphotransferase. compatibility group testing indicated that neither plasmid belonged to any of 13 compatibility groups (of conjugal plasmids). both plasmids  were also found to be compatible with three small, nonconjugative resistance plasmids.

AB  == the synthesis, separation, and structure determination of 6- and 7-acetyl--3-methyl-2-quinoxalinecarboxamide 1,4-dioxides are reported together with a comparison of their antibacterial activity. the structural assignment of these 6- and7-acetyl isomers was based on nmr analysis of related mono-n-oxide derivatives, which were obtained by treatment of the quinoxaline 1,4-dioxides with acetic anhydride--acetic acid or trimethyl phosphite. the compounds were screened for in vitro and in vivo activity against escherichia coli, salmonella choleraesuis, pasteurella multocida, and streptococcus pyogenes. although the isomers were found to possess similar activity, the 7-acetyl isomer was more active therapeutically in mice than the 6-acetyl isomer when administered parenterally.

TI  == observation on the bacterial population of the os cervix of the ewe before and after embryo death.
AB  == bacterial samples were isolated from the os cervix of mature merino ewes during a normal oestrous cycle and after colchicine treatment which killed the 25-day old  embryos. the population of bacteria was small during the oestrous cycle and consisted of achromobacter spp. alcaligenes spp, corynebacterium spp, bacillus spp and escherichia coli. there was a significant increase in the numbers of bacteria isolated and a change in the proportions of the bacteria isolated from ewes after embryo death. much greater numbers of potentially pathogenic organisms, including pasteurella multocida, corynebacterium pyogenes, staphylococcus spp and streptococcus spp were isolated after embryos were killed. it is suggested that persistence of potential pathogens in the vagina may impair  fertility in ewes at the first oestrus after embryo death.

TI  == comparative clinical pharmacology of amikacin and kanamycin in dairy calves.
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility of escherichia coli, salmonella sp, pasteurella multocida, and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from young calves and their environment to kanamycin and its semisynthetic derivative--amikacin, was compared by the tube dilution method. the minimal inhibitory concentration of amikacin was two- to fourfold lower than the minimal inhibitory concentration of  kanamycin for the salmonella group b, ps aeruginosa and p multocida strains examined, whereas the e coli and salmonella group d strains were eqaully susceptible to the 2 antibiotics. the concentrations of amikacin and kanamycin in the serum of calves after single intramuscular injections at 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg were determined, and differences between the 2 antibiotics were not observed. intramuscular dosage schedules were calculated, based on the sensitivity of the different bacterial strains and the duration of effective serum drug concentrations.

(among the strains tested so far were streptococci, staphylococci, escherichia coli, pseudomonas, protest, salmonella,, shigella, and haemophilus.)

TI  == acute severe mastitis in cows of the dutch-friesian breed (author's transl).
AB  == one hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. e. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by st. aureus (19%), c. pyogenes (10%), str. dysgalactiae (9%), str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, aerobacter aerogenes, kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and  p. multocida. in several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. the prognosis will vary with the causative organism. treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.

TI  == studies on pasteurella multocida. iii. in vitro assay for cell-mediated immunity.
AB  == peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) from turkeys immunized against fowl cholera with a bacterin or a live avirulent vaccine (strain cs-148) were cultured in vitro with various antigenic preparations from pasteurella multocida (strain p-1059). the degree of lymphocyte stimulation (blastogenesis) was quantitated by  measurement of the uptake of (3h) thymidine. higher stimulation indices were obtained with immune lymphocytes rather than nonimmune lymphocytes. stimulation was specific since pbl from turkeys immunized against p. multocida failed to react with escherichia coli or mycoplasma synoviae antigens. these differences were statistically significant as analyzed with the student's t-test. the lymphocyte transformation assay was emphasized as a convenient and useful in vitro indicator of cell-mediated immunity that should help define the role of cell-mediated immunity in p. multocida infections of turkeys.

TI  == [possible relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune-adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis (author's transl)].
AB  == in the present study we attempted to determine the relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis. as shown in table 1 encapsulated bacteria (klebsiella ozanae, k. pneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, streptococcus pneumoniae), mycoplasma pneumoniae and m. fermentans had a much lower immune adherence-activity than non-encapsulated bacteria (bacillus cereus, brucella abortus, erysipelothrix insidiosa, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, s. typhi). consequently, the former bacteria, in the absece of specific antibodies, activated complement via the c-3-bypass to a smaller extent than the latter. in modified boyden chambers the encapsulated bacteria and the mycoplasmas were much  less cytotaxigenic than the non-encapsulated bacteria (table 3). corresponding to this was the chemotactic response in vivo. finally the rates of phagocytosis were considerably lower with the encapsulated bacteria than with the non-encapsulated  ones (fig. 1).

TI  == effect of active and passive immunizations with lipid a and salmonella minnesota  re 595 on gram-negative infections in mice.
AB  == the capacity of lipid a, a structure common to the lipopolysaccharide cores of all gram-negative bacteria, to serve as an active immunizing agent in mice and to protect these animals against gram-negative infections was investigated. active immunization experiments were also performed with the re mutant of salmonella minnesota 595 which carries a lipopolysaccharide composed of lipid a and three residues of ketodeoxyoctonic acid. single injections of lipid a complexed to acid-hydrolyzed bacteria as carriers failed to induce specific protection against subsequent challenge infections with e. coli o4 and s. breslau. repeated injections of lipid a resulted in good protection against intraperitoneal challenge with s. breslau and partial protection against intravenous challenge with the same organism but did not alter the sensitivity of mice to challenge infections with e. coli or pasteurella multocida. whole antisera or serum fractions from rabbits in which high titers against lipid a had been attained by  repeated intravenous injections of the antigen did not protect mice against challenge infections with e. coli o4. in contrast a single injection of the re mutant of s. minnesota antigen in combination with incomplete freund's adjuvant provided substantial protection against an otherwise lethal intraperitoneal infection with s. breslau over a period of at least 45 days. repeated application of the re antigen resulted in partial protection against experimental infections  with e. coli o4, s. breslau and pasteurella multocida. injections of s. minnesota re 595 antiserum provided better protection against an e. coli o4 infection than  lipid a sera or antibodies of the igg or igm type directed against this antigen.

TI  == diverse effects of bursectomy on humoral immune responses in the chicken.
AB  == chickens bursectomized hormonally or surgically at various ages in embryonic to postembryonic lives were immunized with a mixture of antigens, and the antibodies produced titrated. immune responses to salmonella pullorum (sp), brucella abortus (ba). staphylococcus aureus (staph) and ovalbumin (oa) were more markedly suppressed by the bursal deprivation than those to heterogenous erythrocytes, viruses and such bacteria as pasteurella multocida (pm) and escherichia coli b. the immune response to bovine serum albumin (bsa) was on a level between the two  groups. hormonal bursectomy in embryonic life permitted chickens immunized with sheep red blood cells (srbc) to produce antibody of the igm type but not of the igg type. in surgically bursectomized chickens igg but not igm production was inhibited. chickens hormonally bursectomized on the third day of egg incubation produced igm to a level higher than the normal chickens in contrast with the suppressed igg production. such diversity in the bursal influences on antibody responses was discussed in relation to ontogeny of the humoral immune system.

TI  == carbenicillin indanyl sodium, an orally active derivative of carbenicillin.
AB  == carbenicillin indanyl sodium, an orally active derivative of carbenicillin, is active against a broad spectrum of bacterial species. although the ester has in vitro antimicrobial activity per se when evaluated in brain heart infusion broth, the in vivo antibacterial activity seen in mice and rats reflects primarily the efficient hydrolysis of the ester to carbenicillin. with an acute systemic infection in mice as a test system, orally administered carbenicillin indanyl sodium protected mice against lethal infections produced by escherichia coli, salmonella choleraesuis, pasteurella multocida, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus  aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. the dose that protected 50% of the animals against each of these infections was comparable to that of parenteral carbenicillin. against experimental urinary-tract disease in rats produced by e.  coli, p. vulgaris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, it was again observed that carbenicillin indanyl sodium provided activity comparable to that of parenterally administered carbenicillin.

AB  == respiratory disease in a dynamic colony of nonhuman primates during a 4-year period was due primarily to infections caused by klebsiella pneumoniae, diplococcus pneumoniae, bordetella bronchiseptica, pasteurella multocida, and haemophilus influenzae. the principal secondary invaders were escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococci. a high fatality rate was associated with infections caused by each of the primary pathogens, and females appeared to be more susceptible than males. incidence of respiratory disease was greatest in the fall and early winter; however, at all times newly colonized monkeys had a higher infection rate than conditioned monkeys. infections were occasionally confined only to the lungs and were sometimes present without grossly observable lung lesions. the information given on susceptibility of 10 species of nonhuman primates to respiratory infections provides a basis for developing disease models.

AB  == sixteen cows were used in a series of experiments to test dose, route and frequency responses in the production of milk and serum agglutinins to a spectrum of 9 proven bovine pathogens. the bacterial species were: pasteurella multocida (2 isolates), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus albus, streptococcus sp., corynebacterium sp., salmonella enteriditis, and aerobacter aerogenes. primary immunizations were made either through the teat canal or intramuscularly. "booster" injections were made through the teat canal. agglutinins in the blood appeared only after a week or more. in the milk, titers  were recorded in 1 or 2 days following primary immunization. variation of titer in the blood and milk was somewhat independent. in all but 1 cow, antibody was produced against each organism in milk and blood serum. udder inflammation was observed in the experiments when a 15-day interval separated immunizations. inflammation was minimal in the experiments employing the 7-day interval of immunization. a positive whiteside test was observed following most injections, even where no other clinical signs of reaction were seen. the findings are discussed in relation to the previous literature.
