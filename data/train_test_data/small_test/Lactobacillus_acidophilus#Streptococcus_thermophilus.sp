TI  == proteolytic and ace-inhibitory activities of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria as affected by different levels of fat, inulin and starter culture.
AB  == in this study, the effects of fat (0.5 %, 3.2 % and 5.0 %), inulin (0.0 and 1.0 %) and starter culture (0.0 %, 0.5 %, 1.0 % and 1.5 %) on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ace)-inhibitory activity of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria were assessed. proteolytic activities of bacteria were also investigated. yogurts were prepared either using a sole yogurt commercial culture including streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus or bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 and lactobacillus acidophilus la5 in addition to yogurt culture. relative degrees of proteolysis were found to be considerably higher in yogurt samples than uht milk as the control. both regular  and probiotic yogurts showed considerable ace-inhibitory activities. results showed that degree of proteolysis was not influenced by different fat contents, while was increased by high concentration of starter culture (1.5 % w/w) and reduced by inulin (1 % w/w). ace-inhibitory activities of yogurt were also negatively affected by the presence of inulin and high levels of fat (5 % w/w). moreover, yogurt containing probiotic bacteria showed higher inhibitory against ace in comparison to the yogurt prepared with non-probiotic strains.

TI  == the effects of probiotics and prebiotics on the fatty acid profile and conjugated linoleic acid content of fermented cow milk.
AB  == the ability of probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus la5 and bifidobacterium animalis bb12), to produce conjugated linoleic acid (cla) in association with streptococcus thermophilus and lb. bulgaricus during milk fermentation has been evaluated in this study. pasteurized cow milk and infant formula were used. infant formula was selected for its high linoleic acid content, for being a source of cla and for its prebiotic compounds, e.g. galacto-oligosaccharides. the microorganisms were not able to increase the cla content of the fermented products under the given experimental conditions. no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) occurred between the cla content in milk and the fermented samples. the cla contents of 10 commercial fermented milk products were determined. the highest cla content was observed in fermented  milk containing only str. thermophilus and lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == plant extract enhances the viability of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus acidophilus in probiotic nonfat yogurt.
AB  == a commercial plant extract (prepared from olive, garlic, onion and citrus extracts with sodium acetate (sa) as a carrier) was evaluated to extend the viability of yogurt starter and probiotic bacteria as a means to enhance the shelf life of live and active culture, probiotic nonfat yogurt. yogurts prepared  from three different formulas (0.5* plant extract, 0.25* sa, or no supplement) and cultures (yogurt starter plus bifidobacterium animalis,lactobacillus acidophilus, or both probiotics) were assessed weekly during 29 days of storage at 5 degrees c. supplemented yogurt mixes had greater buffering capacities than non-supplemented yogurt mixes. at the end of storage, lactobacillus bulgaricus and l. acidophilus counts in supplemented yogurts were greater compared with non-supplemented yogurts. supplementation did not affect streptococcus thermophilus and b. animalis counts. hence the greater buffering capacity of yogurt containing plant extract could enhance the longevity of the probiotics, l. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus, during storage.

TI  == construction and validation of a mcherry protein vector for promoter analysis in  lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == lactobacilli are widespread in natural environments and are increasingly being investigated as potential health modulators. in this study, we have adapted the broad-host-range vector pnz8048 to express the mcherry protein (prcr) to expand the usage of the mcherry protein for analysis of gene expression in lactobacillus. this vector is also able to replicate in streptococcus pneumoniae  and escherichia coli. the usage of prcr as a promoter probe was validated in lactobacillus acidophilus by characterizing the regulation of lactacin b expression. the results show that the regulation is exerted at the transcriptional level, with lbab gene expression being specifically induced by co-culture of the l. acidophilus bacteriocin producer and the s. thermophilus sty-31 inducer bacterium.

TI  == use of probiotics to reduce faecal shedding of shiga toxin-producing escherichia  coli in sheep.
AB  == shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) are zoonotic, foodborne pathogens of humans. ruminants, including sheep, are the primary reservoirs of stec and there is a need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the entry of stec into the food chain. the initiation of the majority of bacterial, enteric infections involves colonisation of the gut mucosal surface by the pathogen. however, probiotic bacteria can serve to decrease the severity of infection via a number of mechanisms including competition for receptors and nutrients, and/or the synthesis of organic acids and bacteriocins that create an environment unfavourable for pathogen development. the aim of the current study was to determine whether the administration of a probiotic mixture to sheep experimentally infected with a non-o157 stec strain, carrying stx1, stx2 and eae  genes, was able to decrease faecal shedding of the pathogen. the probiotic mixture contained lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. the numbers of non-o157 stec in faecal samples collected from sheep receiving daily doses of the probiotic mixture were significantly lower at the 3rd, 5th and 6th week post-inoculation when compared to the levels recorded in untreated animals. it was concluded that administration of the probiotic mixture reduced faecal shedding of non-o157 stec in sheep, and holds potential as a pre-harvest intervention method to reduce transmission to humans.

TI  == local probiotic therapy for vaginal candida albicans infections.
AB  == the high rate of vaginal candida albicans recurrence is attributed to azole resistance rates as high as 15 %. the aim of this study was to determine the clinical and microbiological efficacy of standard azole therapy for treatment of  vaginal c. albicans infection alone and in combination with local probiotic as well as the effects on vaginal microbiota. this study included 436 women with vaginal candidiasis randomly assigned to two treatment groups. the first group, with 207 patients (12 dropouts), was administered 150 mg fluconazole and a single vaginal globule of fenticonazole (600 mg) on the same day. the second group of 209 patients (8 dropouts) followed the same treatment schedule; however, ten applications of a vaginal probiotic containing lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus were  also administered beginning the fifth day after azole treatment. microbiological  analysis of the therapy efficacy in the first treatment group showed c. albicans  resistance in over 30 % of patients. clinical complaints persisted after treatment administration in 79.7 % (n = 165) of women in this group. clinical complaints in the second group decreased to 31.1 % (n = 65) and microbiological efficacy also improved among investigated parameters, from 93.7 % (n = 193) to 95.2 % (n = 198). the local application of probiotics after administration of combined azoles for treatment of vaginal c. albicans infections increases therapy efficacy and could prevent relapse.

TI  == short-term probiotic therapy alleviates small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, but does not improve intestinal permeability in chronic liver disease.
AB  == aim: : although numerous animal studies suggest that probiotic therapy has beneficial effects in various liver diseases, the evidence for beneficial effects in human liver disease is controversial. this study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) and permeability in chronic liver disease. methods: fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo. six bacterial species were used: bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and streptococcus thermophilus. after 4 weeks, changes in the composition of fecal bacteria, sibo, intestinal permeability, and clinical symptoms were examined. results: three of the six probiotic species, b. lactis, l. rhamnosus, and l. acidophilus, increased in the  feces of the probiotic therapy group (p<0.001), whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group. sibo disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group, but none in the placebo (24 vs. 0%, p<0.05). general gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm (50 vs. 31.3%, p=0.248). numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability (p for trend<0.05). liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group. conclusions: we conclude that short-term probiotic administration in chronic liver disease is effective in alleviating sibo and clinical symptoms,  but ineffective in improving intestinal permeability and liver function.

TI  == short communication: viability of culture organisms in honey-enriched acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (abt)-type fermented camel milk.
AB  == the aim of this research was to monitor the survival during refrigerated storage  of lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 (a), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 (b), and streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 (t) in cultured dairy foods made from camel and, for comparison, cow milks supplemented with black locust (robinia pseudoacacia l.) honey and fermented by an acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (abt)-type culture. two liters of dromedary camel milk and 2 l of cow milk were heated to 90 degrees c and held for 10 min, then cooled to 40 degrees c. one half of both types of milk was fortified with black locust honey at the rate of 5.0% (wt/vol), whereas the other half was devoid of honey and served as a control. the camel and cow milks with and without honey were subsequently inoculated with abt-5 culture and were fermented at 37 degrees c until a ph value of 4.6 was reached. thereafter, the probiotic fermented milks were cooled to 15 degrees c in ice water and were each separated  into 18 fractions that were transferred in sterile, tightly capped centrifuge tubes. after 24 h of cooling at 8 degrees c (d 0), the samples were stored at refrigeration temperature (4 degrees c). three tubes of all 4 products (i.e., fermented camel and cow milks with and without honey) were taken at each sampling time (i.e., following 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d of storage), and the counts of characteristic microorganisms and those of certain spoilage microbes (yeasts, molds, coliforms, escherichia coli) were enumerated. the entire experimental program was repeated twice. the results showed that addition of black locust honey at 5% to heat-treated camel and cow milks did not influence the growth and  survival of starter streptococci during production and subsequent refrigerated storage of fermented abt milks. in contrast, honey improved retention of viability of b. animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 in the camel milk-based product during storage at 4 degrees c up to 5 wk. no spoilage organisms were detected in any of  the samples tested in this study. in conclusion, supplementation of cultured dairy foods, especially those made from camel milk, with honey is recommended because honey is a healthy natural sweetener with a variety of beneficial microbiological, nutritional, and sensory properties.

TI  == cell growth and proteolytic activity of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus  helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus in milk as affected by supplementation with peptide fractions.
AB  == the present investigation examined the effects of supplementation of milk peptide fractions produced by enzymatic hydrolysis on the fermentation of reconstituted skim milk (rsm). changes in ph, cell growth, proteolytic activity, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace)-inhibitory activity were monitored during fermentation of rsm by pure cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus  helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus. the study showed that supplementation with peptide fractions of different molecular weights did not significantly affect the bacterial growth in  rsm. all bacteria showed an increased proteolytic activity in rsm supplemented with large peptides (>10 kda), and l. helveticus in general exhibited the highest proteolytic activity among the bacteria studied. the ace-inhibitory activity was  observed to be the maximum in rsm supplemented with larger peptides (>10 kda) for all bacteria. the results suggest that proteolysis by bacteria leads to increased production of ace-inhibitory peptides compared to the supplemented peptides produced by enzymatic hydrolysis.

TI  == synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == aim: infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. in a randomised clinical  trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. methods: fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion cfu of: lactobacillus casei, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, l. acidophilus, b. infantis, l. bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (protexin healthcare, somerset, uk), or placebo daily for 30 days. parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. the primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). results: the treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic  group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (p < 0.005). at day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (p < 0.01). symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (p < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, p = 0.24). we encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. conclusion: this synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus fos) significantly improved  colic symptoms in comparison with placebo.

TI  == effect of green tea supplementation on the microbiological, antioxidant, and sensory properties of probiotic milks.
AB  == green tea and its constituents are known for a wide range of health-promoting properties. they may exert antimicrobial action but without altering lactic acid  bacteria. the aim of the present study was to estimate the effect of green tea addition on the selected properties of probiotic milks. bioyogurts (fermented with abt-1 coculture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12) and acidophilus milks (fermented with pure l. acidophilus la-5 culture) with addition of 0, 5, 10, or 15% (v/v) green tea infusion (gti) were produced and analyzed for the antioxidant capacity by the "diphenyl picrylhydrazyl" (dpph) and "ferric-reducing antioxidant power" (frap) methods, acidity, the count of starter bacteria, and sensory properties at the 1st, 7th, 14th, and 21st day of cold storage. the 15% addition  of gti to the acidophilus milk significantly reduced the lactic acid production during the whole study. the gti had no impact on the level of s. thermophilus and b. lactis bb-12 in bioyogurts, and its effect on the count of l. acidophilus la-5 depended on the concentration and probiotic milk type. gti similarly and in a dose-dependent manner enhanced the antioxidant capacity of both milk types. there were no significant differences between the sensory notes received for bioyogurts, whereas acidophilus milks with tea were less appreciated by the panelists. in conclusion, green tea could be successfully used as a functional additive for selected probiotic milks enhancing their health benefits, but the proper selection of tea additive and starter culture is recommended.

TI  == probiotic viability and storage stability of yogurts and fermented milks prepared with several mixtures of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == currently, the food industry wants to expand the range of probiotic yogurts but each probiotic bacteria offers different and specific health benefits. little information exists on the influence of probiotic strains on physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of yogurts and fermented milks. six probiotic yogurts or fermented milks and 1 control yogurt were prepared, and we evaluated several physicochemical properties (ph, titratable acidity, texture, color, and syneresis), microbial viability of starter cultures (lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) and probiotics (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus reuteri) during fermentation and storage (35 d at 5 degrees c), as well as sensory preference among them. decreases in ph (0.17 to 0.50 units) and increases in titratable acidity (0.09 to 0.29%) were observed during storage. only the yogurt  with s. thermophilus, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and l. reuteri differed in  firmness. no differences in adhesiveness were determined among the tested yogurts, fermented milks, and the control. syneresis was in the range of 45 to 58%. no changes in color during storage were observed and no color differences were detected among the evaluated fermented milk products. counts of s. thermophilus decreased from 1.8 to 3.5 log during storage. counts of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus also decreased in probiotic yogurts and varied from 30 to 50% of initial population. probiotic bacteria also lost viability throughout storage, although the 3 probiotic fermented milks maintained counts >/= 10(7)cfu/ml for 3 wk. probiotic bacteria had variable viability in yogurts, maintaining counts of l. acidophilus >/= 10(7) cfu/ml for 35 d, of l. casei for 7d, and of l. reuteri for 14 d. we found no significant sensory preference among  the 6 probiotic yogurts and fermented milks or the control. however, the yogurt and fermented milk made with l. casei were better accepted. this study presents relevant information on physicochemical, sensory, and microbial properties of probiotic yogurts and fermented milks, which could guide the dairy industry in developing new probiotic products.

TI  == lactose digestion from yogurt: mechanism and relevance.
AB  == yogurt is traditionally consumed throughout the world among populations who are seemingly unable to digest lactose. this review provides a historical overview of the studies that show lactose digestion and tolerance from yogurt by lactose-intolerant people. the lactose in yogurt is digested more efficiently than other dairy sources of lactose because the bacteria inherent in yogurt assist with its digestion. the bacterial lactase survives the acidic conditions of the stomach, apparently being physically protected within the bacterial cells  and facilitated by the buffering capacity of yogurt. the increasing ph as the yogurt enters the small intestine and a slower gastrointestinal transit time allow the bacterial lactase to be active, digesting lactose from yogurt sufficiently to prevent symptoms in lactose-intolerant people. there is little difference in the lactase capability of different commercial yogurts, because they apparently contain lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus in sufficient quantities (10(8) bacteria/ml). however, lactobacillus acidophilus  appears to require cell membrane disruption to physically release the lactase. compared with unflavored yogurts, flavored yogurts appear to exhibit somewhat reduced lactase activity but are still well tolerated.

TI  == short communication: survival of the characteristic microbiota in probiotic fermented camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks during refrigerated storage.
AB  == the objective of this study was to monitor the viability during storage of lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 (a), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 (b), and streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 (t) in probiotic cultured dairy foods made from pasteurized camel, cow, goat, and sheep milks fermented by an abt-type culture. the products manufactured were stored at 4 degrees c for 42d. microbiological analyses were performed at weekly intervals. streptococcus thermophilus chcc 742/2130 was the most numerous culture component in all 4 products both at the beginning and at the end of storage. the viable counts of streptococci showed no significant decline in fermented camel milk throughout the entire storage period. the initial numbers of lb. acidophilus la-5 were over 2 orders of magnitude lower than those of strep. thermophilus chcc 742/2130. with the progress of time, a slow and constant decrease was observed in lactobacilli counts; however, the final viability percentages of this organism did not differ  significantly in the probiotic fermented milks tested. the cultured dairy foods made from cow, sheep, and goat milks had comparable b. animalis ssp. lactis bb-12 counts on d 0, exceeding by approximately 0.5 log10 cycle those in the camel milk-based product. no significant losses occurred in viability of bifidobacteria in fermented camel, cow, and sheep milks during 6wk of refrigerated storage. in conclusion, all 4 varieties of milk proved to be suitable raw materials for the manufacture of abt-type fermented dairy products that were microbiologically safe and beneficial for human consumption. it was suggested that milk from small ruminants be increasingly used to produce probiotic fermented dairy foods. the development of camel milk-based probiotic cultured milks appears to be even more  promising because new markets could thus be conquered. it must be emphasized, however, that further microbiological and sensory studies, technology development activities, and market research are needed before such food products can be successfully commercialized.

TI  == effect of bacterial cell-free supernatants on infectivity of norovirus surrogates.
AB  == bacterial metabolic products were evaluated for inhibitory effects on viral propagation in cell culture. cell-free supernatants (cfs) were prepared from growth of enterococcus faecalis atcc 19433, pseudomonas fluorescens atcc 13525, escherichia coli 08, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, bacillus subtilis 168, bacillus coagulans 185a, b. coagulans 7050, clostridium sporogenes pa3679, and a commercial probiotic mixture of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus salivarius, and streptococcus thermophilus in microbiological medium or milk. the inhibitory effects of cfs on  the propagation of murine norovirus 1 and tulane virus in raw 264.7 and llcmk2 cells, respectively, were evaluated in the continuous presence of cfs or after exposure of host cells to cfs. slight inhibition of viral propagation was observed for murine norovirus and tulane virus in the continuous presence of cfs  of b. subtilis 168 and e. faecalis 19433, respectively. cfs cytotoxicity was also determined by microscopic examination. virus persisted in the cfs that demonstrated cytotoxic effects, suggesting a lack of direct effect of cfs on virions. the viral propagation indicates a general lack of competitive inhibition by bacterial extracellular products and bears significance in understanding the persistence of virus in food and human systems shared by bacteria that are recognized for their colonization and competitive capabilities.

TI  == [identification of lactic acid bacteria in commercial yogurt and their antibiotic resistance].
AB  == objective: to identify lactic acid bacteria (lab) in commercial yogurts and investigate their antibiotic resistance. methods: labs were cultured from 5 yogurt brands and the isolates were identified at the species level by 16s rrna sequence. genotyping was performed by repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr (rep-pcr). the sensitivity to 7 antibiotics was tested for all lab isolates by kirby-bauer paper diffusion (k-b method). meanwhile, 9 antibiotic resistance genes (args), including erythromycin resistance genes (erma and ermb) and tetracycline resistance genes (tetm, tetk, tets, tetq, teto, tetl and tetw), were detected by pcr amplification in the identified lab isolates. the pcr products were confirmed by sequencing. results: total 100 labs were isolated, including 23 lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, 26 lactobacillus casei, 30 streptococcus thermophilus, 5 lactobacillus acidophilus, 6 lactobacillus plantarum, and 10 lactobacillus paracasei. the drug susceptibility test shows that all 100 isolates were resistant to gentamicin and streptomycin, 42 isolates  were resistant to vancomycin, and on the contrary all were sensitive to cefalexin, erythromycin, tetracycline and oxytetracycline. moreover, 5 args were  found in the 28 sequencing confirmed isolates, ermb gene was detected in 8 isolates, tet k in 4 isolates, tetl in 2 isolates, tetm in 4 isolates, teto in 2  isolates. erm a, tet s, tet q and tet w genes were not detected in the isolates.  antibiotic resistance genes were found in 53.57% (15/28) sequenced isolates, 2 -3 antibiotic resistance genes were detected in 4 isolates of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. conclusions: some labs were not labeled in commercial yogurt products. antibiotic resistance genes tend to be found in the starter culture of  l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus. all the lab isolates were sensitive to erythromycin and tetracycline, even though some carried erythromycin and/or tetracycline resistance genes. we proved again that lab could carry antibiotic resistance gene(s) though it is sensitive to antibiotics.

TI  == evaluation of probiotic survivability in yogurt exposed to cold chain interruption.
AB  == in this research, the survival of probiotic microorganisms in yogurts stored at room temperature (cold chain interruption conditions) was studied. milk inoculated with yogurt bacteria (mixed culture of streptococcus thermophilus and  lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus) and a single probiotic culture (l. acidophilus la-5 or bifidobacterium lactis bb- 12 or l. rhamnosus hn001 or l. paracasei lpc-37) were incubated till ph of 4.5 was reached. probiotic yogurts were stored at two different temperatures including cold (control) and room temperatures (5 and 20 degrees c, respectively). changes in ph decrease, titratable acidity increase and redox potential increase as well as the viability of probiotics per 6 h intervals during an assumptive interrupted cold storage (24 h) were monitored. the survival of probiotics was strongly dependent on the storage temperature and remarkable viability loss occurred in room temperature compared to refrigerated storage. in addition, the survivability was dependent on probiotic strain. among our experimental strains, b. lactis bb-12 showed the less resistance to be stored at 20 degrees c (24 h) and referring to the recommended minimum numbers of 10(7) cfu ml(-) (1), l. rhamnosus hn001 was the most suitable  probiotic strain to be used in probiotic yogurts especially in countries having high possibility of cold chain interruption during storage.

TI  == effect of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: we are aware of no study that has indicated the effects of daily consumption of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp), and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. objective: this study was designed to determine the effects of multispecies probiotic supplements on metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. methods: this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed on 54 diabetic patients aged 35-70 years. subjects were randomly assigned to take either a multispecies probiotic supplement (n = 27) or placebo (n = 27) for 8 weeks. the multispecies probiotic supplement consisted of 7 viable and freeze-dried strains: lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) cfu), l. casei (7 x 10(9) cfu), l. rhamnosus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), l. bulgaricus (2 x 10(8) cfu), bifidobacterium breve (2 x 10(10) cfu), b. longum (7 x 10(9) cfu), streptococcus thermophilus (1.5 x 10(9) cfu), and 100 mg fructo-oligosaccharide. fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after intervention to measure metabolic profiles, hs-crp, and biomarkers of oxidative stress including plasma total antioxidant capacity and total glutathione (gsh). results: between-group comparisons of fasting plasma glucose (fpg) revealed that consumption of probiotic supplements prevented a rise in fpg (+28.8 +/- 8.5 for placebo vs. +1.6 +/- 6 mg/dl for probiotic group, p = 0.01). although a significant within-group increase in serum insulin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was found in both the probiotic group  and the placebo group, the changes were similar between the two groups. we observed a significant increase in homa-ir (homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance) in both the probiotic group (p = 0.02) and the placebo group (p = 0.001); however, the increase in the placebo group was significantly higher than that in the probiotic group (+2.38 vs. +0.78, p = 0.03). mean changes in serum hs-crp were significantly different between the two  groups (-777.57 for the probiotic group vs. +878.72 ng/ml for the placebo group,  p = 0.02). probiotic supplementation led to a significant increase in plasma gsh  levels compared to placebo (240.63 vs. -33.46 micromol/l, p = 0.03). conclusion:  in conclusion, multispecies probiotic supplementation, compared with placebo, for 8 weeks in diabetic patients prevented a rise in fpg and resulted in a decrease in serum hs-crp and an increase in plasma total gsh.

TI  == the influence of sweeteners in probiotic petit suisse cheese in concentrations equivalent to that of sucrose.
AB  == as in the case of probiotic functional foods in recent years, demand has increased notably for light or diet foods with added sweeteners. however, little  is known about the effect of different sweeteners on the microorganisms present.  thus, the objective of the current study was to establish the ideal sucrose concentration and equivalent concentrations of different sweeteners and to determine, by microbiological analyses, the influence of these compounds on the viability of the starter and probiotic cultures used in the production of strawberry-flavored petit suisse cheese during its shelf life. the ideal sucrose  concentration was determined using the just-about-right (jar) scale, and the equivalent concentrations of the sweeteners were subsequently determined by the magnitude estimation method. microbiological analyses were also carried out to check the viability of the cultures during the product's shelf life. the results  showed that the compounds neotame (nutrasweet, chicago, il) and stevia presented, respectively, the greatest and least sweetening power of the sweeteners tested. none of the sweeteners used in this study exerted a negative effect on the viability of the starter or probiotic cultures, and thus we were able to obtain a probiotic, functional food with reduced calorie content.

TI  == incorporation of soybean by-product okara and inulin in a probiotic soy yoghurt:  texture profile and sensory acceptance.
AB  == background: this study evaluated the effect of inulin and okara flour on textural and sensory properties of probiotic soy yoghurt (sy) throughout 28 days of storage at 4 degrees c. employing a 2(2) design, four formulations of sy produced from soymilk and fermented with an abt-4 culture (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 and streptococcus thermophilus) were studied: sy-c (control); sy-i (with inulin); sy-o (with okara); sy-io (with inulin + okara). results: the addition of okara and the refrigerated storage led to significant differences in the instrumental texture parameters of sy (p < 0.05). inulin and okara did not affect sy sensory acceptability (p > 0.05), but there was a tendency for higher scores in the presence of inulin. on the other hand, the storage period, particularly at 21 days, was unfavourable regarding the acceptance of the different sy. conclusion: the results showed that the addition  of okara flour and the storage were significant factors to increase firmness of the soy yoghurts. sy acceptability was not affected by the incorporation of inulin or okara. these results suggest that okara, discarded as industrial waste, may be used in probiotic soy yoghurt, helping to increase the nutritional and functional properties without altering its acceptability.

TI  == impact of inulin and okara on lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium  animalis bb-12 viability in a fermented soy product and probiotic survival under  in vitro simulated gastrointestinal conditions.
AB  == the effect of inulin and/or okara flour on lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 and bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 viability in a fermented soy product (fsp) and on  probiotic survival under in vitro simulated gastrointestinal conditions were investigated throughout 28 days of storage at 4 degrees c. employing a 2(2) design, four fsp trials were produced from soymilk fermented with abt-4 culture (la-5, bb-12, and streptococcus thermophilus): fsp (control); fsp-i (with inulin, 3 g/100 ml of soymilk); fsp-o (with okara, 5 g/100 ml); fsp-io (with inulin + okara, ratio 3:5 g/100 ml). probiotic viabilities ranged from 8 to 9 log cfu/g during the 28 days of storage, and inulin and/or okara flour did not affect the viability of la-5 and bb-12. bb-12 resistance to the artificial gastrointestinal  juices was higher than for la-5, since the bb-12 and la-5 populations decreased approximately 0.6 log cfu/g and 3.8 log cfu/g, respectively, throughout storage period. even though the protective effect of inulin and/or okara flour on probiotic microorganisms was not significant, when compared to a fresh culture, the fsp matrix improved bb-12 survival on day 1 of storage and may be considered  a good vehicle for bb-12 and could play an important role in probiotic protection against gastrointestinal juices.

TI  == antioxidant properties of potentially probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo activities.
AB  == thirty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria (seven bifidobacterium, 11 lactobacillus, six lactococcus, and 10 streptococcus thermophilus) were assayed in vitro for antioxidant activity against ascorbic and linolenic acid oxidation (taa(aa) and taa(la)), trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (teac), intracellular glutathione (tgsh), and superoxide dismutase (sod). wide dispersion of each of taa(aa), taa(la), teac, tgsh, and sod occurred within bacterial groups, indicating that antioxidative properties are strain specific. the strains bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis dsmz 23032, lactobacillus acidophilus dsmz 23033, and lactobacillus brevis dsmz 23034 exhibited among the highest taa(aa), taa(la), teac, and tgsh values within the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. these  strains were used to prepare a potentially antioxidative probiotic formulation, which was administered to rats at the dose of 10(7), 10(8), and 10(9) cfu/day for 18 days. the probiotic strains colonized the colon of the rats during the trial and promoted intestinal saccharolytic metabolism. the analysis of plasma antioxidant activity, reactive oxygen molecules level, and glutathione concentration, revealed that, when administered at doses of at least 10(8) cfu/day, the antioxidant mixture effectively reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress. probiotic strains which are capable to limit excessive amounts  of reactive radicals in vivo may contribute to prevent and control several diseases associated with oxidative stress.

TI  == diversity in growth and protein degradation by dairy relevant lactic acid bacteria species in reconstituted whey.
AB  == the high nutritional value of whey makes it an interesting substrate for the development of fermented foods. the aim of this work was to evaluate the growth and proteolytic activity of sixty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria in whey to further formulate a starter culture for the development of fermented whey-based beverages. fermentations were performed at 37 degrees c for 24 h in 10 and 16% (w/v) reconstituted whey powder. cultivable populations, ph, and proteolytic activity (o-phthaldialdehyde test) were determined at 6 and 24 h incubation. hydrolysis of whey proteins was analysed by tricine sds-page. a principal component analysis (pca) was applied to evaluate the behaviour of strains. forty-six percent of the strains grew between 1 and 2 deltalog cfu/ml while 19% grew less than 0.9 deltalog cfu/ml in both reconstituted whey solutions. regarding the proteolytic activity, most of the lactobacilli released amino acids and small peptides during the first 6 h incubation while streptococci consumed the amino acids initially present in whey to sustain growth. whey proteins were degraded by the studied strains although to different extents. special attention  was paid to the main allergenic whey protein, beta-lactoglobulin, which was degraded the most by lactobacillus acidophilus crl 636 and lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 656. the strain variability observed and the pca applied in this study allowed selecting appropriate strains able to improve the nutritional characteristics (through amino group release and protein degradation) and storage (decrease in ph) of whey.

TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

AB  == probiotics have been extensively studied over the past several years in the prevention and, to a larger extent, in the treatment of diarrheal diseases, especially in pediatric populations. diarrhea is a symptom, and not a disease. this review will not address chronic disorders associated with diarrhea, or clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea. rather it will focus on published clinical trials performed on acute-onset, likely infectious diarrhea occurring in the settings of day-care centers, in the community, acquired in the hospital, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and treatment of acute infectious diarrhea. for prevention of diarrhea acquired in day-care centers, 9 randomized and placebo-controlled trials have been published, conducted in different parts of the world. probiotics tested were lactobacillus gg, bifidobacterium lactis (alone or in combination with streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus (not gg), and lactobacillus acidophilus, in various trials either alone or in comparison with each other. the evidence of their efficacy in these settings is only modest for the prevention of diarrhea, although somewhat better for prevention of upper respiratory infections. in the community, new trails conducted in underprivileged areas of india, again with modest efficacy. previous trials that examined the potential role of probiotics in preventing the spreading of diarrhea in hospitalized children had yielded conflicting results. more recently, a large trial in poland showed, however, rather good evidence of efficacy for lactobacillus gg. the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea has been the subject of many investigations, both  in children and in adults. most commonly used probiotics were lactobacillus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium ssp, streptococcus ssp, and the yeast saccharomyces boulardii. in general, most of these trials do show clear evidence of efficacy, with the 2 most effective strains being lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii. evidence is also emerging on the importance of the dose in reducing the incidence of this type of diarrhea, and the incidence of clostridium difficile-associated postantibiotic diarrhea. as for treatment, a large body of data is available, especially in children, on the effect of several strains of probiotics in treating sporadic infectious diarrhea. the vast majority of the published trials show a statistically significant benefit and moderate clinical benefit of a few, well-identified probiotic strains-mostly lactobacillus gg and s. boulardii-in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea, and particularly those due to rotavirus. such a beneficial effect results, on average, in a reduction of diarrhea duration of approximately 1 day.  the effect is strain-dependent and dose-dependent.

TI  == a novel biosensor based on lactobacillus acidophilus for determination of phenolic compounds in milk products and wastewater.
AB  == different branches of industry need to use phenolic compounds (pcs) in their production, so determination of pcs sensitively, accurately, rapidly, and economically is very important. for the sensitive determination of pcs, some biosensors based on pure polyphenol oxidase, plant tissue and microorganisms were developed before. but there has been no study to develop a microbial phenolic compounds biosensor based on lactobacillus species, which contain polyphenol oxidase enzyme. in this study, we used different forms of lactobacillus species as enzyme sources of biosensor and compared biosensor performances of these forms for determination of pcs. for this purpose, we used lyophilized lactobacillus cells (containing l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus), pure l. acidophilus, pure l. bulgaricus, and l. acidophilus- and l. bulgaricus adapted to catechol in lactobacilli mrs broth. the most suitable form was determined and optimization studies of the biosensor were carried out by using this form. for preparing the bioactive layer of the biosensor, the lactobacillus  cells were immobilized in gelatin by using glutaraldehyde. in the study, we used  catechol as a substrate. phenolic compound determination is based on the assay of the differences on the respiration activity of the cells on the oxygen meter in the absence and the presence of catechol. the microbial biosensor response depends directly on catechol concentration between 0.5 and 5.0 mm with 18 min response time. in the optimization studies of the microbial biosensor the most suitable microorganism amount was found to be 10 mg, and also phosphate buffer (ph 8.0; 50 mm) and 37.5 degrees c were obtained as the optimum working conditions. in the characterization studies of the microbial biosensor some parameters such as substrate specificity on the biosensor response and operational and storage stability were examine. furthermore, the determination of pc levels in synthetic wastewater, industrial wastewater, and milk products was investigated by using the developed biosensor under optimum conditions.

TI  == utilization of uf-permeate for production of beta-galactosidase by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == four lactobacilli strains (lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacilus casei and lactobacillus reuteri) were grown in mrs broth and three lactococci strains (streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis  and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetilactis) were grown in m17 broth. l. reuteri and s. thermophilus were chosen on the basis of the best mean beta-galactosidase activity of 10.44 and 10.01 u/ml respectively, for further studies on permeate-based medium. the maximum production of beta-galactosidase by l. reuteri was achieved at lactose concentration of 6%, initial ph 5.0-7.5, ammonium phosphate as nitrogen source at a concentration of 0.66 g n/l and incubation temperature at 30 degrees c/24 hrs to give 6.31 u/ml. while in case of s. thermophilus, maximum beta-galactosidase production was achieved at 10% lactose concentration of permeate medium, supplemented with phosphate buffer ratio of 0.5:0.5 (kh2po4:k2hpo4, g/l), at initial ph 6.0-6.5, ammonium phosphate  (0.66g n/l) as nitrogen source and incubation temperature 35 degrees c for 24 hrs to give 7.85 u/ml.

TI  == effect of grape polyphenols on lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria growth: resistance and metabolism.
AB  == food polyphenols are able to selectively modify the growth of susceptible micro-organisms. this study describes the effect of a flavan-3-ol enriched grape  seed extract (gse) on the growth of several lactic acid bacteria (lab) and bifidobacteria and the ability of the resistant strains to metabolize these compounds. streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus vaginalis strains showed a remarkable sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, including a gse fraction consisting mainly in (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin (gse-m). on the other hand, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus bulgaricus strains reached maximal growth with the gse fractions, including a rich-oligomeric (gse-o) fraction. within bifidobacteria, bifidobacterium lactis bb12 showed the highest sensitivity to the phenolic extracts assayed, whereas bifidobacterium breve 26m2  and bifidobacterium bifidum hdd541 reached maximum growth in presence of gse-o and gse-m fractions. metabolism of flavan-3-ols by lab and bifidobacteria resistant strains was investigated in vitro. the results revealed that only l. plantarum ifpl935 was able to metabolize the polyphenols studied by means of galloyl-esterase, decarboxylase and benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase activities that  led to the formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol and catechol, respectively. an unknown metabolite that does not exhibit a phenolic-acid-type structure was also  detected, which suggests a new enzyme activity in l. plantarum ifpl935 able to degrade flavan-3-ol monomers.

TI  == selective and differential enumerations of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus  casei and bifidobacterium spp. in yoghurt--a review.
AB  == yoghurt is increasingly being used as a carrier of probiotic bacteria for their potential health benefits. to meet with a recommended level of >/=10(6) viable cells/g of a product, assessment of viability of probiotic bacteria in market preparations is crucial. this requires a working method for selective enumeration of these probiotic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria in yoghurt such as streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lb. acidophilus, lb. casei and bifidobacterium. this chapter presents an overview of  media that could be used for differential and selective enumerations of yoghurt bacteria. de man rogosa sharpe agar containing fructose (mrsf), mrs agar ph 5.2 (mrs 5.2), reinforced clostridial prussian blue agar at ph 5.0 (rcpb 5.0) or reinforced clostridial agar at ph 5.3 (rca 5.3) are suitable for enumeration of lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus when the incubation is carried out at 45 degrees c for 72h. s. thermophilus (st) agar and m17 are recommended for selective enumeration of s. thermophilus. selective enumeration of lb. acidophilus in mixed culture could be made in rogosa agar added with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside (x-glu) or mrs containing maltose (mrsm) and incubation in a 20% co2 atmosphere. lb. casei could be selectively enumerated on specially formulated lb. casei (lc) agar from products  containing yoghurt starter bacteria (s. thermophilus and lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), lb. acidophilus, bifidobacterium spp. and lb. casei. bifidobacterium could be enumerated on mrs agar supplemented with nalidixic acid, paromomycin, neomycin sulphate and lithium chloride (mrs-npnl) under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 72h.

TI  == some low homogenization pressures improve certain probiotic characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and lactobacillus acidophilus la-k.
AB  == lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus, and lactobacillus acidophilus are dairy cultures widely used in the manufacture of cultured dairy products. commonly used homogenization pressures in the dairy industry are 13.80 mpa or less. it is not known whether low homogenization pressures can stimulate bacteria to improve their probiotic characteristics. objectives were to determine the effect of homogenization at 0,  3.45, 6.90, 10.34, and 13.80 mpa on acid tolerance, bile tolerance, protease activity, and growth of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lb-12, s. salivarius ssp.  thermophilus st-m5, and l. acidophilus la-k. the cultures were individually inoculated in cool autoclaved skim milk (4 degrees c) and homogenized for 5 continuous passes. growth and bile tolerance of samples were determined hourly for 10h of incubation. acid tolerance was determined every 20 min for 120 min of  incubation. protease activity was determined at 0, 12, and 24h of incubation. all homogenization pressures studied improved acid tolerance of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus lb-12 but had no beneficial effect on protease activity and had negative effects on growth and bile tolerance. a pressure of 6.90 mpa improved acid tolerance, bile tolerance, and protease activity of s. salivarius ssp. thermophilus st-m5, but none of the homogenization pressures studied had an effect on its growth. homogenization pressures of 13.80 and 6.90 mpa improved acid tolerance and bile tolerance, respectively, of l. acidophilus la-k but had no effect on protease activity and its growth. some low homogenization pressures  positively influenced some characteristics of yogurt culture bacteria and l. acidophilus la-k. culture pretreatment with some low homogenization pressures can be recommended for improvement of certain probiotic characteristics.

TI  == probiotic fermented milk containing dietary fiber has additive effects in ibs with constipation compared to plain probiotic fermented milk.
AB  == background/aims: although controversial, probiotics and dietary fiber are commonly used for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). we evaluated the  effects of multistrain probiotics on the symptoms of ibs to determine whether the addition of dietary fi ber had an additive effect on constipation-predominant ibs. methods: a total of 142 participants who met the rome iii criteria were recruited and randomized into a control group or a test group. participants in the control group received multistrain probiotic fermented milk with streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium infantis; the participants in the test group received the same probiotic fermented milk mixed with dietary fi ber such as sea tangle extracts, radish extracts and glasswort extracts. the patients were treated for four weeks. results: most of the symptoms of ibs, with the exception of fl atulence, stool consistency, and frequency of defecation, signifi cantly improved in both groups. in the analysis of ibs subtypes, especially constipation-predominant ibs, the frequency and duration of defecation and straining at stool were improved more in the test group than in the control group. conclusions: dietary fiber had additive benefits for the symptoms of constipation, especially in constipation-predominant ibs.

TI  == impact of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and, lactobacillus acidophilus la-5-containing yoghurt, on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults.
AB  == this randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel dose-response study investigated the impact of 4-week commercial yoghurt consumption supplemented with bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bb-12) and lactobacillus acidophilus (la-5) on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults. fifty-eight volunteers were randomly assigned to three different groups: 1. placebo (no probiotic, no starter and no green tea extract); 2. yoptimal (10(9)cfu/100g of bb-12 and la-5 and 40mg  of green tea extract) and 3. yoptimal-10 (10(10)cfu/100g of bb-12, 10(9)cfu/100g  of la-5 and 40mg of green tea extract). these yoghurt products also contained lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (10(7)cfu/100g) and streptococcus thermophilus (10(10)cfu/100g). the quantitative pcr (qpcr) results showed that there were significant increases (p=0.02) in bifidobacteria counts with the yoptimal treatment as compared to baseline. the fecal numbers of b. animalis subsp. lactis and la-5 significantly increased in the two probiotic treatments compared to the placebo treatment. viable counts of fecal lactobacilli were significantly higher (p=0.05) and those of enterococci were significantly lower (p=0.04) after the intervention when compared to placebo. no significant difference was observed between treatments in volunteers' weight, waist girth, blood pressure, fasting plasma triglyceride and hdl-c concentrations, as well as  cholesterol/hdl-cholesterol ratio. however, a significant increase in plasma cholesterol levels was observed in the placebo group (p=0.0018) but the levels remained stable in the two probiotic yoghurt groups. these results show that probiotic strains supplemented in the form of yoghurt remain active during gut transit and are associated with an increase in beneficial bacteria and a reduction in potentially pathogenic bacteria. this trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as nct00730626.

TI  == beneficial effects of a synbiotic supplement on self-perceived gastrointestinal well-being and immunoinflammatory status of healthy adults.
AB  == the use of synbiotics as health promoters is still poorly defined, and human intervention studies are scarce. this study was designed to evaluate the effects  of a commercialized synbiotic product containing lactobacillus acidophilus la5, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and fructooligosaccharides on the self-reported gastrointestinal well-being and the immunoinflammatory status of healthy human subjects. in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 20 women and 16 men (25-45 years old) received either three tablets per day of the synbiotic product (2.4 x 10(9) colony-forming units/day) or placebo during 6 weeks. gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habits were evaluated through a self-administered questionnaire. in those subjects suffering from any kind of digestive disturbance (mild dyspepsia,  flatulence, postprandial bloating, constipation, etc.), improvements in symptoms  after product consumption were also evaluated. blood lymphocyte subsets, phagocytic activity, serum c-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin, and adhesion molecules concentrations were analyzed prior and after treatment. a significant improvement in overall self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habit was found in the synbiotic group. a marginal effect of treatment (analysis of variance p = .050) was observed with l-selectin, which showed a significant decrease in the synbiotic group (p = .019). in addition, basal l-selectin levels  correlated with final intercellular adhesion molecule (icam)-1 levels (r = 0.468; p = .050), and basal icam-1 levels tended to correlate negatively with final l-selectin concentration (r = -0.457; p = .056). none of these correlations was found in the placebo group. the rest of the immunological parameters studied were not modified by the intervention. in conclusion, consumption of the synbiotic product improves self-perceived bowel habits and might facilitate a better profile of adhesion molecules in healthy adults.

TI  == characterization and transfer of antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria from fermented food products.
AB  == the study provides phenotypic and molecular analyses of the antibiotic resistance in lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented foods in xi'an, china. lab strains (n = 84) belonging to 16 species of lactobacillus (n = 73), and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 11) were isolated and identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, and cefsulodin, and intrinsically resistant to nalidixic acid, kanamycin, and vancomycin (except l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and s. thermophilus, which were susceptible to vancomycin). some strains had acquired resistance for penicillin (n = 2), erythromycin (n = 9), clindamycin (n = 5), and tetracycline (n = 14), while resistance to gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol was species dependent. minimum inhibitory concentrations presented in this study will help to review microbiological breakpoints for some of the species of lactobacillus. the erm(b) gene was detected from two strains of each of l. fermentum and l. vaginalis, and one strain of each of l. plantarum, l. salivarius, l. acidophilus, l. animalis, and s. thermophilus. the tet genes were  identified from 12 strains of lactobacilli from traditional foods. this is the first time, the authors identified tet(s) gene from l. brevis and l. kefiri. the  erm(b) gene from l. fermentum nwl24 and l. salivarius nwl33, and tet(m) gene from l. plantarum nwl22 and l. brevis nwl59 were successfully transferred to enterococcus faecalis 181 by filter mating. it was concluded that acquired antibiotic resistance is well dispersed in fermented food products in xi'an, china and its transferability to other genera should be monitored closely.

TI  == effects of yogurt starter cultures on the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == recognized to confer health benefits to consumers, probiotics such as lactobacillus acidophilus are commonly incorporated into fermented dairy products worldwide; among which yogurt is a popular delivery vehicle. to materialize most  of the putative health benefits associated with probiotics, an adequate amount of viable cells must be delivered at the time of consumption. however, the loss in their viabilities during refrigerated storage has been demonstrated previously. this study focused on the effects of yogurt starter cultures on the survival of five strains of l. acidophilus, with emphases on low ph and acid production. differential survival behavior between l. acidophilus strains was further analyzed. to this end, viable cell counts of l. acidophilus were determined weekly during 4 degrees c storage in various types of yogurts made with streptococcus thermophilus alone, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus alone, both species of the starter cultures, or glucono-delta-lactone (gdl). all yogurt types, except for pasteurized yogurts, were co-fermented with l. acidophilus. yogurt filtrate was analyzed for the presence of any inhibitory substance and for the amount of hydrogen peroxide. multiplication of l. acidophilus was not affected by the starter cultures as all strains reached high level on day 0 of the storage period. throughout the 28-day storage period, cell counts of l. acidophilus pim703 and sbt2062 remained steady (~6 x 10(7)cfu/g) in yogurts made  with both starter cultures, whereas those of atcc 700396 and ncfm were reduced by a maximum of 3 and 4.6 logs, respectively. when starter cultures were replaced by gdl, all strains survived well, suggesting that a low ph was not a critical factor dictating their survival. in addition, the filtrate collected from yogurts made with starter cultures appeared to have higher inhibitory activities against  l. acidophilus than that made with gdl. the presence of viable starter cultures was necessary to adversely affect the survival of some strains, as pasteurized yogurts had no effect on their survival. in particular, the inhibitory effect exerted by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus on l. acidophilus ncfm was highly pronounced than by s. thermophilus, nevertheless, the same effect was not observed on sbt2062. the inhibition against stationary-phase ncfm cells might be  caused by the elevated level of hydrogen peroxide produced by l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus. delineating factors driving the differences in survival trait among probiotic strains will lead to a more efficacious delivery of health benefits in  fermented dairy products through targeted technological interventions.

TI  == lactic acid fermentation of germinated barley fiber and proliferative function of colonic epithelial cells in loperamide-induced rats.
AB  == to develop a functional food from the dietary fiber fraction of germinated barley (hordeum vulgare l.) (gbf), lactic acid fermentation was attempted using lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium bifidus. the quality characteristics of the lactic acid-fermented product and its effect on gastrointestinal function in an animal model were examined. the anaerobic fermentation of 1% and 2% gbf yielded lactic acid bacteria at 8.9 +/- 1.0 x 10(8) and 1.6 +/- 0.2 x 10(9) colony-forming units/ml, and it was considered acceptable for consumption by sensory assessment. to determine the effect on gastrointestinal function, sprague-dawley rats were fed with three types of diets: a normal chow diet and chow diets supplemented with 10% lactic acid bacteria or a yogurt fermented with 2% gbf (gbfy). the rats fed gbfy for 6 weeks gained less body weight, excreted more fecal mass, and had improved gastrointestinal transit as examined with barium sulfate. the effect of gbfy on colonic epithelial proliferation was investigated through loperamide (lpm)-induced constipation in rats. the rats fed with gbfy for 6 weeks were intraperitoneally administered lpm twice daily for 7 days. gbfy supplementation decreased fecal excretion and moisture content in feces and depleted goblet cells as observed by hematoxylin and eosin stain. however, the rats supplemented with gbfy prior to the lpm administration had enhanced bowel movement, mucin secretion, and production of short-chain fatty acids compared with values for the lpm-alone group. immunohistochemistry revealed that the gbfy supplement increased the numbers of nuclei stained positively for ki-67 and extended from the base to  the middle zone of crypts. these results indicate that gbfy alleviates constipation via the proliferation of the colonic crypts in lpm-administered rats.

TI  == efficacy of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == objective: we assessed the effectiveness of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis (bv) prevention. study design: one hundred twenty healthy chinese women with a history of recurrent bv were assigned randomly to daily vaginal prophylaxis with 1 capsule (probaclac vaginal; nicar laboratories,  inc, blainville, quebec, canada) that contained 8 billion colony-forming units of lactobacillus rhamnosus, l acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 58 women) or 1 placebo capsule (n = 62 women) for 7 days on, 7 days off, and 7 days  on. results: probiotic prophylaxis resulted in lower recurrence rates for bv (15.8% [9/57 women] vs 45.0% [27/60 women]; p < .001) and gardnerella vaginalis incidence through 2 months (3.5% [2/57 women] vs 18.3% [11/60 women]; p = .02). between the 2- and 11-month follow-up period, women who received probiotics reported a lower incidence of bv and g vaginalis. aside from vaginal discharge and malodor, no adverse events were reported in either study group. conclusion: short-term probiotic prophylaxis is well tolerated and reduces bv recurrence and  g vaginalis risk through 11 months after treatment.

TI  == genetic and proteomic analysis of factors affecting serum cholesterol reduction by lactobacillus acidophilus a4.
AB  == this article identifies novel factors involved in cholesterol reduction by probiotic bacteria, which were identified using genetic and proteomic approaches. approximately 600 lactobacillus acidophilus a4 mutants were created by random mutagenesis. the cholesterol-reducing ability of each mutant was determined and verified using two different methods: the o-phthalaldehyde assay and gas chromatographic analysis (gc). among screened mutants, strain ba9 showed a dramatically diminished ability to reduce cholesterol, as demonstrated by a 7.7%  reduction rate, while the parent strain had a more than 50% reduction rate. the transposon insertion site was mapped using inverse pcr (i-pcr), and it was determined using bioinformatic methods that the deleted region contained the streptococcus thermophilus catabolite control protein a gene (ccpa). in addition, we have shown using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-de) that several proteins, including a transcription regulator, fmn-binding protein, major facilitator superfamily permease, glycogen phosphorylase, the yknv protein, and fructose/tagatose bisphosphate aldolase, were strongly regulated by the ccpa gene. in addition, in vivo experiments investigating ccpa function were conducted with rats. rats fed wild-type l. acidophilus a4 showed a greater than 20% reduction in total serum cholesterol, but rats fed ba9 mutant l. acidophilus showed only an approximately 10% reduction in cholesterol. these results provide  important insights into the mechanism by which these lactic acid bacteria reduce  cholesterol.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == functional fermented whey-based beverage using lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == whey protein concentrate (wpc) is employed as functional food ingredient because  of its nutritional value and emulsifying properties. however, the major whey protein beta-lactoglobulin (blg) is the main cause of milk allergy. the aim of this study was to formulate a fermented whey beverage using selected lactic acid  bacteria and wpc35 (wpc containing 35% of proteins) to obtain a fermented product with low lactose and blg contents and high essential amino acid concentration. cell viability, lactose consumption, lactic acid production, proteolytic activity, amino acid release and blg degradation by the selected strains lactobacillus acidophilus crl 636, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 656 and streptococcus thermophilus crl 804, as single or mixed (slab) cultures were evaluated in wpc35 (10%, w/v) incubated at 37 degrees c for 24h. then, the fermented wpc35 was mixed with peach juice and calcium lactate (2%, w/v) and stored at 10 degrees c for 28 days. during fermentation, single cultures grew 1.7-3.1 log cfu/ml and produced 25.1-95.0 mmol/l of lactic acid as consequence of lactose consumption (14.0-41.8 mmol/l) after 12h fermentation. l.  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 656 was the most proteolytic strain (626 microg/ml leu) and released the branched-chain essential amino acids leu (16 microg/ml), ile (27 microg/ml) and val (43 microg/ml). all strains were able to degrade blg in a range of 41-85% after 12h incubation. the starter culture slab grew 3.0 log cfu/ml, showed marked ph reduction, produced 122.0 mmol/l of lactic  acid, displayed high proteolytic activity (484 microg/ml leu) releasing leu (13 microg/ml), ile (18 microg/ml) and val (35 microg/ml), and hydrolyzed 92% of blg. the addition of calcium lactate to wpc35 maintained the drink ph stable during shelf life; no contamination was detected during this period. after 28 days, a decrease in cell viability of all strains was observed being more pronounced for  l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 656 and l. acidophilus crl 636 (2.3 and 1.9  log cfu/ml, respectively). the results showed that wpc fermentation by rationally selected lactic acid bacteria might be used for developing functional beverages with improved characteristics such as reduced blg content and increased branched-chain essential amino acids.

TI  == multistep mechanism of probiotic bacterium, the effect on innate immune system.
AB  == the etiology and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease are still not fully understood. however, evidence from both animal models and clinical observations suggests luminal bacteria as the most probable inducer of this disease. the intestinal bacterial microbiota may be modified by dietary addition of viable probiotic bacteria, thereby constituting an alternative approach to disease prevention and treatment. the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of two probiotic regiments; lactobacillus gg and a mixture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium lactis (yo-mix y 109 fro 1000) in both normal and trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid colitis-induced rats. colon morphology and damage were evaluated histologically;  colonic tissues were used for mrna analysis, using real-time pcr. administration  of both probiotics reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and il-6 and increased the expression of mucin 2 in compared with colitis group and reduced the inflammatory response. these results  provide additional support for the positive effect of probiotics in the gut and may shed light on the mechanism by which probiotic bacteria exert their action in an animal model.

TI  == effect of probiotic supplementation on immunoglobulins, isoagglutinins and antibody response in children of low socio-economic status.
AB  == background: antigen exposure is one of the major exogenous factors modulating human immunocompetence acquisition. decline in family size and improvements in public health and hygiene in developed countries, may deprive the immune system of appropriate antigen input by diminishing infectious stimuli. probiotics are a  large group of microorganisms defined by their beneficial effects on human health and with stimulating effects on different functions of the immune system. aim of  the study: we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine if  probiotics maintain their immune-stimulating effects in a population of 162 children with a high index of natural exposure to microorganisms. children were to ingest for at least 4 months one of two products, low-fat milk fermented by streptococcus thermophilus (control product) or low-fat milk fermented by s. thermophilus and lactobacillus casei, with lactobacillus acidophilus, oligofructose and inulin added after the fermentation process (test product). according to their age, children were vaccinated with dtp-hib vaccine or a 23-valent anti-pneumococcal vaccine. results: final analysis of results was done  in 70 children in each group, showing that the rate of immunoglobulin and isoagglutinin acquisition was similar in both groups. there was no difference between groups in antibody levels neither before nor after vaccination. days of fever and number of episodes of infection were not statistically different in either group. conclusions: supplementation of standard fermented milk with additional probiotics was not of benefit. the high natural rate of early microbial exposure in infants and children from a population of low socio-economic status living in a "less hygienic environment" may account for the absence of an additional immune-stimulating effect by supplementary probiotics.

TI  == enhancement of survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid bacteria by yeasts in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions.
AB  == the effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (lab) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees c) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live lab. five yeasts tested (saccharomyces bayanus, williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, yarrowia lipolytica, candida kefyr and kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. seven yeasts examined (candida krusei, geotrichum candidum, pichia subpelliculosa, kloeckera apiculata, pichia membranifaciens, schizosaccharomyces  pombe and y. lipolytica) improved the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. w. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus (probiotic) and  lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus in fermented milk. these results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on lab and that the specific effects of yeasts on lab stability vary with yeasts as well as with lab. however, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with lab remains to be found.

TI  == prevention of tnbs-induced colitis by different lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains is associated with an expansion of gammadeltat and regulatory t cells of  intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes.
AB  == background: probiotics may protect against inflammatory bowel disease through regulation of lamina propria lymphocytes (lpls) function. data are lacking on possible involvement of intraepithelial lymphocytes (iels). the aim of this study was to investigate whether different probiotic mixtures prevented gut inflammatory disease and the role of both iels and lpls. methods: balb/c mice received 2 probiotic mixtures orally for 3 weeks, as mix1 (lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium longum), or mix2 (lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis). colitis  was induced by intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs). probiotics in stools were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). colon subpopulations of iels and lpls were assayed by flow cytometry. serum cytokines were measured by cytometric bead array (cba). results: all probiotics colonized the intestine. the 2 mixtures prevented the tnbs-induced intestinal damage, and mix1 was the most effective. the mix1 protection was associated with a reduction in cd4(+) cells of iels and lpls, an increase in gammadeltat cells of iels, and a decrease in gammadeltat cells of lpls. an expansion of t regulatory (treg) cells of iels was induced by mix1 and mix2. both probiotic mixtures inhibited tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein (mcp)-1 production and upregulated interleukin (il)-10. in addition, mix1 prevented the tnbs-induced increase of il-12 and interferon (ifn)-gamma. conclusions: the 2 probiotic mixtures were able to prevent the tnbs-induced colitis; the l. acidophilus and b. longum mixture was the most effective. other than an involvement of lpls, our results report a novel importance of the iels population in probiotic protection.

TI  == effect of exopolysaccharides on the hydrolysis of beta-lactoglobulin by lactobacillus acidophilus crl 636 in an in vitro gastric/pancreatic system.
AB  == an analysis of the peptides generated by hydrolysis of blg by nonproliferating cells of the strain lactobacillus acidophilus crl 636 was carried out. the effect of polysaccharides (pectin, and two eps synthesized by two streptococcus thermophilus strains, eps1190 and eps804) on blg digestibility using an in vitro  gastric/pancreatic system was analyzed. polysaccharides are commonly used in the  dairy industry to improve food texture; these hydrocolloids may interact with proteins, affecting their digestibility. nonproliferating cells of lb. acidophilus crl 636 were able to hydrolyze 52% of blg. twenty-six resulting peptides with molecular masses in the range 544-4119 da were identified by lc-ms/ms. these peptides resulted mostly from the hydrolysis of the more accessible n-terminal part of blg. degradation of blg by pepsin was poor (8%). when blg was previously hydrolyzed by lb. acidophilus crl 636, peptic hydrolysis  was of 54.8%, while when pectin and eps1190 were added, hydrolysis was higher (58.2 and 57.2%, respectively). peptides crossing 8 kda dialysis membranes after  trypsin/chymotrypsin hydrolysis were analyzed by hpsec. the produced peptides were smaller when blg was hydrolyzed previously by the lb. acidophilus strain. moreover, in the presence of pectin, the amount of the larger peptide (3.5 kda) observed in the size exclusion chromatograms was considerably decreased. our studies showed that prehydrolysis of blg by lb. acidophilus crl 636 had a positive influence on blg digestibility and that polysaccharides may change the peptide profile yielded by trypsin/chymotrypsin hydrolysis, releasing smaller size peptides, which are known to be less immune-reactive. moreover, lb. acidophilus crl 636 was able to hydrolyze the main epitopes (41-60, 102-124, and  149-162) of blg, reducing its allergenic content.

TI  == lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 increases lactacin b production when it senses live target bacteria.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 is a probiotic strain used in dairy products. production of bacteriocin by l. acidophilus la-5 was achieved when it was grown in co-cultures with the yogurt starter species streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. however, bacteriocin induction was not observed when heat-killed cells were used as inducers. this study demonstrates that l. acidophilus la-5 produces lactacin b and that the bacteriocin expression is controlled by an auto-induction mechanism involving the secreted peptide ip_1800. the transcript level of the lactacin b gene cluster expression was investigated in co-cultures between l. acidophilus la-5 and s. thermophilus sty-31 and a remarkable increase of the bacteriocin structural gene  (lbab) transcription was observed. however, lbab was transcribed constitutively in uninduced l. acidophilus la-5 cells, but the levels of the secreted bacteriocin were not enough to be detected by the agar diffusion assay. a new method for bacteriocin detection was formulated based on the monitoring on real time of lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei growth in presence of the supernatant and the cell wall extracts of pure and induced l. acidophilus la-5. these results showed that part of lactacin b secreted remains adhered to cell envelope.

AB  == the simultaneous effects of different binary co-cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus rhamnosus and bifidobacterium lactis with streptococcus thermophilus and of different prebiotics on the production of fermented milk were investigated in this paper. in particular, we determined and compared the kinetics of acidification of milk either as such or supplemented with 4% (w/w) maltodextrin, oligofructose and polydextrose, as well as the probiotic survival, chemical composition (ph, lactose, lactic acid and protein contents), fatty acids profile and conjugate linoleic acid (cla) content of fermented milk after storage at 4 degrees c for 24 h. fermented milk quality was strongly influenced both by the co-culture composition and the selected prebiotic. depending on the co-culture, prebiotic addition to milk influenced to different extent kinetic acidification parameters. all probiotic counts were stimulated by oligofructose and polydextrose, and among these b. lactis always exhibited the highest counts in all supplemented milk samples. polydextrose addition led to the highest post-acidification. although the contents of the main fatty acids were only barely influenced, the highest amounts of conjugated linoleic acid (38% higher than in the control) were found in milk fermented by s. thermophilus-l. acidophilus co-culture and supplemented with maltodextrin.

AB  == background: this study was performed to evaluate whether the addition of probiotics to proton pump inhibitor (ppi)-based triple therapy increases the likelihood of successful helicobacter pylori eradication. materials and methods:  three hundred and forty-seven h. pylori-infected patients were randomized into a  triple-plus-yogurt group (yogurt group, n = 168) or a triple-only group (control  group, n = 179). triple therapy consisted of ppi b.i.d., clarithromycin 500 mg b.i.d., and amoxicillin 1 g b.i.d. for 7 days. yogurt group received triple therapy for 1 week and one bottle of will yogurt per day for at 3 weeks, starting on the first day of triple therapy. will yogurt (a korean brand) contains lactobacillus acidophilus hy2177, lactobacillus casei hy2743, bifidobacterium longum hy8001, and streptococcus thermophilus b-1. (13)c-urea breath test was performed at least 4 weeks after completion of triple therapy. eradication rates, compliances, and adverse events were compared. results: by intention-to treat analysis the h. pylori eradication rates in the yogurt group 79.2% (133 of 168) was similar to that in the control group 72.1% (129 of 179) (p = .124). however,  by per-protocol (pp) analysis, the eradication rate in the yogurt group, 87.5% (133 of 152) was higher than that in the control group, 78.7% (129 of 164) (p = .037). common adverse events were metallic taste (11.8%) and diarrhea (8.6%). the frequency of adverse effects in the yogurt group 41.1% (69/168) were higher than  in the control group, 26.3% (47 of 179) (p = .003). however, most adverse events  were mild to moderate in intensity, and the severities of adverse effects were similar in both groups (p = .401). conclusions: the addition of will yogurt to triple therapy did not reduce the side-effects of triple therapy. but it increased the h. pylori eradication rate by pp analysis, encouraging more research in this field.

AB  == purpose: the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is thought to be a multifactorial process. one of the leading hypotheses is that an imbalance in normal gut flora induces an excessive immune response and contributes to inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. administration of probiotic bacteria  reduces symptoms in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, probably via both manipulation of the microflora and stimulation of the intestinal immune  system. in the current study the therapeutic potential of two different probiotics-lactobacillus gg and a mixture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium longum (yo-mix y 109 fro 1000)--in a rat model of colitis were evaluated. methods: male wistar rats were administered probiotics for three days simultaneously with colitis induction. colonic damage was evaluated histologically and biochemically and colonic tissues, as well as fecal samples, were used for bacterial studies using 16s rrna gene primers. results: probiotics administration reduced the relative amounts of  the pathogenic bacteria aeromonas and escherichia coli in the colonic tissue. however, whereas both probiotics affected colon morphology, only lactobacillus gg administration reduced myeloperoxidase activity. conclusions: we report the therapeutic rather than preventive potential of two different probiotics in an animal model of colitis.

TI  == antibacterial action of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic escherichia coli.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory activity of selenium-enriched probiotics against pathogenic escherichia coli (e. coli) in vitro and in vivo. escherichia coli was co-cultured in vitro with each probiotic  strain individually, and a mixture of the four strains and its population was counted at various time points. we also collected a cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) of each probiotic strain and the four-strain mix to examine their antibacterial activity, using the cylinder plate method. results demonstrated that co-culture with probiotics significantly reduced the number of e. coli. the  different sizes of the inhibition zones made by each cfcs proved that e. coli was inhibited by the metabolites of the probiotics. in vivo, kunming mice were allocated to different groups supplemented with selenium-enriched and other probiotics. after 28 days, the mice were inoculated with pathogenic e. coli so that we could compare mortality rates and inspect other indexes of each treatment. the mortality of the group with selenium-enriched probiotics was the lowest. in addition, the organic antioxidant status improved, immunity was fortified, and the internal environment of the intestinal tract was enhanced with selenium-enriched probiotic supplementation. in conclusion, selenium-enriched probiotics can strongly antagonize pathogenic e. coli in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == a double blind randomized controlled trial of a probiotic combination in 100 patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a probiotic  combination on symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). methods: we investigated the efficiency of a probiotic dietary supplement, containing four strains of lactic acid bacteria, on symptoms of ibs. one hundred and sixteen patients with ibs fulfilling the rome ii criteria were randomized in a parallel group, double-blind study to receive a placebo or a probiotic combination (1 x 10(10) cfu once daily) for four weeks. the symptoms that were monitored weekly included discomfort, abdominal pain, and stool frequency and quality. quality of  life was assessed before and at the end of the treatment using the sf36 and fdd-quality-of-life questionnaires. results: one hundred subjects completed the study (48 probiotic combination, 52 placebo). the probiotic combination was not superior to the placebo in relieving symptoms of ibs (42.6 versus 42.3% improvement). however, the decrease of abdominal pain between the first and the fourth week of treatment was significantly higher in probiotic treated patients (-41.9 versus -24.2%, p=0.048). interesting findings from the ibs sub-groups were also observed such as a lower pain score at end point in patients with alternating bowel habits (p=0.023) and an increase of stool frequency in the constipated sub-group from the first week of probiotic treatment (p=0.043). conclusions: the probiotic combination was not significantly superior to the placebo in relieving symptoms of ibs. despite the apparent high placebo response, interesting findings from ibs sub-groups were observed in the field of abdominal  pain and stool frequency.

TI  == whey fermentation by thermophilic lactic acid bacteria: evolution of carbohydrates and protein content.
AB  == whey, a by-product of the cheese industry usually disposed as waste, is a source  of biological and functional valuable proteins. the aim of this work was to evaluate the potentiality of three lactic acid bacteria strains to design a starter culture for developing functional whey-based drinks. fermentations were performed at 37 and 42 degrees c for 24h in reconstituted whey powder (rw). carbohydrates, organic acids and amino acids concentrations during fermentation were evaluated by rp-hplc. proteolytic activity was measured by the o-phthaldialdehyde test and hydrolysis of whey proteins was analyzed by tricine sds-page. the studied strains grew well (2-3log cfu/ml) independently of the temperature used. streptococcus thermophilus crl 804 consumed 12% of the initial  lactose concentration and produced the highest amount of lactic acid (45 mmol/l)  at 24h. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus crl 454 was the most proteolytic (91 microg leu/ml) strain and released the branched chain amino acids leu and val. in contrast, lactobacillus acidophilus crl 636 and s. thermophilus crl 804 consumed most of the amino acids present in whey. the studied strains were able to degrade the major whey proteins, alpha-lactalbumin being degraded in a greater extent (2.2-3.4-fold) than beta-lactoglobulin. two starter cultures were evaluated for their metabolic and proteolytic activities in rw. both cultures acidified and reduced the lactose content in whey in a greater extent than the strains alone. the amino acid release was higher (86 microg/ml) for the  starter slb (strains crl 804+crl 454) than for sla (strains crl 804+crl 636, 37 microg/ml). regarding alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin degradation, no differences were observed as compared to the values obtained with the single cultures. the starter culture slb showed high potential to be used for developing fermented whey-based beverages.

TI  == proteolytic profiles and angiotensin-i converting enzyme and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of selected lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == this study was conducted to examine the growth, proteolytic profiles as well as angiotensin-i converting enzyme (ace) and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) inhibitory potentials of selected strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab). two strains each of yogurt bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus-1275 and 285, and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus-1092 and 1368), and probiotics (l. acidophilus-4461 and 33200, and l. casei-2607 and 15286, and 1 strain of bifidobacterium longum 5022), were cultivated in reconstituted skim milk (rsm) at 37 degrees c and their proteolytic profiles and ace as well as alpha-glu inhibitory activities were determined. among all the strains of lactic acid bacteria studied, yogurt bacteria grew very well, with the exception of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368 which showed a slower growth during the initial  3 h of incubation. the growth pattern corresponded well with the decrease in ph for the organisms. all the organisms showed an increase in proteolysis with time. the variations in proteolytic capabilities translated into corresponding variations in ace inhibitory potential of these organisms. bifidobacterium longum 5022 showed the highest ace inhibitory potential followed by l. delbrueckii ssp.  bulgaricus 1368, l. casei 15286, s. thermophilus 1275, and l. acidophilus 4461. organisms with high intracellular enzymatic activities grew well. also, aminopeptidases of strains of l. acidophilus 4461 and s. thermophilus 1275 that could better utilize proline containing substrates showed enhanced ace inhibitory potential. lactic acid bacteria possessed the ability to inhibit alpha-glu activity, which endowed them an antidiabetic property as well.

TI  == probiotic crescenza cheese containing lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus acidophilus manufactured with high-pressure homogenized milk.
AB  == high-pressure homogenization (hph) is one of the most promising alternatives to traditional thermal treatment of food preservation and diversification. its effectiveness on the deactivation of pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms in model systems and real food is well documented. to evaluate the potential of milk treated by hph for the production of crescenza cheese with commercial probiotic lactobacilli added, 4 types of cheeses were made: hph (from hph-treated milk), p  (from pasteurized milk), hph-p (hph-treated milk plus probiotics), and p-p (pasteurized milk plus probiotics) cheeses. a strain of streptococcus thermophilus was used as starter culture for cheese production. compositional, microbiological, physicochemical, and organoleptic analyses were carried out at 1, 5, 8, and 12 d of refrigerated storage (4 degrees c). according to results obtained, no significant differences among the 4 cheese types were observed for gross composition (protein, fat, moisture) and ph. differently, the hph treatment of milk increased the cheese yield about 1% and positively affected the viability during the refrigerated storage of the probiotic bacteria. in fact, after 12 d of storage, the lactobacillus paracasei a13 cell loads were 8 log cfu/ g, whereas lactobacillus acidophilus h5 exhibited, in p-p cheese, a cell load decrease of about 1 log cfu/g with respect to the hph-p cheese. the hyperbaric treatment had  a significant positive effect on free fatty acids release and cheese proteolysis. also, probiotic cultures affected proteolytic and lipolytic cheese patterns. no significant differences were found for the sensory descriptors salty and creamy among hph and p cheeses as well as for acid, piquant, sweet, milky, salty, creamy, and overall acceptance among hph, hph-p, and p-p crescenza cheeses.

TI  == antiallergic effect of milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria in a murine animal model.
AB  == the objective of this study was to assess the antiallergic effect of fermented milk prepared, respectively, with streptococcus thermophilus mc, lactobacillus acidophilus b, lactobacillus bulgaricus lb, l. bulgaricus 448, and bifidobacterium longum b6. female balb/c mice fed fermented milk were immunized intraperitoneally with ovalbumin (ova)/complete freund's adjuvant (cfa) to evaluate the immune response by observing the secretion of cytokines il-2, il-4,  and ifn-gamma and serum antibody ige. the results showed that supplementation with lactic acid bacteria fermented milk did not significantly change the il-2 spontaneous and ova-stimulated secretions of splenocytes. however, both spontaneous and ova-stimulated secretions of splenocytes from mice fed lactic acid bacteria fermented milk showed significantly (p < 0.05) lower levels of il-4 (th2 cytokine) than those from ova/cfa-immunized mice fed non-fermented milk (ova/cfa-milk group). the spontaneous secretion of ifn-gamma (th1 cytokine) by splenocytes from mice fed l. bulgaricus 448 or l. bulgaricus lb fermented milk significantly increased as compared to that from the ova/cfa-milk group. the results showed that the ratios of ifn-gamma to il-4 of both spontaneous and ova-stimulated secretions in splenocytes from mice fed lactic acid bacteria fermented milk increased significantly as compared to that of pbs- or ova/cfa-milk groups. the serum levels of ova-specific ige in fermented milk fed groups, especially the group fed s. thermophilus mc fermented milk, were significantly lower than those in the ova/cfa-milk group through a 6 week feeding experiment. the results showed that milk fermented with lactic acid bacteria demonstrated in vivo antiallergic effects on ova/cfa-immunized mice via increasing the secretion ratio of ifn-gamma/il-4 (th1/th2) by splenocytes and decreasing the serum level of ova-specific ige.

TI  == rapid restoration of colonic goblet cells induced by a hydrolyzed diet containing probiotics in experimental malnutrition.
AB  == purpose: to investigate the effects of the addition of probiotic bacteria to a hydrolyzed diet on the recovery of goblet cells during renutrition in an animal model of malnutrition. methods: twenty-six male wistar rats (200-250g) were included in the study. six were kept under normal conditions (sham group) while twenty received an aproteic diet for 15 days, and were randomized thereafter to receive a hydrolyzed diet containing (n=6; probiotic group) or not (n=6; hydrolyzed group) probiotics (10(6) cfu/g of streptococcus thermophilus e lactobacillus helveticus); or immediately killed (n=8; aproteic group). histological slides containing cecal and sigmoid biopsies were used to counting the number of goblet cells and the goblet cells/colonocytes ratio. results: malnutrition diminished the population of goblet cells in all sites. goblet cells/colonocytes ratio of the probiotic group was significantly greater than hydrolyzed group at the ceccum (0.39 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.34 +/-0.02; p=0.02). only rats fed with probiotics showed complete restoration of the normal goblet cells/colonocytes ratio at the sigmoid (0.37 +/- 0,02 vs. 0.22 +/- 0,03; p<0,001). conclusion: streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus helveticus added to a renutrition diet enhance the recovery of mucosal atrophy induced by malnutrition and especially induce a rapid restoration of goblet cells population in the malnourished colonic mucosa.

TI  == influence of the dairy environment on gene expression and substrate utilization in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are widely used for the industrial production of fermented dairy products and form a group of related low-gc-content gram-positive bacteria. the major species used in dairy manufacturing are lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and leuconostoc. traditionally most are applied as starter cultures for dairy fermentations or used as probiotic cultures, delivered in dairy vehicles. the appearance of the genomes of lactococcus lactis, bidifobacterium longum, lactobacillus plantarum, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, 2  strains of streptococcus thermophilus, and pending completion of many draft genomic sequences, is now promoting in-depth investigation into the comparative genetic content of lab. moreover, whole-genome transcriptional arrays are quickly revealing critical genes/operons that are coordinately expressed and the impact of environmental factors on expression of multiple gene sets. comparative genomics between multiple genomes is providing insights into genes that are important in metabolic, physiological, and functional roles for different lab in  the environments they inhabit, ranging from the gastrointestinal tract to milk and acidified dairy products.

TI  == production of yoghurt with mild taste by a lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus mutant with altered proteolytic properties.
AB  == in this communication, we describe the isolation of a lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 92063 mutant strain named ph-p11, which differed from the parent strain by low proteolytic activity and altered regulation of expression of lacz in the presence of glucose or lactose. in the presence of lactose, beta-galactosidase activity was approximately twice as high in ph-p11 than in the wild type. ph-p11 exhibited protosymbiosis together with streptococcus thermophilus. yoghurt produced with ph-p11 was characterized by low acidity and little post-acidification during storage. the organoleptic properties (absence of bitterness and other off-flavors, weak sourness, and clear yoghurt taste) were those of a typical "yoghurt mild". this mild flavor was achieved at rather high cell counts of lactobacilli even at the end of shelf-life. high cell counts in conjunction with high beta-galactosidase activity make ph-p11 an interesting strain for application in yoghurt especially designed for consumers with lactose  malabsorption. in contrast to "yoghurt mild", which is predominantly produced with lactobacillus acidophilus together with streptococcus thermophilus, the product obtained by fermentation with ph-p11 and streptococcus thermophilus concurs with international standards for yoghurt. during frequent sub-culturing,  strain ph-p11, which is supposed to differ from the wild type by one or a few so-far-not-characterized mutations, showed sufficient stability for application in industrial production.

TI  == transformation of isoflavone phytoestrogens during the fermentation of soymilk with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == in the present study, soymilk is fermented with lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus bcrc 14085, lactobacillus acidophilus bcrc 14079) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium infantis bcrc 14633, b. longum b6) individually,  and in combination. the change in the content of various isoflavones (aglycones,  glucoside, acetyl- and malonyl-glucosides) and the beta-glucosidase activity in soymilk during fermentation is investigated. it is observed that fermented soymilk contains a lower total isoflavone content (81.94-86.61 microg/ml) than soymilk without fermentation (87.61 microg/ml). regardless of starter organism employed, fermentation causes a major reduction in the contents of glucoside, malonylglucoside and acetylglucoside isoflavones along with a significant increase of aglycone isoflavones content. the level of change in the content of various isoflavones and beta-glucosidase activity after fermentation varies with  the starter organism. among all the fermented soymilks tested, soymilk fermented  with s. thermophilus showed the highest beta-glucosidase activity and the greatest increase in the contents of aglycones. the percentage of daidzein, genistein and glycitein to total isoflavone content in s. thermophilus-fermented  soymilk increases from an initial 14.24%, 6.89% and 2.45%, respectively, to 36.20%, 28.80% and 12.44% after 24h of fermentation. finally, the increase of aglycones and decrease of glucoside isoflavones during fermentation coincides with the increase of beta-glucosidase activity observed in fermented soymilk.

AB  == to further the goal of developing a probiotic dietary adjunct using soymilk, soymilk is fermented with lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus ccrc 14079 or streptococcus thermophilus ccrc 14085) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium infantis ccrc 14633 or bifidobacterium longum b6) individually,  and in conjunction. we investigate several antioxidative activities including the inhibition of ascorbate autoxidation, the scavenging effect of superoxide anion radicals and hydrogen peroxide, and the reducing activity exerted by different varieties of fermented soymilks. in addition, the effect of spray-drying and freeze-drying on changes in antioxidative activity is examined. we find that in fermented soymilk both the inhibition of ascorbate autoxidation, and the reducing activity and scavenging effect of superoxide anion radicals varied with the starters used, but nevertheless are significantly higher than those found in unfermented soymilk. in general, antioxidative activity in soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria simultaneously is significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that fermented with either individually. moreover, antioxidative activity increases as the fermentation period is extended. however, unfermented soymilk shows an h2o2-scavenging effect, while there is no scavenging effect except for the accumulation of h2o2 in fermented soymilk. finally, we find that freeze-drying causes a significantly lesser (p < 0.05) reduction in the antioxidative activity of soymilk than does spray-drying. irrespective of the drying method and the starters used for fermentation. the antioxidative activity  of fermented soymilk reduces after drying yet remains higher than that of dried unfermented soymilk.

TI  == vsl#3 probiotic mixture: a review of its use in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve and b. infantis) and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomised, open-label, multicentre trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == mutagenicity and antimutagenic effect of soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == in this study, soymilk was first fermented with lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum) both individually and simultaneously. mutagenicity and the suppression of fermented soymilk against the mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide (4-nqo), a direct-acting mutagen, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl (dmab), an indirect-acting mutagen, on salmonella typhimurium ta 100, was then investigated. it was found that the fermented soymilk shows no mutagenic activity on sal. typhimurium ta 100. fermentation, in general, significantly (p<0.05) enhanced the antimutagenicity of soymilk. the levels of increased antimutagenicity of fermented soymilk varied with the starter organism and the type of mutagen tested. although unfermented soymilk exerted lower antimutagenic activity against dmab than 4-nqo, the fermented soymilk, generally, showed a higher antimutagenic activity against dmab than 4-nqo. among the various fermented soymilk tested, soymilk fermented with both str. themophilus and b. infantis simultaneously exhibited the highest antimutagenicity of 85.07% and 85.78%, respectively, against 4-nqo and dmab further investigation on this fermented soymilk revealed that both the antimutagenic factors formed during fermentation and the cells of the starter organisms contributed to the increased antimutagenic activity against dmab, while the former led to the increased activity against 4-nqo.

TI  == [study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  == a comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. at physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms.  lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) cfu/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) cfu/1 g in the intestine content. the spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. quantity of e. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) cfu/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) cfu/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) cfu/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: lactobacillus acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--l. plantarum and l. fermentum. all the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists  of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. the degree of  adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. the highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62)  and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. the screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. the strain of lactobacillus plantarum 200d proved to be the most active one. a complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization  of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. the biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == probiotics and commensals reverse tnf-alpha- and ifn-gamma-induced dysfunction in human intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == background & aims: commensal bacteria are crucial for the development of the mucosal immune system. probiotics are commensals with special characteristics and may protect mucosal surfaces against pathogens. pathogens cause significant phenotypic alterations in infected epithelial cells, and probiotics reverse these deleterious responses. we hypothesized that probiotics and/or commensals may also reverse epithelial damage produced by cytokines. methods: human intestinal epithelial cells were exposed basolaterally to interferon (ifn)-gamma (10(3) u/ml) or tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha (10 ng/ml) for up to 48 hours and assessed for ion transport, transepithelial resistance (ter), and epithelial permeability in the presence or absence of probiotics (streptococcus thermophilus [st] and lactobacillus acidophilus [la]), or the commensal, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (bt). results: agonist-stimulated chloride secretion was inhibited by ifn-gamma, an effect prevented by st/la or bt. the ability of st/la  or bt to restore cl(-) secretion was blocked by inhibitors of p38 mapk, erk1, 2,  and pi3k. the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) and the  nkcc1 cotransporter were down-regulated by ifn-gamma, and st/la pretreatment reversed this effect. both tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma significantly reduced ter and  increased epithelial permeability, effects prevented by st/la or bt. a janus kinase (jak) inhibitor synergistically potentiated effects of st/la or bt on ter  and permeability, but p38, erk1, 2, or pi3k inhibition did not. finally, only probiotic-treated epithelial cells exposed to cytokines showed reduced activation of socs3 and stat1,3. conclusions: deleterious effects of tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma on epithelial function are prevented by probiotic, and to a lesser extent, commensal pretreatment. these data extend the spectrum of effects of such bacteria on intestinal epithelial function and may justify their use in inflammatory disorders.

TI  == effects of yeasts and bacteria on the levels of folates in rye sourdoughs.
AB  == fermentation of rye dough is often accompanied with an increase in folate content. in this study, three sourdough yeasts, candida milleri cbs 8195, saccharomyces cerevisiae ts 146, and torulaspora delbrueckii ts 207; a control, baker's yeast s. cerevisiae alko 743; and four lactobacillus spp., l. acidophilus tsb 262, l. brevis tsb 307, l. plantarum tsb 304, and l. sanfranciscensis tsb 299 originally isolated from rye sourdough were examined for their abilities to produce or consume folates. the microorganisms were grown in yeast extract-peptone-d-glucose medium as well as in small-scale fermentations that modelled the sourdough fermentation step used in rye baking. total folate contents were determined using lactobacillus rhamnosus (atcc 7469) as the growth  indicator organism. the microorganisms studied did not excrete folates into the media in significant amounts. yeasts increased the folate contents of sterilised  rye flour-water mixtures from 6.5 microg/100 g to between 15 and 23 microg/100 g  after 19-h fermentation, whereas lactic acid bacteria decreased it to between 2.9 and 4.2 microg/100 g. strains of lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. casei, l. curvatus, l. fermentum, l. helveticus, pediococcus spp., and streptococcus thermophilus that were also tested gave folate contents after fermentation that varied between 2 and 10.4 microg/100 g. although the four lactobacillus spp. from sourdough consumed folates their effect on folate contents in co-cultivations was minimal.  it was concluded that the increase of folate content during fermentation was mainly due to folate synthesis by yeasts. fermentation of non-sterilised flour-water mixtures as such resulted in three-fold increases in the folate contents. two folate producing bacteria were isolated from the non-sterilised flour and identified as enterobacter cowanii and pantoea agglomerans.

TI  == evaluation of a diet containing probiotics and zinc for the treatment of mild diarrheal illness in children younger than one year of age.
AB  == objectives: supplementation of probiotics and supplementation of zinc during acute gastroenteritis in children have been shown to exert positive effects on diarrhea duration and severity. our aim was to evaluate a new diet enriched with  zinc and probiotic bacteria in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in young children. methods: in a double blind prospective study, 65 children aged 6-12 months were randomized to receive 6 x 10(9) colony forming units of streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus (2 x 10(9) of each strain), 10 mg of zinc/day, and 0.3 grams of fructo-oligosaccharides in the  supplemented group (n = 33) or placebo (n = 32), given in a soy protein based rice cereal. for each child, age, sex, weight, degree of dehydration, the presence of fever or vomiting, stool frequency and consistency were recorded daily until diarrhea resolution. results: diarrhea resolution occurred after 1.43 +/- 0.71 days in the supplemented group vs. 1.96 +/- 1.24 in the control group (p = 0.017). in the subset of children who presented with vomiting, time to vomiting resolution was 0.27 +/- 0.59 vs. 0.81 +/- 0.91 days in the supplemented and control groups, respectively (p = 0.06). on day 3, there was only 1 child with watery stools in the supplemented group versus 10 children in the control group (p = 0.02). conclusions: in our series, the feeding of a cereal containing streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus and zinc, reduced the severity and duration of acute gastroenteritis in young children. however, whether this combination is better than either the addition of probiotics or zinc alone is yet to be determined.

TI  == use of a probiotic to decrease enteric hyperoxaluria.
AB  == background: patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a 10- to 100-fold increased risk of nephrolithiasis, with enteric hyperoxaluria being the major risk factor for these and other patients with fat malabsorptive states. endogenous components of the intestinal microflora can potentially limit dietary  oxalate absorption. methods: ten patients were studied with chronic fat malabsorption, calcium oxalate stones, and hyperoxaluria thought to be caused by  jejunoileal bypass (1) and roux-en-y gastric bypass surgery for obesity (4), dumping syndrome secondary to gastrectomy (2), celiac sprue (1), chronic pancreatitis (1), and ulcerative colitis in remission (1). for 3 months, patients received increasing doses of a lactic acid bacteria mixture (oxadrop), vsl pharmaceuticals), followed by a washout month. twenty-four-hour urine collections were performed at baseline and after each month. results: mean urinary oxalate excretion fell by 19% after 1 month (1 dose per day, p < 0.05), and oxalate excretion remained reduced by 24% during the second month (2 doses per day, p < 0.05). during the third month on 3 doses per day oxalate excretion increased slightly, so that the mean was close to the baseline established off treatment. urinary oxalate again fell 20% from baseline during the washout period. calcium oxalate supersaturation was reduced while on oxadrop, largely due to the decrease in oxalate excretion, although mean changes did not reach statistical significance. conclusion: manipulation of gastrointestinal (gi) flora can influence urinary oxalate excretion to reduce urinary supersaturation levels. these changes could have a salutary effect on stone formation rates. further studies will be needed to establish the optimal dosing regimen.

TI  == expression of a heterologous manganese superoxide dismutase gene in intestinal lactobacilli provides protection against hydrogen peroxide toxicity.
AB  == in living organisms, exposure to oxygen provokes oxidative stress. a widespread mechanism for protection against oxidative stress is provided by the antioxidant  enzymes: superoxide dismutases (sods) and hydroperoxidases. generally, these enzymes are not present in lactobacillus spp. in this study, we examined the potential advantages of providing a heterologous sod to some of the intestinal lactobacilli. thus, the gene encoding the manganese-containing sod (soda) was cloned from streptococcus thermophilus ao54 and expressed in four intestinal lactobacilli. a 1.2-kb pcr product containing the soda gene was cloned into the shuttle vector ptrk563, to yield psoda, which was functionally expressed and complemented an escherichia coli strain deficient in mn and fesods. the plasmid,  psoda, was subsequently introduced and expressed in lactobacillus gasseri nck334, lactobacillus johnsonii nck89, lactobacillus acidophilus nck56, and lactobacillus reuteri nck932. molecular and biochemical analyses confirmed the presence of the  gene (soda) and the expression of an active gene product (mnsod) in these strains of lactobacilli. the specific activities of mnsod were 6.7, 3.8, 5.8, and 60.7 u/mg of protein for l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. reuteri, respectively. the expression of s. thermophilus mnsod in l. gasseri and l. acidophilus provided protection against hydrogen peroxide stress. the data show that mnsod protects cells against hydrogen peroxide by removing o(2)(.-) and preventing the redox cycling of iron. to our best knowledge, this is the first report of a soda from s. thermophilus being expressed in other lactic acid bacteria.

AB  == twenty-three of 86 strains of lactic acid bacteria transformed linoleic acid into hydroxy fa. two distinct conversion pathways were in operation. two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus and a strain of pediococcus pentosaceus produced 13(s)-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic acid 113(s)-oh 18:11 and 10,13dihydroxyoctadecanoic  acid (10,13-oh 18:0) as main and minor products, respectively, whereas 13 strains, including l. casei subsp. casei, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. lactis subsp. cremoris, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus produced 10-hydroxy-12-octadecenoic acid (10-oh 18:1). seven strains of l. plantarum converted linoleic acid to 10-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid (10-oh 18:0) through 10-oh 18:1. linoleic acid at 2 g/l was converted by l. acidophilus  ifo13951t to 1.3 g of 13(s)-oh 18:1 and 0.09 g of 10,13-oh 18:0 in 7 d. lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei jcm 1111 produced 10-oh 18:1 in 91% yield, and l. plantarum jcm 8341, 10-oh 18:0 in 59% yield from linoleic acid (2 g/l) under optimal conditions. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the  production of 13(s)-oh 18:1 by lactic acid bacteria other than ruminal bacteria,  and of 10,13-oh 18:0 by any bacteria.

TI  == randomised clinical trial of synbiotic therapy in elective surgical patients.
AB  == background: it is possible to manipulate the composition of the gastrointestinal  microflora by administration of pre- and probiotics. this may help to preserve gut barrier function and reduce the incidence of septic morbidity. aims: to assess the effects of a combination of pre- and probiotics (synbiotic) on bacterial translocation, gastric colonisation, systemic inflammation, and septic  morbidity in elective surgical patients. patients: patients were enrolled two weeks prior to elective abdominal surgery. seventy two patients were randomised to the synbiotic group and 65 to the placebo group. patients were well matched regarding age and sex distribution, diagnoses, and possum scores. methods: patients in the synbiotic group received a two week preoperative course of lactobacillus acidophilus la5, bifidobacterium lactis bb-12, streptococcus thermophilus, and lactobacillus bulgaricus, together with the prebiotic oligofructose. patients in the placebo group received placebo capsules and sucrose powder. at surgery, a nasogastric aspirate, mesenteric lymph node, and scrapings of the terminal ileum were harvested for microbiological analysis. serum was collected preoperatively and on postoperative days 1 and 7 for measurement of c reactive protein, interleukin 6, and antiendotoxin antibodies. septic morbidity and mortality were recorded. results: there were no significant  differences between the synbiotic and control groups in bacterial translocation (12.1% v 10.7%; p = 0.808, chi(2)), gastric colonisation (41% v 44%; p = 0.719),  systemic inflammation, or septic complications (32% v 31%; p = 0.882). conclusions: in this study, synbiotics had no measurable effect on gut barrier function in elective surgical patients. further studies investigating the place of pre- and probiotics in clinical practice are required.

AB  == nineteen bacteriological media were evaluated to assess their suitability to selectively enumerate lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, and propionibacteria. bacteriological media evaluated included streptococcus thermophilus agar, ph modified mrs agar, mrs-vancomycine agar, mrs-bile agar, mrs-nacl agar, mrs-lithium chloride agar, mrs-nnlp (nalidixic acid, neomycin sulfate, lithium chloride and paramomycine sulfate) agar, reinforced clostridial agar, sugar-based (such as maltose, galactose, sorbitol, manitol, esculin) media, sodium lactate agar, arabinose agar, raffinose agar, xylose agar, and l. casei agar. incubations were carried out under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 27, 30, 37, 43, and 45 degrees c for 24, 72 h, and 7 to 9 d. s. thermophilus agar and aerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 h were suitable for s. thermophilus. l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus could be enumerated using mrs agar (ph 4.58 or ph 5.20) and under anaerobic incubation at 45 degrees c for 72 h. mrs-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 43 degrees c for 72 h were suitable to enumerate l. rhamnosus. mrs-vancomycine agar and anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 72 h were selective for l. casei. to estimate the counts of l. casei by subtraction method, counts of l. rhamnosus on mrs-vancomycine agar at 43 degrees c for 72 h under anaerobic incubation could be subtracted from total counts of l. casei and l. rhamnosus enumerated on mrs-vancomycine agar at 37 degrees c for 72 h under anaerobic incubation. l. acidophilus could be enumerated using mrs-agar at 43 degrees c for 72 h or basal agar-maltose agar at 43 degrees c for 72 h or ba-sorbitol agar at 37 degrees c for 72 h, under anaerobic incubation. bifidobacteria could be enumerated on mrs-nnlp agar under anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 72 h. propionibacteria could be enumerated on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees c for 7 to 9 d. a subtraction method was most suitable for counting propionibacteria in the presence of other lactic acid bacteria from a product. for this method, counts of lactic bacteria at d 3 on sodium lactate agar under anaerobic incubation at 30 degrees c were subtracted from counts at d 7 of lactic bacteria and propionibacteria.

TI  == [evaluation of the activity of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt].
AB  == the effect of probiotic cultures over listeria monocytogenes during the production and storage of yogurt was evaluated. a yogurt mixture (10.6% non-fat solid liquids, 3% fat and 0.3% gelatin) was prepared, homogenized and pasteurized. yogurt was inoculated with 0, 10(2), 10(4) and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. monocytogenes and 0.02% of traditional lactic culture yc 180 (streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus) and probiotic culture aby-1 (bifidobacterium longum, b. bifidum, b, infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus y lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). it was incubated for 3 h at 43 degrees c until ph reached an approximate value of 4.8, followed by refrigeration at 5 degrees c for 21 days. during fermentation, samples were taken every hour, and during storage every 3 days, analyzing ph and  lactic, bifidobacteria and pathogen count for each time. it was demonstrated that there was no significant simple effect for the type of culture used (aby-1 and yc 180) (p = 0.684) over the amount of l. monocytogenes present in yogurt during the fermentation and storage periods. the presence of bifidobacteria in the aby-1 culture did not present a significant effect over l. monocytogenes. neither the effect of time presented a significant effect over l. monocytogenes (p = 0.448).  in this case, the aby-1 and yc 180 cultures present a bacteriostatic effect over  the pathogen. the probiotic cultures had a bacteriostatic but not bactericidal effect over l. monocytogenes. this is not related to the protective effect of these cultures in bowel, since in-vivo conditions favor the production of antimicrobial substances, such as bacteriocins that act over pathogens.

TI  == the effect of temperature and ph on the growth of lactic acid bacteria: a ph-auxostat study.
AB  == the growth of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a ph-auxostat. the computer-controlled smooth change of ph or temperature was used to study the effect of ph and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield y(atp) and specific lactate production rate q(atp)). the behaviour of mu and q(atp) with an increase of temperature suggested that atp production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the decrease of y(atp) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while q(atp) remained constant or even increased. with the decrease of ph, decrease of both y(atp) and q(atp) was observed. s. thermophilus st20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees c was the most acid sensitive strain. the l. paracasei e1h3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to ph change. the behaviour of mixed culture of l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus in milk in a ph-auxostat with ph-decrease was in agreement with the  pure culture experiments of the same species. the study showed that ph-auxostat with smooth controlled change of ph and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of lab.

TI  == live probiotics protect intestinal epithelial cells from the effects of infection with enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec).
AB  == background: the colonic epithelium maintains a life long reciprocally beneficial  interaction with the colonic microbiota. disruption is associated with mucosal injury. aims: we hypothesised that probiotics may limit epithelial damage induced by enteroinvasive pathogens, and promote restitution. methods: human intestinal epithelial cell lines (ht29/cl.19a and caco-2) were exposed to enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec 029:nm), and/or probiotics (streptococcus thermophilus (st), atcc19258, and lactobacillus acidophilus (la), atcc4356). infected cells and controls were assessed for transepithelial resistance, chloride secretory responses, alterations in cytoskeletal and tight junctional proteins, and responses to epidermal growth factor (egf) stimulation. results: exposure of cell monolayers to live st/la, but not to heat inactivated st/la, significantly limited adhesion, invasion, and physiological dysfunction induced by eiec. antibiotic killed st/la reduced adhesion somewhat but were less effective in limiting the consequences of eiec invasion of cell monolayers. furthermore, live  st/la alone increased transepithelial resistance, contrasting markedly with the fall in resistance evoked by eiec infection, which could also be blocked by live  st/la. the effect of st/la on resistance was accompanied by maintenance (actin, zo-1) or enhancement (actinin, occludin) of cytoskeletal and tight junctional protein phosphorylation. st/la had no effect on chloride secretion by themselves  but reversed the increase in basal secretion evoked by eiec. eiec also reduced the ability of egf to activate its receptor, which was reversed by st/la. conclusions: live st/la interact with intestinal epithelial cells to protect them from the deleterious effect of eiec via mechanisms that include, but are not limited to, interference with pathogen adhesion and invasion. probiotics likely also enhance the barrier function of naive epithelial cells not exposed to any pathogen.

TI  == influence of the oral administration of lactic acid bacteria on iga producing cells associated to bronchus.
AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

TI  == intestinal pathway of internalisation of lactic acid bacteria and gut mucosal immunostimulation.
AB  == the induction of the gut mucosal immune response is dependent on the antigen interacting with the m cells of peyer's patches and with the immune cells associated with this lymphoid organ. in previous studies we showed that the mucosal immunostimulation by lab varied depending upon the strain being studied.  some of them increased the inflammatory immune response and others enhanced the level of secretory antibody (s-iga). our aim was to determine the pathway of the  internalisation of lab strains in the intestine, to provide a basis for understing the different behaviour exhibited by them. the presence of lab on peyer's patches or in the immune cells associated with the villi of small intestine was determined using fluorescein-labelled bacteria and by transmission  electron microscopy. mice were dosed orally by intubation, with 10<sup>1</sup> cells of labelled single strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus. for electron microscopy studies unlabelled bacteria were used. histological preparations of the small and large intestine were performed 1 hour  after administration of the bacteria. fluorescent bacteria of l. casei and s. thermophilus were found only in peyer's patches while l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus were observed in peyer's patches and in the small intestine. l. acidophilus was also found in the large intestine. we confirmed these findings by electron microscopy. we determined that for l. casei the pathway of internalisation was via the m and fae cells of peyer's patches, while  for s. thermophilus, l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus the interaction with the immune cells of peyer's patches was through the follicle associated epithelium (fae). l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus also interacted with the epithelial cells of the small intestine and l. acidophilus with epithelial cells of the large intestine. these results suggest that the different effects of lab on the mucosal immunostimulation, are related to the different pathways of gut internalisation used to take contact with the immune cells associated with the lamina propria intestinal.

TI  == interaction of lactic acid bacteria with the gut immune system.
AB  == health claims of lactic acid bacteria (lab) used in functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are based on the capacity of these microorganisms to  stimulate the host immune system. in this study, the antigenic effect of lab (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus) on the gut immune system of balb/c mice was evaluated. a dose-dependent increase of the bcl2 protein was observed with all lab assayed. furthermore, the analysis of cytokine-producing cells in the lamina propria of gut showed that tnfalpha and infgamma values, determined in macrophages cultured from peyer patches, were enhanced for all the lab assayed. an important increase of interleukins il-10 and il-4 was observed mainly in mice  fed with lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus or lactobacillus casei, while  a significant induction of il-2 and il-12 was only observed with l. acidophilus (p<0.01). these effects were dose dependent. the role of produced cytokines in the balance th1/th2 was determined by a systemic antibody response against parenterally injected ovoalbumin. l. casei, l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus enhanced the igg1 response favouring th2 balance, while l. acidophilus also increased the igg2a response inducing th1 balance. s. thermophilus did not influence the balance th1/th2. our studies showed that lactic acid bacteria induce distinct mucosal cytokine profiles showing different  adjuvant capacity among them. thus, selection of probiotic strain with immunological properties must be well defined to influence cytokine expression that favour the claimed immune response.

TI  == ingested probiotics reduce nasal colonization with pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci).
AB  == background: as a bacterial reservoir, the nose may harbor potentially pathogenic  bacteria (ppb: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and haemophilus influenzae). in patients carrying ppb, antiseptic regimens could be crucial for infection control after major operations on or injuries of the head, nasal sinuses, or lungs. such regimens may also be important for diabetic patients and persons receiving hemodialysis, in intensive  care units, or with impaired immunity due to various other causes. objective: we  tested a possible effect of the ingestion of probiotics on the bacterial flora of the nose. design: in an open, prospective trial, 209 volunteers were randomly assigned to consume either a probiotic, fermented milk drink [65 ml with lactobacillus gg (atcc 53103), bifidobacterium sp b420, lactobacillus acidophilus 145, and streptococcus thermophilus; n = 108] or standard yogurt (180 g; n = 101) daily for 3 wk. nasal microbial flora were analyzed on days 1, 21, and 28. the microbial examination was blinded to the source of the samples. results: we found a significant reduction (19%; p < 0.001) in the occurrence of nasal ppb in the group who consumed the probiotic drink but not in the group who consumed yogurt.  the effect was mainly on gram-positive bacteria, which decreased significantly (p < 0.05). conclusions: the results indicate that regular intake of probiotics can  reduce ppb in the upper respiratory tract. the results also indicate a linkage of the lymphoid tissue between the gut and the upper respiratory tract.

AB  == in the present work, the compared effect of milk base and starter culture on acidification, texture, growth, and stability of probiotic bacteria in fermented  milk processing, was studied. two strains of probiotic bacteria were used, lactobacillus acidophilus la5 and l. rhamnosus lr35, with two starter cultures. one starter culture consisted only of streptococcus thermophilus st7 (single starter culture); the other was a yogurt mixed culture with s. thermophilus st7 and l. bulgaricus lb12 (mixed starter culture). for the milk base preparation, four commercial dairy ingredients were tested (two milk protein concentrates and  two casein hydrolysates). the resulting fermented milks were compared to those obtained with control milk (without enrichment) and milk added with skim milk powder. the performance of the two probiotic strains were opposite. l. acidophilus la5 grew well on milk but showed a poor stability during storage. l.  rhamnosus lr35 grew weakly on milk but was remarkably stable during storage. with the strains tested in this study, the use of the single starter culture and the addition of casein hydrolysate gave the best probiotic cell counts. the fermentation time was of about 11 h, and the probiotic level after five weeks of  storage was greater than 106 cfu/ml for l. acidophilus la5 and 10(7) cfu/ml for l. rhamnosus lr35. however, an optimization of the level of casein hydrolysate added to milk base has to be done, in order to improve texture and flavor when using this dairy ingredient.

AB  == the objective of this research was to investigate the effect of a cyanobacterial  (spirulina platensis) biomass on the microflora of a probiotic fermented dairy product during storage at two temperatures. spirulina-enriched and control (plain) fermented acidophilus-bifidus-thermophilus (abt) milks were produced using a fast fermentation starter culture (abt-4) as the source of lactobacillus  acidophilus (a), bifidobacteria (b), and streptococcus thermophilus (t). incubation took 6 h at 40 degrees c. as for the cyanobacterial product, the s. platensis biomass was added to the process milk during stirring at ph 4.5 to 4.6. thereafter, the abt-type fermented milks were cooled to 25 degrees c in ice water, filled into sterile, tightly capped centrifuge tubes, further cooled at 4  degrees c for 24 h, and then stored either at 15 degrees c for 18 d or at 4 degrees c for 42 d. microbiological analyses and acidity measurements were performed at regular intervals. our results showed that the counts of the starter organisms were satisfactory during the entire storage period at both temperatures applied in this research. the s. platensis biomass had a beneficial effect on the survival of abt starter bacteria regardless of storage temperature. postacidification was observed at 15 degrees c, whereas ph remained stable during refrigerated storage at 4 degrees c. the abundance of bioactive substances in s.  platensis is of great importance from a nutritional point of view because thus the cyanobacterial biomass provides a new opportunity for the manufacture of functional dairy foods.

TI  == evolution of carbohydrate fraction in carbonated fermented milks as affected by beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains.
AB  == the influence of carbonation on the evolution of lactose, galactose and glucose in fermented milks with added probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus and/or bifidobacterium bifidum) was evaluated and related to beta-galactosidase activity of starter strains. during incubation and  first days of refrigeration, lactose hydrolysis resulting in the liberation of galactose and glucose occurred in ct (streptococcus thermophilus/lb. casei), at (str. thermophilus/lb. acidophilus) and abt fermented milks (str. thermophilus/lb. acidophilus/bifid. bifidum). levels of galactose were higher than those of glucose and could be related to the preferential consumption of glucose by actively growing bacteria. through the incubation, lactose and monosaccharide levels were not affected by milk carbonation. however, during refrigerated storage the presence of this gas was associated with slightly lower  content of lactose and higher levels of galactose and glucose in at and abt products but not in ct fermented milks. through the refrigeration galactose was moderately utilised by lb. acidophilus in at products whereas the presence of bifid. bifidum seems to prevent the consumption of this sugar in abt fermented milks. glucose remained constant, with minor variations in ct products but a continuous increase of this sugar occurred in carbonated at and abt fermented milks during storage. beta-galactosidase activity displayed by str. thermophilus  strains was similar at ph 6.5 (initial ph of non-carbonated samples) and ph 6.3 (initial ph of carbonated samples) whereas lb. acidophilus laa3 showed greater beta-galactosidase activity at ph 6.3 than at higher ph values. thus, the enhanced metabolic activity of lb. acidophilus caused by the low initial ph of carbonated milk also promoted higher cellular beta-galactosidase activity that could have released greater amounts of galactose and glucose from lactose in at and abt fermented milks through the refrigerated period. in ct fermented milks, similar beta-galactosidase activity levels of str. thermophilus at ph 6.5 and 6.3 together with the absence of beta-galactosidase activity in lb. casei could explain the lack of differences on glucose and galactose content between carbonated and non-carbonated samples.

TI  == interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria used for fermented  dairy products.
AB  == interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria were investigated to establish adequate combinations of strains to manufacture probiotic dairy products. for this aim, a total of 48 strains of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and bifidobacterium spp. (eight of each) were used. the detection of bacterial interactions was carried out using the well-diffusion agar assay, and the interactions found were further characterized  by growth kinetics. a variety of interactions was demonstrated. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was found to be able to inhibit s. thermophilus strains. among  probiotic cultures, lb. acidophilus was the sole species that was inhibited by the others (lb. casei and bifidobacterium). in general, probiotic bacteria proved to be more inhibitory towards lactic acid bacteria than vice versa since the latter did not exert any effect on the growth of the former, with some exceptions. the study of interactions by growth kinetics allowed the setting of four different kinds of behaviors between species of lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria (stimulation, delay, complete inhibition of growth, and no effects among them). the possible interactions among the strains selected to manufacture a probiotic fermented dairy product should be taken into account when choosing the best combination/s to optimize their performance in the process and  their survival in the products during cold storage.

AB  == background: current antibiotic treatment for helicobacter pylori infection is often associated with frequent adverse effects and resistance to antibiotics. alternative treatment methods to control h. pylori infection are needed. some specific strains of lactic acid bacteria (probiotics) in dairy products are known to inhibit the growth of h. pylori in vitro. a clinical trial was conducted to see the efficacy of a specially designed yogurt product containing specific probiotics on the eradication of h. pylori. method: the yogurt was prepared using three lactobacillus spp. (l. acidophilus and l. casei) and one commercial starter culture (l. acidophilus, l. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus). all these cultures were previously evaluated, and found to have strong in vitro inhibitory  effects on the growth of h. pylori. twenty-seven asymptomatic women positive for  h. pylori on gastric biopsy and 13c urea breath test were recruited, and administered 175 ml of the yogurt three times a day for 30 days. the 13c urea breath test was administered again, one month after stopping the yogurt treatment to detect the presence of h. pylori. results: in 26 of 27 subjects, the urea breath test values remained positive, indicating that the consumption of the yogurt had no effect on the eradication of h. pylori. conclusion: although the designed fermented milk containing lactobacilli is very effective in the inhibition of h. pylori growth in vitro, eradication of this infection in humans  is difficult to achieve by consuming this product.

TI  == enteroinvasive bacteria alter barrier and transport properties of human intestinal epithelium: role of inos and cox-2.
AB  == background & aims: various invasive pathogens cause diarrhea, but the mechanism(s) are poorly understood. we hypothesized that nitric oxide and prostaglandins might modulate chloride secretory and barrier properties of the infected intestinal epithelium and that diarrhea is caused, in part, by altered expression of inducible no synthase (inos) and cyclooxygenase 2 (cox-2). methods: studies were conducted in human intestinal epithelial cell lines (ht29/cl.19a, caco-2, and t84). cells were infected with enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec  029:nm) or salmonella dublin (sd), or nonpathogenic, noninvasive bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus [st] and lactobacillus acidophilus [la]). infected cells and controls were tested for transepithelial resistance, chloride secretion, prostaglandin e2, guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, and protein expression. results: cells infected with  eiec or sd, but not uninfected controls or st/la-exposed monolayers, showed a progressive reduction in transepithelial resistance starting at 6-12 hours. infected ht29/cl.19a and caco-2 cells, but not t84 cells, also showed an increase in total nitrite. expression of inos, and consequently cox-2, was also increased, followed by increased production of prostaglandins and cyclic nucleotides. furthermore, basal and stimulated chloride secretory responses to various agonists were enhanced in ht29/cl.19a and caco-2 cells after infection with enteroinvasive bacteria, and this effect was reversed for some agonists by inos or cox-2 inhibitors. increased expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and nkcc1 was also observed in eiec or sd-infected cells vs. controls, secondary to no synthase activity. conclusions: up-regulation of inos and cox-2 by enteroinvasive bacteria can modulate chloride secretion and barrier function in intestinal epithelial cells. thus, these enzymes represent possible therapeutic targets in infectious diarrhea.

TI  == evolution of the lactic acid bacterial community during malt whisky fermentation: a polyphasic study.
AB  == the development of the lactic acid bacterial community in a commercial malt whisky fermentation occurred in three broad phases. initially, bacteria were inhibited by strong yeast growth. fluorescence microscopy and environmental scanning electron microscopy revealed, in this early stage, both cocci and rods that were at least partly derived from the wort and yeast but also stemmed from the distillery plant. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of partial 16s rrna genes and sequence analysis revealed cocci related to streptococcus thermophilus or saccharococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus brevis, and lactobacillus fermentum. the middle phase began 35 to 40 h after yeast inoculation and was characterized by exponential growth of lactobacilli and residual yeast metabolism. lactobacillus casei or lactobacillus paracasei, l. fermentum, and lactobacillus ferintoshensis were detected in samples of fermenting wort examined by dgge during this stage. bacterial growth was accompanied by the accumulation of acetic and lactic acids and the metabolism of  residual maltooligosaccharides. by 70 h, two new pcr bands were detected on dgge  gels, and the associated bacteria were largely responsible for the final phase of the fermentation. the bacteria were phylogenetically related to lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii, and strains similar to the former had  previously been recovered from malt whisky fermentations in japan. these were probably obligately homofermentative bacteria, required malt wort for growth, and could not be cultured on normal laboratory media, such as mrs. their metabolism during the last 20 to 30 h of fermentation was associated with yeast death and autolysis and further accumulation of lactate but no additional acetate.

AB  == background: hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for renal stones, and in most cases, it appears to be sustained by increased dietary load or increased intestinal absorption. previous studies have shown that components of the endogenous digestive microflora, in particular oxalobacter formigenes, utilize oxalate in the gut, thus limiting its absorption. we tested the hypothesis of whether oxaluria can be reduced by means of reducing intestinal absorption through feeding a mixture of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. methods: six patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis and mild hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/24 h) received daily a mixture containing 8 x 10(11) freeze-dried lactic acid  bacteria (l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. brevis, s. thermophilus, b. infantis)  for four weeks. the 24-hour urinary excretion of oxalate was determined at the end of the study period and then one month after ending the treatment. the ability of bacteria to degrade oxalate and grow in oxalate-containing media, and  the gene expression of ox1t, an enzyme that catalyzes the transmembrane exchange  of oxalate, also were investigated. results: the treatment resulted in a great reduction of the 24-hour excretion of oxalate in all six patients enrolled. mean  levels +/- sd were 33.5 +/- 15.9 mg/24 h at the end of the study period and 28.3  +/- 14.6 mg/24 h one month after treatment was interrupted compared with baseline values of 55.5 +/- 19.6 mg/24 h (p < 0.05). the treatment was associated with a strong reduction of the fecal excretion of oxalate in the two patients tested. two bacterial strains among those used for the treatment (l. acidophilus and s. thermophilus) proved in vitro to degrade oxalate effectively, but their growth was somewhat inhibited by oxalate. one strain (b. infantis) showed a quite good degrading activity and grew rapidly in the oxalate-containing medium. l. plantarum and l. brevis showed a modest ability to degrade oxalate even though they grew significantly in oxalate-containing medium. no strain expressed the ox1t gene. conclusions: the urinary excretion of oxalate, a major risk factor for renal stone formation and growth in patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis, can be greatly reduced with treatment using a high concentration of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. we postulate that the biological manipulation  of the endogenous digestive microflora can be a novel approach for the prevention of urinary stone formation.

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the  indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

TI  == formulations and processing of yogurt affect the microbial quality of carbonated  yogurt.
AB  == carbonation, flavor, culture type, ph, and storage time were varied to investigate the effects of these variables and their interactions on the growth of both typical and nontypical yogurt cultures and some contaminating bacteria. two types of yogurt cultures (yc-470 and yc-180) were used as the source of typical yogurt bacteria, streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. in addition, lactobacillus acidophilus (la-k) and bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707 were added as nontypical yogurt cultures to make sweetened low fat (1%) swiss-style plain, strawberry, and lemon yogurts. samples were incubated at 43 degrees c until ph values of 5.0 or 4.2 were reached. strawberry yogurts at low (4.2) and high (5.0) phs were divided into three portions, which were separately inoculated with contaminating bacteria, bacillus licheniformis atcc 14580, escherichia coli atcc 11775, and listeria monocytogenes scott a. after incorporation of carbon dioxide (1.10 to 1.27 volume of co2 gas dissolved in water), the yogurt was stored at 4 degrees c for a 90-d period. carbon dioxide did not affect the growth of typical or nontypical yogurt  bacteria. also, co2 did not inhibit the growth of undesirable microorganisms. in  general, low levels of co2 did not affect the bacterial population in yogurt. the microflora of yogurt were influenced by culture type, ph, flavor type, and storage time or their interactions.

TI  == effects of ingestion of yogurts containing bifidobacterium and lactobacillus acidophilus on spleen and peyer's patch lymphocyte populations in the mouse.
AB  == certain probiotic lactic acid bacteria have been reported to improve immune system function. here, the effects of ingesting yogurts on lymphocyte populations in the spleens and peyer's patches were determined in mice. three probiotic-supplemented yogurts containing streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, bifidobacterium, and lactobacillus acidophilus and one  conventional yogurt containing only s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus were prepared from commercial starter cultures and used in the study. b6c3f1 female mice were fed the four different types of yogurts mixed with an ain-93g diet in a 50:50 (wt/wt) ratio. nonfat dry milk mixed at a 50:50 (wt/wt) ratio with ain-93g  diet was used as the control. after a 14-day feeding period, spleen and peyer's patches were removed and lymphocytes subjected to phenotype analysis by flow cytometry. ingestion of the four yogurts had no effect on percentages of cd8+ (cytotoxic t cells), b220+ (b cells), iga+, or igm+ cells in spleen or peyer's patches. the percentage of cd4+ (t helper) cells was significantly increased in the spleens from one group of mice fed a yogurt containing bifidobacterium and l. acidophilus, and a similar trend was found in the remaining two probiotic-supplemented yogurts. effects on cd4+ populations were not observed in  spleens of mice fed conventional yogurt or in the peyer's patches of any of the four yogurt groups. in total, the results suggested that ingestion of conventional or probiotic-supplemented yogurts for 2 weeks had very little effect on lymphocyte distribution in the systemic or mucosal immune compartments.

TI  == influence of a probiotic yoghurt on the status of vitamins b(1), b(2) and b(6) in the healthy adult human.
AB  == background/aims: the main reason for this study was to determine whether yoghurt  bacteria, being rich in some water-soluble vitamins, release them or utilize vitamins from their surroundings. our study was trying to determine for the first time, if the viable bacteria of probiotic yoghurt are able to influence the parameters of the b-vitamin (b(1), b(2), b(6)) status of the healthy adult human. methods: the test yoghurt was commercially available probiotic yoghurt prepared with streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus acidophilus, enriched with lactobacillus casei gg. different chemical forms of all investigated b-vitamins were determined by hplc methods. in order to determine the influence of the yoghurt flora, each of 12 subjects consumed four yoghurt portions 125 g each ( =  500 g) a day, containing thermally inactivated cultures during the first 2-week period and yoghurt without heat treatment during the second 2-week period. results: the heat treatment of the probiotic yoghurt caused negligible changes in vitamin contents. the plasma levels of thiamin decreased significantly (p < 0.01) after the first 2-week period and kept on decreasing during the second 2-week period. a similar trend was found in the urinary excretion. the plasma levels of  the b(2)-vitamers were different. the flavin adenine dinucleotide concentrations  increased significantly (p < 0.01) after the consumption of heat-treated yoghurt  and decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after the following 2 weeks, in which the  subjects received the untreated yoghurt. in contrast, the flavin mononucleotide plasma levels decreased during the first 2-week period and increased during the second part of the study, but the change was not statistically significant. the free riboflavin concentrations in plasma and urine showed a continuous but not significant increase. the concentrations of pyridoxal-5-phosphate in plasma increased after the consumption of yoghurt with the inactivated bacteria and decreased in the second part of the study. however, the differences were not significant. the excretion of thiamin, b(2)- and b(6)-vitamers in the faeces did  not significantly change throughout the study period (p>0.05). conclusions: our observations show that the bacterial flora of the examined yoghurt does not influence the vitamin b(1), b(2) and b(6) status of man. it seems likely that even lactobacilli of the 'probiotic' type which are vitamin b consumers can decrease the bioavailability of these vitamins for man. obviously a thermal death of the cells did not induce a release of physiologically active vitamins.

TI  == gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

TI  == viability of probiotic (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in argentinian fresco cheese.
AB  == we evaluated the suitability of argentinian fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. we used cultures of bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), bifidobacterium longum (two strains), bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms,  yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had  a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == probiotic culture survival and implications in fermented frozen yogurt characteristics.
AB  == low-fat ice cream mix was fermented with probiotic-supplemented and traditional starter culture systems and evaluated for culture survival, composition, and sensory characteristics of frozen product. fermentations were stopped when the titratable acidity reached 0.15% greater than the initial titratable acidity (end point 1) or when the ph reached 5.6 (end point 2). mix was frozen and stored for  11 wk at -20 degrees c. the traditional yogurt culture system contained the strains streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii  ssp. bulgaricus. the probiotic-supplemented system contained the traditional cultures as well as bifidobacterium longum and lactobacillus acidophilus. we compared recovery of bifodobacterium by three methods, a repair-detection system  with roll-tubes and plates on modified bifid glucose medium and plates with maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial medium. culture bacteria in both systems did not decrease in the yogurt during frozen storage. the roll-tube method with modified bifid glucose agar and repair detection system provided at least one-half log10 cfu/ml higher recovery of b. longum compared with recoveries using modified bifid glucose agar or maltose + galactose reinforced clostridial agar on petri plates. no change in concentrations of lactose or protein for products fermented with either culture system occurred during storage. acid flavor was more intense when product was fermented to ph 5.6, but yogurt flavor was not intensified. the presence of probiotic bacteria in the supplemented system seemed to cause no differences in protein and lactose concentration and sensory characteristics.

TI  == effect of 8 week intake of probiotic milk products on risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effect of a probiotic milk product containing the culture causido(r) and of two alternative products on risk factors for cardiovascular disease in overweight and obese subjects. design: an 8 week randomized, double-blind, placebo- and compliance-controlled, parallel study. subjects: seventy healthy, weight-stable, overweight and obese (25.0<bmi<37.5 kg/m2) males (n=20) and females (n=50), 18-55 y old, were randomly assigned into  five groups. intervention: four groups consumed 450 ml fermented milk products (yoghurt) daily. group 1: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of streptococcus thermophilus and two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus (stla). group 2: a placebo yoghurt fermented with delta-acid-lactone (py). group 3: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of streptococcus thermophilus and one strain of lactobacillus rhamnosus (stlr). group 4: a yoghurt fermented with one strain of enterococcus faecium and two strains of streptococcus thermophilus (causido(r) culture), gaio(r) (g). the dietary composition of the yoghurt was otherwise similar. the fifth group was given two placebo pills (pp) daily. results: when comparing all five treatment groups, unadjusted for changes in body weight, no statistical effects were observed in week 8 in the g-group on low density lipoproteins (ldl)-cholesterol (p=0.29). after adjustment for small changes in body weight, ldl-cholesterol decreased by 8.4% (0.26+/-0.10 mmol/l; p<0.05) and fibrinogen increased (0.74+/-0.32 mmol/l; p<0.05) after 8 weeks in the g-group. this was significantly different from the group consuming chemically fermented yoghurt and the group consuming placebo pills (p<0.05). after 8 weeks, systolic blood pressure was significantly more reduced in the stla and g-group compared to stlr. no other differences were found. conclusion: the causido(r) culture reduced ldl-cholesterol and increased fibrinogen in the overweight subjects at a 450 ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. the effect on ldl-cholesterol confirms previous studies. an immunostimulation by one of the strains in the product might explain  the effect on fibrinogen in the g-group. sponsorship: md foods a/s, denmark.

TI  == a probiotic strain of l. acidophilus reduces dmh-induced large intestinal tumors  in male sprague-dawley rats.
AB  == probiotic bacteria strains were examined for their influence on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh)-induced intestinal tumors in 100 male sprague-dawley  rats. lactobacillus acidophilus (delvo pro la-1), lactobacillus rhamnosus (gg), bifidobacterium animalis (cscc1941), and streptococcus thermophilus (dd145) strains were examined for their influence when added as freeze-dried bacteria to  an experimental diet based on a high-fat semipurified (ain-93) rodent diet. four  bacterial treatments were compared: l. acidophilus, l. acidophilus + b. animalis, l. rhamnosus, and s. thermophilus, the bacteria being added daily at 1% freeze-dried weight (10(10) colony-forming units/g) to the diet. trends were observed in the incidence of rats with large intestinal tumors for three treatments: 25% lower than control for l. acidophilus, 20% lower for l. acidophilus + b. animalis and l. rhamnosus treatments, and 10% lower for s. thermophilus. large intestinal tumor burden was significantly lower for treated rats with l. acidophilus than for the control group (10 and 3 tumors/treatment group, respectively, p = 0.05). large intestinal tumor mass index was also lower  for the l. acidophilus treatment than for control (1.70 and 0.10, respectively, p < 0.05). other treatments showed no statistically significant change from control for these indexes of tumorigenesis. for rats fed l. acidophilus, no adenocarcinomas were present in the colons. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of bacterial chromosomal dna fragments was used to differentiate introduced (exogenous) bacterial strains from indigenous bacteria of the same genera present in the feces. survival during gut passage and displacement of indigenous lactobacilli occurred with introduced l. acidophilus and l. rhamnosus gg during the probiotic treatment period. however, introduced strains of b. animalis and s. thermophilus were not able to be isolated from feces. it is concluded that this strain of l. acidophilus supplied as freeze-dried bacteria in the diet was protective, as seen by a small but significant inhibition of tumors within the rat colon.

TI  == proinflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide induction in murine macrophages by cell wall and cytoplasmic extracts of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. gasseri, l. helveticus, l. reuteri, and  streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (no) production were examined  in the raw 264.7 macrophage cell line. a similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and peyer's patch cells. both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) il-6, and no. pronounced enhancement of il-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. based on the  results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and  no, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == modulation of nonspecific mechanisms of defense by lactic acid bacteria: effective dose.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a fermented milk product containing lactobacillus johnsonii la1 (formerly known as lactobacillus acidophilus la1) on the phagocytic activity of peripheral blood leukocytes in healthy adult volunteers. furthermore, we sought to define the effective doses of the bacteria, examine the effect on respiratory burst activity, and, finally, examine the contribution made by the starter culture to the biological effects. volunteers were randomly distributed among three groups; each subject received one pot (150 ml) of fermented milk each day for 3 wk. the first two groups received a freshly prepared product fermented by streptococcus thermophilus (group a) alone or s. thermophilus and 10(7) cfu/ml l. johnsonii la1 (group b). group c received a product stored for a period of 21 to 28 d and that contained s. thermophilus and 10(6) cfu/ml of l. johnsonii la1. ingestion of l. johnsonii la1 did not significantly increase fecal lactobacilli counts. however, l. johnsonii la1 was able to survive intestinal transit and was only recovered from  the feces of the volunteers of groups b and c. the fermented base alone showed a  weak effect on respiratory burst but not on phagocytic activity. however, the product containing 10(7) cfu/ml l. johnsonii la1 significantly enhanced both functions. the product containing 10(6) cfu/ml of l. johnsonii la1 had no significant effect on either function. these results suggest that fecal persistence may not necessarily reflect in vivo colonization and may not be a prerequisite for all forms of immune reactivity.

TI  == ingestion of yogurt containing lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium to potentiate immunoglobulin a responses to cholera toxin in mice.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria have been reported to have benefits for the prevention and treatment of some forms of diarrhea and related conditions. to determine whether  these effects might involve direct stimulation of the gastrointestinal immune response, we administered yogurt to try to enhance mucosal and systemic antibodies against an orally presented immunogen, cholera toxin. yogurts were manufactured with starter cultures containing different species and strains of lactic acid bacteria. mice were fed these yogurts for 3 wk, during which they were also orally immunized twice with 10 micrograms of cholera toxin. blood was collected on d 0 and 21, and fecal pellets were collected weekly. mice that were  immunized orally with cholera toxin responded by producing specific intestinal and serum immunoglobulin (ig)a anti-cholera toxin. antibody responses of the iga  isotype were significantly increased in mice fed yogurts made with starters containing the conventional yogurt bacteria lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus supplemented with lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum, and bifidobacterium infantis. yogurt that was manufactured with starters containing only conventional yogurt bacteria produced  less iga anti-cholera toxin than did the control group fed nonfat dry milk. although strong responses were also observed for igg anti-cholera toxin in serum, the responses did not differ among groups. thus, administration of yogurt supplemented with l. acidophilus and bifidobacterium spp. enhanced mucosal and systemic iga responses to the cholera toxin immunogen.

AB  == pure cultures of three species of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis and bif. bifidum), lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixed culture of  lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus were each enumerated on two differential media and six selective media for the enumeration of bifidobacteria. the appearance of the colonies on the differential media was as expected but when mixed cultures were present, it proved extremely difficult to distinguish one species from another. of the selective media, amc, rms, npnl and bl-og performed well in that they gave good recoveries of bifidobacteria and were inhibitory to the growth of lact. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lact. acidophilus. however, of these four media, amc was most convenient as it is based on a commercially available medium, whereas the others must be made up from individual constituents. the amc agar is thus a good choice for the routine enumeration of bifidobacteria from mixed cultures.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria growth promoters from spirulina platensis.
AB  == spirulina has been used for many years as human food because of its high protein  content and nutritional value. some strains also produce bioactive substances that may inhibit or promote microbial growth. lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus bulgaricus were grown in rich media, mrs and rm, as well as in minimal saline medium with and without addition of extracellular products obtained from a late log phase culture of spirulina platensis in zarrouk medium. in both mrs and rm media, the extracellular products significantly promote the growth of the lactic  acid bacteria assayed. this stimulatory effect was observed in media with ph adjusted to 5.3, 6.3 and 7.0. no effect was observed in minimal saline medium.

TI  == ingredient supplementation effects on viability of probiotic bacteria in yogurt.
AB  == the present investigation studied the effects of cysteine, whey powder, whey protein concentrate, acid casein hydrolysates, or tryptone on the viability of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacteria. changes in ph, titratable acidity, redox potential, and viability of bacteria were monitored during 24 h of fermentation and refrigerated storage (4 degrees c) of yogurt for 35 d. the incubation time that was needed to reach ph 4.5 was considerably affected by the added ingredients. also, the drop in ph or the increase in acidity and redox potential was dependent on the added ingredients. the addition of cysteine, whey protein concentrate, acid casein hydrolysates, or  tryptone improved the viability of bifidobacteria to a variable extent, but whey  powder failed to improve their viability. the morphology of s. thermophilus, as shown by electron microscopy, was affected by cysteine at 500 mg/l, possibly as a result of reduced redox potential. sodium dodecyl sulfate-page and amino acid analyses suggested that the nitrogen source in the form of peptides and amino acids improved the viability of bifidobacteria in yogurt made with a commercial abt (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacteria, and streptococcus thermophilus) starter culture, which showed a dramatic decline in the counts of this organism in previous studies.

TI  == conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in pcr amplification of lactic acid bacteria (lab). an appropriately-sized pcr product was obtained from lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ll43-1 and mg1363; lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris lc10-1, lc11-1, and  lc12-1; streptococcus thermophilus st1-1; enterococcus faecalis ef1-1; lactobacillus acidophilus la1-1; lactobacillus helveticus lh1-1; pediococcus pentosaceus pp1-1; and bifidobacterium animalis ba1-1. the pcr products were cloned and sequenced. the deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the human y-box factor. the amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also  highly conserved in the lab strains. it is possible, therefore, that this protein in lab may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an rna chaperone unwinding tightly folded rna molecules.

TI  == influence of yogurt and acidophilus yogurt on serum cholesterol levels in mice.
AB  == the effects of yogurt and acidophilus yogurt on the weight gain, serum cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and the numbers of fecal lactobacilli and coliforms were investigated in mice assigned to three dietary treatments for 56 d: 1) commercial rodent chow and water (control), 2) commercial rodent chow and yogurt  made from milk inoculated with a 3% (vol/vol) liquid culture of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (yogurt), and 3) commercial rodent chow plus yogurt made from milk inoculated with a 0.01% (wt/vol) freeze-dried culture of streptococcus thermophilus plus lactobacillus acidophilus. the weight gains of mice receiving yogurt or acidophilus yogurt were higher than those of the mice in the control group. the mean values for serum cholesterol concentrations and ldl cholesterol concentrations were significantly  decreased when acidophilus yogurt was fed on d 28 and 56. high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were not affected by yogurt or acidophilus yogurt. the highest number of fecal lactobacilli was found in mice receiving acidophilus yogurt, and the number of fecal coliforms of that group was also lower than in the other two groups.

TI  == survival of lactic acid bacteria in a dynamic model of the stomach and small intestine: validation and the effects of bile.
AB  == this study was conducted to validate a dynamic model of the stomach and small intestine to quantify the survival of lactic acid bacteria and to assess the influence of gastrointestinal secretions. the survival of a single strain of each of the following species, bifidobacterium bifidum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus, was measured under physiological conditions (e.g., peristalsis, changes in ph, and changes in concentrations of enzymes and bile) and were compared with data obtained from humans. no significant differences were found between the in vitro and in vivo data, indicating that the model has a predictive value for the survival of these  bacteria in humans. the survival of these strains of lactic acid bacteria in the  gastrointestinal model was investigated under two different conditions in the small intestine: simulation of physiological secretion of bile and low bile secretion. reductions in viability were significantly different between the bacterial species. the dose-response effect of bile on the survival of the tested bacteria was significant, demonstrating the bactericidal effect of bile salts. this study demonstrates the differences among bacterial species in their sensitivity to gastric and intestinal secretions.

TI  == pharmaceutical probiotics for the treatment of anaerobic and other infections.
AB  == pharmaceutical probiotics have been used as alternative treatments or preventative therapies for a variety of clinical diseases. the overuse of antibiotics and emergence of multiple-antibiotic resistant pathogens has refocused clinical attention on the field of probiotics. anaerobic infections which seem to respond well to probiotics are infections which involve the disruption of normal microbial flora. gastrointestinal infections (travelers' diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea,clostridium difficile disease, rotavirus diarrhea) have been studied using the following pharmaceutical probiotics:saccharomyces boulardii, lactobacillus casei gg, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, bifidobacterium bifidum, streptococcus thermophilus and enterococcus faecium. vaginitis has been experimentally studied  using l. acidophilus and l. casei gg. the efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of these various probiotics are reviewed. requirements for drug approval are similar for biologic probiotics and new drug entities and these requirements  involve preclinical tolerability studies, pharmacokinetic studies and large, well-controlled blinded clinical trials.

AB  == fifteen media were evaluated to determine their suitability for selective enumeration of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacteria using 5 to 6 strains of each of the four groups of organisms. streptococcus thermophilus agar was found to be suitable for selective enumeration of s. thermophilus under aerobic incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the mrs agar at ph 5.2 or reinforced clostridial agar at ph 5.3 could be used for the selective enumeration of l. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus when the incubation was carried out at 45 degrees c for > or = 72 h. however, the recovery of this organism was lower on mrs agar at  ph 5.2 or reinforced clostridial agar at ph 5.3 than that obtained on mrs agar. the recovery of l. acidophilus and bifidobacteria on mrs agar and mrs-maltose agar was similar; mrs-maltose agar could be used to enumerate total counts of l.  acidophilus and bifidobacteria. for selective enumeration of l. acidophilus, mrs-salicin agar or mrs-sorbitol agar could be used. for selective enumeration of bifidobacteria, mrs nnlp (nalidixic acid, neomycin sulfate, lithium chloride, and paromomycin sulfate) agar was suitable; however, determination of bifidobacteria  by differential counts between l. acidophilus enumerated on mrs-salicin agar or mrs-sorbitol agar and the total counts of l. acidophilus and bifidobacteria obtained from mrs-maltose agar resulted in higher recovery of some strains of bifidobacteria. other media that were evaluated in this study were not suitable for selective enumeration.

TI  == performance of commercial cultures in fluid milk applications.
AB  == six lactobacillus acidophilus, 5 bifidobacterium, and 6 streptococcus thermophilus strains were studied for characteristics that are important to activity and stability in unfermented fluid milk products. speciation, strain relatedness, frozen concentrate stability, bile sensitivity, and lactase activity were evaluated. the microbiological stability of a culture-containing fluid milk  product was also determined. two of the bifidobacteria cultures contained > 1 strain. some strains were shown to be closely related or identical by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of fragmented chromosomal dna. selective media that distinguished among all 3 added genera were identified. all lactobacilli and most of the bifidobacteria were resistant to bile concentrations varying from 1 to 3%, and all streptococci were sensitive to bile. lactase activities were highest for s. thermophilus strains, supporting use of this species in fluid milk and dairy products to aid in the digestion of lactose by consumers. the experimental product evaluated in this study contained 10(7) cfu/ml of both l. acidophilus and bifidobacterium spp. and 5 x 10(7) cfu/ml of s. thermophilus. lactic, but not psychrotrophic, populations were fairly stable during storage. the results suggest that milk formulated with high concentrations of three different genera of probiotic bacteria can be manufactured with commercial strains.

TI  == biotherapeutic agents. a neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. data sources: the medline database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and september 1995. search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, lactobacillus, saccharomyces, bifidobacterium, candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. the bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. study selection and data extraction: all placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. english-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. data synthesis: placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (lactobacillus caseigg, bifidobacterium longum, b longum with l acidophilus, and saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (bifidobacterium bifidum with streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent clostridium difficile disease (s  boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (enterococcus faecium  sf68, l caseigg, and s boulardii). there is also evidence for lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. few adverse effects have been reported. however, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. conclusions: there is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. in an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.

TI  == lactobacillus- and bifidobacterium-mediated antigenotoxicity in the colon of rats.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are proposed to have several beneficial effects, including the inactivation of carcinogens. we have studied the potential of lactobacillus acidophilus (from a commercially available yogurt), lactobacillus gasseri (p79), lactobacillus confusus (dsm20196), streptococcus thermophilus (ncim 50083), bifidobacterium breve and bifidobacterium longum (from human infant stool) to prevent the induction of dna damage by n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng, 7.5 mg/kg body wt) in colon cells of  the rat. using the new technique of single cell microgel electrophoresis, all investigated strains were antigenotoxic toward mnng after a single dose of 10(10) viable cells/kg body wt p.o. eight hours before the carcinogen. one-half and one-tenth of this initial dose resulted in a loss of protective activity. high doses of heat-treated l. acidophilus strains were also not antigenotoxic. one mechanism of the preventive effect could be that bacterial metabolites or components are responsible. accordingly, selected examples were investigated in vitro in colon cells of the rat. metabolically active l. acidophilus cells, as well as an acetone extract of the culture, prevented mnng-induced dna damage. different cell fractions from l. acidophilus (cytoplasm, cell wall skeleton, cell wall) were devoid of antigenotoxic activity, whereas the peptidoglycan fraction and whole freeze-dried cells were antigenotoxic. as a second carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh) was used. a dose- and time-response study was first performed to assess the effects of dmh in several segments of the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. exposure for 16 hours to 15 or 25 mg dmh/kg body wt  p.o. induced dna damage in cells of the distal colon of rats, whereas no cytotoxicity was seen. pretreatment orally with lab on four consecutive mornings  before dmh gavage (8 hours after the last lab application) revealed that l. acidophilus, l. confusus, l. gasseri, b. longum, and b. breve inhibited the genotoxic effect of dmh. one of four s. thermophilus and one of three lactobacillus delbrueckeii ssp. bulgaricus strains were also protective. heat-treated l. acidophilus did not inhibit dmh-induced genotoxicity. a few aliquots of the colon cells were processed immunohistochemically for the presence of the "proliferation cell nuclear antigen" (pcna). dmh treatment did not increase pcna, nor was there any modulation by lab. the effect of l. acidophilus  on foreign compound-metabolizing enzymes (phase i and phase ii) in liver and colon cells of rats revealed only one parameter to be modulated, namely, a two- to three-fold increase in the levels of nadph-cytochrome p-450 reductase. the meaning of this finding, in terms of possible chemoprevention by lab, remains unclear. in conclusion, our studies show that most, but not all, lab tested could strongly inhibit genotoxicity in the gi tract of the rat and that viable lab organisms are required for the protective effect in vivo. the comet assay technique is a powerful tool to elucidate such in vivo antigenotoxic activities in tumor target tissues.

TI  == role of intestinal bacteria in ileal ulcer formation in rats treated with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug.
AB  == the role of intestinal bacteria in induction and repression of ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with one of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids), 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl) thiophene (bfmet), was examined in this study. bfmet was administered by intragastric gavage once at doses of 500-1,500 mg/kg of body weight to wistar rats treated with and without antibiotics (bacitracin, neomycin, streptomycin), germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats, and 72 hr later their gastrointestinal tracts were examined for ulcer formation. a single oral administration of bfmet induced ileal ulcers in specific pathogen-free rats. however, the rats given antibiotics to reduce the intestinal bacteria had no ulcers. bfmet-treated germ-free rats and gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with bifidobacterium adolescentis or lactobacillus acidophilus also had no intestinal ulcers. however, the drug induced ileal ulcers in gnotobiotic rats mono-associated with eubacterium limosum or escherichia coli. an overnight culture of b. adolescentis or l. acidophilus or yogurt containing bifidobacterium breve and streptococcus thermophilus, when given as drinking water, inhibited ulcer formation in the ileum of rats treated with bfmet. gram staining of the ileal contents of normal rats revealed that 97.4% of the stained  microorganisms were gram-positive rods and only 1.2% were gram-negative rods. in  the group of rats with ulcers induced by bfmet, the gram-positive rods decreased  by 56.4% and the gram-negative rods including escherichia coli, klebsiella, proteus and bacteroides increased by 37.3%. however, in the group of rats administered the bifidobacterium culture, the lactobacillus culture or yogurt, the percentages of the gram-negative rods were decreased. although lactobacillus  was a major bacterium in the ileum of normal rats, the gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods e.coli, klebsiella and proteus were increased in the ulcerated ileum of rats treated with bfmet, suggesting that these bacteria are associated with ulcer formation in rats treated with nsaids, and that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium inhibit it by repressing the growth of ulcer-inducing bacteria.

AB  == epidemiological and in vivo and in vitro experimental studies have suggested that fermented milks may interfere with the emergence and/or the development of colon  cancer. the results, however, remain inconclusive. this prompted us to develop a  new approach based on the use of ht-29, a cultured human colon cancer cell line,  to study at the cellular level the effect of fermented milks on colon cancer cell growth and differentiation characteristics. undifferentiated ht-29 cells have been grown in the continuous presence of milks fermented by one of the following  bacterial populations: lactobacillus helveticus, bifidobacterium, l.acidophilus or a mix of streptococcus thermophilus and l. bulgaricus. penicillin g was added  to the cell culture medium, resulting in a complete blockade of bacterial growth  without significant effect on bacterial viability. one out of the four bacteria species studied, namely l.acidophilus, was without effect on both cell growth and differentiation. the three other bacterial strains induced a significant, although variable, reduction in the growth rate of ht-29 cells, which resulted in a 10-50% decrease in the cell number at steady-state (i.e. at cell confluency). the most efficient strains in lowering the ht-29 growth rate were l. helveticus and bifidobacterium. concomitantly, the specific activities of dipeptidyl peptidase iv (dpp iv), a sensitive and specific marker of ht-29 cell differentiation, and that of three other brush border enzymes (sucrase, aminopeptidase n and alkaline phosphatase) were significantly increased, thus suggesting that these cells may have entered a differentiation process. altogether, these results indicate that the use of cultured colon cancer cells may be a useful tool to further study the effect of fermented milks on colon cancer and that bacterial strains may exert a different and specific effect on cancer cell growth and differentiation when used in fermented milk products.

TI  == antigenotoxic properties of lactic acid bacteria in the s. typhimurium mutagenicity assay.
AB  == a high percentage of human tumors is reported to be related to dietary habits. one way to improve the nutritional impact is to increase the intake of protective factors, such as inhibitors of dna damage and other types of anticarcinogens. specific strains of lactic acid bacteria used to ferment milk are promising candidates that may be antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic. we have studied the antimutagenicity of 10 isolated strains of beneficial lactic acid bacteria. four  types of fermented milk products were also studied for their protective properties. the effect of these bacteria on the yield of revertants induced by nitrosated beef extract was investigated in the salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. eight of 10 isolated lactobacillus strains reduced the yield  of his+ revertants almost back to the levels of the untreated controls. different fermented fresh yogurts containing viable bacteria (probably lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus or lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacteria) showed protective effects as well. the degree of  suppressing revertants was independent of the yogurt's fat content. in contrast,  yogurt products that had been heat treated were not inhibitory. the other fresh fermented milk products (e.g., buttermilk, kefir, and "dickmilch") were not antimutagenic in this study. the results imply that some bacteria used in milk processing have an antimutagenic potential and that this property is specific for the bacterial strain.

TI  == strains and species of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milks (yogurts): effect  on in vivo lactose digestion.
AB  == lactose in yogurt with live bacteria is better tolerated than lactose in other dairy foods, partly because of the activity of microbial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal), which digests lactose in vivo. to evaluate the ability of different strains and species of lactic acid bacteria to digest lactose in vivo, yogurts (containing mixtures of strains of streptococcus salivarius subsp thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus) and fermented milks (containing individual species of s thermophilus, l bulgaricus, l acidophilus, or bifidobacterium bifidus) that varied in microbial beta-gal activity were produced. selected products were fed to healthy people who cannot digest lactose, and breath hydrogen production was monitored. all yogurts dramatically and similarly improved lactose digestion, regardless of their total or specific beta-gal activity. the response to fermented milks varied from marginal improvement with b bifidus milk to nearly complete lactose digestion with l bulgaricus milk. the results suggest that total beta-gal was not the limiting factor in promoting lactose digestion, perhaps because of a limited rate of intracellular substrate transport.

AB  == the effect of nonfermented dairy products containing yogurt or acidophilus cultures on lactose utilization by lactose-maldigesting humans was investigated.  yogurt and acidophilus milk containing 10(7) or 10(8) of streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus bulgaricus, or lactobacillus acidophilus, respectively, were prepared using commercially processed 2% low fat milk. immediately following inoculation, products were refrigerated. lactose maldigestion was monitored by measuring breath hydrogen excretion at hourly intervals for 8 h following consumption of 400 ml of each test meal containing approximately 20 g of lactose. the yogurt milk containing 10(8) cfu/ml was shown  to contain significant concentrations of microbial beta-galactosidase (ec 3.2.1.23; approximately 3 u/ml), which remained stable for at least 14 d at refrigerator temperatures. breath hydrogen peaks were delayed and significantly lower (approximately 20 ppm at 5 to 7 h) than control values (approximately 70 ppm at 4 h), and intolerance symptoms were eliminated in all subjects. yogurt milk containing 10(7) cfu/ml demonstrated intermediate breath hydrogen values and was marginally significantly different from control values. lactobacillus acidophilus strains with varying resistance to bile and total beta-galactosidase-producing potential were also tested. only one strain, la-1, which demonstrated low bile resistance and intermediate beta-galactosidase activity, was capable of significantly decreasing breath hydrogen values when 10(8) cfu/ml of milk was consumed.

TI  == effects of lactic acid bacteria and organic acids on growth and germination of bacillus cereus.
AB  == growth and germination of vegetative cells and endospores of bacillus cereus were affected by streptococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus bulgaricus in nonfat milk medium and by salts of organic acids in broth medium. growth of the lactic acid bacteria was not affected by b. cereus. b. cereus increased rapidly to about 10 cfu/ml when cells  were added at the beginning of growth of lactic acid bacteria; it was inactivated slowly when added after 24 h and rapidly when added after 72 h of lactic acid bacterial growth. streptococci were more inhibitory to the growth of b. cereus than lactobacilli were at 24 h. spore germination was not affected after 24 h, but it was inhibited after 48 and 72 h of lactic acid bacterial growth. acetate was more inhibitory to the growth of vegetative cells, while formate was more inhibitory to spore germination. acetate, formate, and lactate (all at 0.1 m) completely inactivated multiplication of b. cereus at ph 6.1, 6.0, and 5.6, respectively. spores of b. cereus were more resistant to these organic acids compared with the resistance of vegetative cells. formate, lactate, and acetate (all at 0.1 m) caused 50% inhibition of spore germination at ph 4.4, 4.3, and 4.2, respectively.

TI  == [adjuvant activity of lactic bacteria: perspectives for its use in oral vaccines].
AB  == the effect of the oral and subcutaneous administration of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus on humoral antibody production and delayed type hypersensitivity response against sheep red blood cells (srbc) was studied. the species of the genus lactobacillus proved to be more effective in both cases, effects being stronger when working with viable bacteria than with non-viable cells. the stimulation of primary cellular and humoral immune responses reached optimal activity with a dose of 6 x 10(9) cells. the plaque-forming cells (pfc) and the circulating antibody titers to the srbc antigen obtained in the groups treated with lactobacilli were 2 to 3 times higher than those of the non-treated control  group. in mice fed with the different lactic acid bacteria circulating antibody against these microorganisms failed to be detected, but when they were administered by subcutaneous route a strong response to antilactic acid bacteria  was stimulated. s. thermophilus was not effective in increasing the immune response. these results suggest that the lactobacilli by oral route, exert a strong adjuvant activity which is responsible for the enhanced host immune responses obtained. in this respect, lactobacilli could be considered as the most promising oral adjuvant.

TI  == adherence of specific yogurt micro-organisms to human peripheral blood lymphocytes.
AB  == yogurt lactic-acid-bacteria (lab) consisting of lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus were evaluated for their capacity to bind to human peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl). these micro-organisms adhere to human t lymphocytes, and bind to b lymphocytes, in high and low frequencies, respectively. in addition, a quantitative analysis of lab binding to pbl was carried out using the same parameters previously applied to a salmonella model. the effect of yogurt lab on the natural anti-bacterial activity exerted by pbl was examined. lymphocyte pretreatment with bacteria did not affect such functions. these findings are discussed in the light of the well known ability of yogurt lab to modulate the immune response.

TI  == enhancement of immune response in mice fed with streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == swiss mice, fed for 8 consecutive d with 50 micrograms/d of viable cultures of lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus thermophilus, showed significant variation in their immune system. in order to study this phenomenon assays for macrophage and lymphocyte function were carried out. both lactic acid bacteria enhanced significantly the enzymatic and phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages as checked against the controls and also accelerated the phagocytic function of the reticuloendothelial system as revealed by the carbon clearance test. on the 2nd d (100 micrograms), l. acidophilus reached a peak of k = .271, which remained high. streptococcus thermophilus was effective only on the 2nd d and then decreased. the lymphocytic activity studied by immunoglobulin secreting  cells was assayed by jerne's method of plaque-forming cells (pfc). this activity  also was increased by the two microorganisms. streptococcus thermophilus proved more effective than l. acidophilus. lactobacillus acidophilus and s. thermophilus activated macrophages and lymphocytes and produced the same increase in the immune response of mice whether administered orally or intraperitoneally.

TI  == survival of lactic acid bacteria in the human stomach and adhesion to intestinal  cells.
AB  == the survival of four strains of lactic acid bacteria in human gastric juice, in vivo and in vitro, and in buffered saline, ph 1 to 5, has been investigated. the  strains studied include two lactobacillus acidophilus strains, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus thermophilus. in addition, the adhesion of these strains to freshly collected human and pig small intestinal cells and to pig large intestinal cells has been studied and the effect of milk on both survival and adhesion tested. as a result of these investigations, an in vitro test system for screening potential cultures for use as human dietary adjuncts can be developed. the ability to survive in gastric juice and to adhere varied significantly for the strains tested; l. acidophilus adh survived and adhered better than the others while s. thermophilus survived and adhered poorly. for all strains, both survival and adhesion was enhanced by milk. as all strains adhered  to some extent to both human and pig intestinal cells, the adhesion mechanism is  probably a nonspecific attachment as opposed to other reported specific lactobacillus adhesion to gastric tissue. from the survival and adhesion data it  seems feasible to obtain elevated levels of viable lactobacillus sp. in human intestine by careful selection of the bacterial strains ingested. furthermore, the in vitro methods used here should be valuable to screen potential strains. the data presented here can then be correlated with human in vivo studies monitoring the beneficial effect of ingestion of these lactobacillus.

TI  == fermentation of aqueous plant seed extracts by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the effects of lactic acid bacterial fermentation on chemical and physical changes in aqueous extracts of cowpea (vigna unguiculata), peanut (arachis hypogea), soybean (glycine max), and sorghum (sorghum vulgare) were studied. the  bacteria investigated were lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus. organisms were inoculated individually into all of the seed extracts; l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus were also evaluated together as inocula for fermenting the legume extracts. during fermentation, bacterial population and changes in titratable acidity, ph, viscosity, and color were measured over a 72-h period at 37 degrees  c. maximum bacterial populations, titratable acidity, ph, and viscosity varied depending upon the type of extract and bacterial strain. the maximum population of each organism was influenced by fermentable carbohydrates, which, in turn, influenced acid production and change in ph. change in viscosity was correlated with the amount of protein and titratable acidity of products. color was affected by pasteurization treatment and fermentation as well as the source of extract. in the extracts inoculated simultaneously with l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, a  synergistic effect resulted in increased bacterial populations, titratable acidity, and viscosity, and decreased ph in all the legume extracts when compared to the extracts fermented with either of these organisms individually. fermented  extracts offer potential as substitutes for cultured dairy products.

TI  == microorganisms and characteristics of laban.
AB  == laban had a titratable acidity of about 1.0%, a ph of 4.25, an ethanol content of 1.25%, and contained 4.2 mug acetaldehyde and 34 mug acetoin/ml. there was no diacetyl. five microorganisms, classified as streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, leuconostoc lactis, kluyveromyces fragilis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae, were responsible for the fermentation. streptococcus thermophilus and l. acidophilus were responsible for acid production with s. thermophilus producing acid more rapidly. most of the acetaldehyde was produced by k. fragilis, little ethanol was found in absence of s. cerevisiae, and the acetoin was producted by s. thermophilus.
