TI  == peripheral blood neutrophil cytokine hyper-reactivity in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == pro-inflammatory cytokine release (il-8, il-6, tnf-alpha, il-1beta) by peripheral blood neutrophils, isolated from periodontitis patients (before/after therapy) and matched controls, was determined after 18 h culture in the presence/absence of escherichia coli lps, opsonised staphylococcus aureus, heat-killed fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. all cultures demonstrated differences in the amounts of each cytokine detected (p < 0.0001), with a clear release pattern (il-8 > il-6 > tnf-alpha = il-1beta). median cytokine release from unstimulated patient neutrophils was consistently, but non-significantly, higher than from control cells. stimulated cytokine release from untreated patient neutrophils was also consistently higher than from control cells. this hyper-reactivity was significant for all tested cytokines when data for all stimuli were combined (p < 0.016). in terms of individual stimuli, significant hyper-reactivity was detected with lps (il-8), f. nucleatum (il-8, tnf-alpha), opsonised s. aureus (il-8, tnf-alpha, il-1beta) and p. gingivalis (il-8, il-1beta). cytokine production by patient neutrophils did not reduce following successful non-surgical periodontal therapy and, except for responses to f. nucleatum, the cytokine hyper-reactivity detected pre-therapy was retained. these data demonstrate that chronic periodontitis is characterised by neutrophils that  constitutively exhibit cytokine hyper-reactivity, the effects of which could modulate local and systemic inflammatory-immune responses and influence the risk  and severity of periodontitis-associated systemic inflammatory diseases.

TI  == extensive identification of bacterial riboflavin transporters and their distribution across bacterial species.
AB  == riboflavin, the precursor for the cofactors flavin mononucleotide (fmn) and flavin adenine dinucleotide, is an essential metabolite in all organisms. while the functions for de novo riboflavin biosynthesis and riboflavin import may coexist in bacteria, the extent of this co-occurrence is undetermined. the ribm,  ribn, rfuabcd and the energy-coupling factor-ribu bacterial riboflavin transporters have been experimentally characterized. in addition, impx, rfnt and  ribxy are proposed as riboflavin transporters based on positional clustering with riboflavin biosynthetic pathway (rbp) genes or conservation of the fmn riboswitch regulatory element. here, we searched for the fmn riboswitch in bacterial genomes to identify genes encoding riboflavin transporters and assessed their distribution among bacteria. two new putative riboflavin transporters were identified: ribz in clostridium and ribv in mesoplasma florum. trans-complementation of an escherichia coli riboflavin auxotroph strain confirmed the riboflavin transport activity of ribz from clostridium difficile, ribxy from chloroflexus aurantiacus, impx from fusobacterium nucleatum and rfnt from ochrobactrum anthropi. the analysis of the genomic distribution of all known bacterial riboflavin transporters revealed that most occur in species possessing  the rbp and that some bacteria may even encode functional riboflavin transporters from two different families. our results indicate that some species possess ancestral riboflavin transporters, while others possess transporters that appear  to have evolved recently. moreover, our data suggest that unidentified riboflavin transporters also exist. the present study doubles the number of experimentally characterized riboflavin transporters and suggests a specific, non-accessory role for these proteins in riboflavin-prototrophic bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == fusobacterium and escherichia: models of colorectal cancer driven by microbiota and the utility of microbiota in colorectal cancer screening.
AB  == intestinal microbiota has emerging roles in the development of colorectal cancer  (crc). intestinal dysbiosis, with altered levels of specific bacteria, is consistently seen in crc. the heart of the debate lies in whether these bacteria  are a cause or consequence of crc. two bacteria in particular, fusobacterium nucleatum and escherichia coli, have consistently been associated with crc. this  review will examine evidence supporting oncogenic roles of f. nucleatum and e. coli. the proposed mechanisms of tumor formation follow two models: bacterial induced chronic inflammation leads to cell proliferation and tumor formation and  virulence factors directly induce tumor formation. this review will further examine the potential for microbiota as biomarkers in crc, with a focus on f. nucleatum.

TI  == antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of pgla-am1, cpf-am1, and magainin-am1: potent activity against oral pathogens.
AB  == cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides are intensively studied classes of host defence peptides (hdps). three peptides, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (pgla-am1), caerulein-precursor fragment (cpf-am1) and magainin-am1, originally isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the african volcano frog xenopus amieti (pipidae), were studied for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities against oral and respiratory pathogens. minimal effective concentrations (mecs), determined by radial diffusion assay, were generally lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) determined by microbroth dilution. pgla-am1 and cpf-am1 were particularly active against streptococcus mutans and all three peptides were effective against fusobacterium  nucleatum, whereas enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans proved to be relatively resistant micro-organisms. a type strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate studied. pgla-am1 displayed the greatest propensity to bind lipopolysaccharide (lps) from escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. all three peptides  showed less binding to p. gingivalis lps than to lps from the other species studied. oral fibroblast viability was unaffected by 50 mum peptide treatments. production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-8 by oral fibroblasts was significantly increased following treatment with 1 or 10 mum magainin-am1 but not following treatment with pgla-am1 or cpf-am1. in conclusion, as well as possessing potent antimicrobial actions, the x. amieti peptides bound to lps from three human pathogens and had no effect on oral fibroblast viability. cpf-am1 and pgla-am1 show promise as templates for the design of novel analogues for the treatment of oral and dental diseases associated with bacteria or fungi.

TI  == diverse allosteric and catalytic functions of tetrameric d-lactate dehydrogenases from three gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == nad-dependent d-lactate dehydrogenases (d-ldhs) reduce pyruvate into d-lactate with oxidation of nadh into nad(+). although non-allosteric d-ldhs from lactobacilli have been extensively studied, the catalytic properties of allosteric d-ldhs from gram-negative bacteria except for escherichia coli remain  unknown. we characterized the catalytic properties of d-ldhs from three gram-negative bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum (fnldh), pseudomonas aeruginosa (paldh), and e. coli (ecldh) to gain an insight into allosteric mechanism of d-ldhs. while paldh and ecldh exhibited narrow substrate specificities toward pyruvate like usual d-ldhs, fnldh exhibited a broad substrate specificity toward  hydrophobic 2-ketoacids such as 2-ketobutyrate and 2-ketovalerate, the former of  which gave a 2-fold higher k cat/s0.5 value than pyruvate. whereas the three enzymes consistently showed hyperbolic shaped pyruvate saturation curves below ph 6.5, fnldh and ecldh, and paldh showed marked positive and negative cooperativity, respectively, in the pyruvate saturation curves above ph 7.5. oxamate inhibited the catalytic reactions of fnldh competitively with pyruvate, and the paldh reaction in a mixed manner at ph 7.0, but markedly enhanced the reactions of the two enzymes at low concentration through canceling of the apparent homotropic cooperativity at ph 8.0, although it constantly inhibited the ecldh reaction. fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and certain divalent metal ions such as mg(2+) also markedly enhanced the reactions of fnldh and paldh, but none of them  enhanced the reaction of ecldh. thus, our study demonstrates that bacterial d-ldhs have highly divergent allosteric and catalytic properties.

TI  == fusobacterium and enterobacteriaceae: important players for crc?
AB  == the gut microbiota plays an essential role in regulating intestinal homeostasis through its capacity to modulate various biological activities ranging from barrier, immunity and metabolic function. not surprisingly, microbial dysbiosis is associated with numerous intestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd) and colorectal cancer (crc). in this piece, we will review recent  evidence that gut microbial dysbiosis can influence intestinal disease, including colitis and crc. we will discuss the biological events implicated in the development of microbial dysbiosis and the emergence of crc-associated microorganisms, focusing on escherichia coli and fusobacterium nucleatum. finally, the mechanisms by which e. coli and f. nucleatum exert potentially carcinogenic effects on the host will be reviewed.

TI  == dna-based adaptive immunity protect host from infection-associated periodontal bone resorption via recognition of porphyromonas gingivalis virulence component.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) is one of a constellation of oral organisms associated with human chronic periodontitis. while adaptive immunity to periodontal pathogen proteins has been investigated and is an important component of periodontal bone resorption, the effect of periodontal pathogen dna in eliciting systemic and mucosal antibody and modulating immune responses has not been investigated. methods: rowett rats were locally injected with whole genomic  pg dna in alum. escherichia coli (ec) genomic dna, fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) genomic dna, and saline/alum injected rats served as controls. after various time points, serum igg and salivary iga antibody to ec, fn or pg were detected by elisa. serum and salivary antibody reactions with pg surface antigens were determined by western blot analyses and the specific antigen was identified by mass spectrometry. effects of genomic dna immunization on pg bacterial colonization and experimental periodontal bone resorption were also evaluated. results: sera from pg dna, ec dna and fn dna-injected rats did not react with ec  or fn bacteria. serum igg antibody levels to pg and pg surface extracts were significantly higher in animals immunized with pg dna as compared to the control  groups. rats injected with pg dna demonstrated a strong serum igg and salivary iga antibody reaction solely to pg fimbrillin (41kda), the major protein component of pg fimbriae. in the pg dna-immunized group, the numbers of pg bacteria in oral cavity and the extent of periodontal bone resorption were significantly reduced after pg infection. conclusions: this study suggests that infected hosts may select specific genes from whole genomic dna of the periodontal pathogen for transcription and presentation. the results indicate that the unique gene selected can initiate a host protective immune response to the parent bacterium.

TI  == preliminary molecular analysis of bacterial composition in periapical lesions with primary endodontic infections of deciduous teeth.
AB  == background: the bacterial composition of periapical lesions in deciduous teeth has not been well documented. this study was designed to explore the bacterial compositions, especially the dominant bacteria in periapical lesions using 16s rrna sequencing. methods: tissue samples were collected from 11 periapical lesions in deciduous teeth with primary endodontic infections. dna was extracted  from each sample and analyzed using 16s rrna cloning and sequencing for the identification of bacteria. results: all dna samples were positive for 16s rrna gene pcr. one hundred and fifty-one phylotypes from 810 clones were identified to eight phyla, and each sample contained an average of 25.9 phylotypes. in addition, 59 phylotypes were detected in more than two samples, and fusobacterium (f.) nucleatum (8/11), dialister (d.) invisus (8/11), campylobacter (c.) gracilis (7/11), escherichia (e.) coli dh1 (6/11), aggregatibacter (a.) segnis (6/11), and streptococcus (s.) mitis (6/11) were the most prevalent species. furthermore, 45  as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes were also identified. conclusions: chronic periapical lesions in deciduous teeth contained polymicrobial infections. f. nucleatum, d. invisus, c. gracilis, e. coli dh1, a. segnis, and s. mitis were the most prevalent species detected by 16s rrna sequencing.

TI  == oxygen deprivation affects the antimicrobial action of ll-37 as determined by microplate real-time kinetic measurements under anaerobic conditions.
AB  == some agents, including escherichia coli and group a streptococcus pyogenes cause  infections in oxygen depleted sites. ll-37 is a human host defence peptide shown  previously to play an important role in controlling infections caused by these bacteria. however, the effect of oxygen levels on the antimicrobial activity of ll-37 remains obscure. in order to test the effect of oxygen (or lack thereof) on ll-37's activity against e. coli and s. pyogenes, a method for adapting commonly  used microtiter plates for real-time growth-kinetic (and growth-inhibition) measurements under anaerobic conditions was developed. using the proposed method, anaerobic conditions were attained in the microplate within 30 min and were maintained for at least five days. anaerobiosis was further confirmed by comparing the growth of two anaerobic oral species (porphyromonas gingivalis and  fusobacterium nucleatum) in anaerobic compartments of microtiter plates versus aerobic ones. both species grew only in the anaerobic compartments of the plates  as indicated by the growth curves generated. the sensitivities of e. coli and s.  pyogenes to ll-37 were tested under anaerobic conditions and compared to those in aerobic ones. the oxygen facultative e. coli grew to a higher density under aerobic conditions and its sensitivity to ll-37 was increased under anaerobiosis. the microaerophilic pathogen s. pyogenes grew faster and to a higher density under anaerobic conditions and was much more resistant to ll-37 under oxygen deprivation. our results suggest that resistance to antimicrobial agents of microbes infecting anaerobic-microaerophilic sites should be tested under oxygen-restricted conditions.

TI  == the lipid bilayer-inserted membrane protein bama of escherichia coli facilitates  insertion and folding of outer membrane protein a from its complex with skp.
AB  == folding of beta-barrel membrane proteins, either from a urea-unfolded form or from chaperone-bound aqueous forms, has been characterized for pure lipid bilayers. the impact of preinserted integral proteins from biomembranes has not been examined in biophysical comparisons, but this knowledge is important for the characterization of protein assembly machinery in membranes to distinguish specific effects from unspecific effects. here, folding was studied for a beta-barrel membrane protein, outer membrane protein a (ompa) from escherichia coli, in the absence and presence of two other preinserted integral proteins, bama of the beta-barrel assembly machinery complex (bam) from e. coli and foma from fusobacterium nucleatum. three different preformed lipid membranes of phosphatidylcholine were prepared to compare the folding kinetics of ompa, namely, proteoliposomes containing either bama or foma and pure liposomes. urea-unfolded ompa folded faster into phosphatidylcholine bilayers containing foma than into pure lipid bilayers, but the kinetics of ompa folding and insertion were fastest for bilayers containing bama. incorporation of bama into lipid bilayers composed of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine greatly weakened the inhibiting effect of phosphatidylethanolamine on the folding of ompa. folding of ompa from its complex with the periplasmic chaperone skp into bilayers composed of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine was inhibited in the absence of bama but facilitated when bama was present, indicating an interaction of skp-ompa complexes with bama.

TI  == comparative microbial analysis of paired amniotic fluid and cord blood from pregnancies complicated by preterm birth and early-onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == background: 16s rrna-based genomic analyses have revolutionized our understanding of infectious diseases. many cases which were recognized as "idiopathic" are now  known to have an infectious etiology. here, we present a proof-of-concept study to examine the microbial link between intra-amniotic infection (iai) and early-onset neonatal sepsis (eons). results: using culture independent methods, we analyzed paired amniotic fluid (af) and cord blood (cb) samples from 36 singleton pregnancies complicated by preterm birth (ptb), iai, and/or eons. ptb cases were grouped as 1) group 1- neonatal blood culture-positive eons (n=6). 2)  group 2- neonatal blood culture-negative presumed eons with positive iai (n=16).  3) group 3- neonatal blood culture-negative presumed eons with no iai (n=7); 4) group 4- no eons or iai (n=7). in addition, samples from term healthy deliveries  (n=8) served as technical controls. a total of 31 species (15 non-redundant) were identified in af, of which only 1/3 were cultivated. significantly fewer microorganisms were detected in cb, with a total of 18 species (7 non-redundant)  identified, of which only 2 (escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae) were cultivated. of those, bergeyella, fusobacterium nucleatum, and sneathia sanguinegens had not been detected in eons before. the novel species identified in af by pcr include peptoniphilus harei and lachnospiraceae sp. the majority (72%) of cb species were also detected in the matching af, with e. coli and f. nucleatum as the most prevalent. the 16s rrna sequences of paired af and cb were  99.9-100% identical, while no identical sequences were found between different pregnancies. conclusions: previously unrecognized, uncultivated or difficult-to-cultivate species are implicated in eons. microbial species in paired af and cb likely share the same infectious origin. given its prevalence in eons, f. nucleatum should be placed on the same importance scale as e. coli.

TI  == folding and stability of outer membrane protein a (ompa) from escherichia coli in an amphipathic polymer, amphipol a8-35.
AB  == amphipols are a class of amphipathic polymers designed to maintain membrane proteins in aqueous solutions in the absence of detergents. denatured beta-barrel membrane proteins, like outer membrane proteins ompa from escherichia coli and foma from fusobacterium nucleatum, can be folded by dilution of the denaturant urea in the presence of amphipol a8-35. here, the folding kinetics and stability  of ompa in a8-35 have been investigated. folding is well described by two parallel first-order processes, whose half-times, ~5 and ~70 min, respectively, are independent of a8-35 concentration. the faster process contributed ~55-64 % to ompa folding. folding into a8-35 was faster than into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers and complete at ratios as low as ~0.17 g/g a8-35/ompa, corresponding to ~1-2 a8-35 molecules per ompa. activation energies were determined from the temperature dependence of folding kinetics, monitored both by electrophoresis, which reports on the formation of stable ompa tertiary structure, and by fluorescence spectroscopy, which reflects changes in the environment of tryptophan side chains. the two methods yielded consistent estimates, namely ~5-9 kj/mol for the fast process and ~29-37 kj/mol for the slow one, which is lower than is observed for ompa folding into dioleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers. folding and unfolding titrations with urea  demonstrated that ompa folding into a8-35 is reversible and that amphipol-refolded ompa is thermodynamically stable at room temperature. comparison of activation energies for folding and unfolding in a8-35 versus detergent indicates that stabilization of a8-35-trapped ompa against denaturation by urea is a kinetic, not a thermodynamic phenomenon.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis mediates inflammasome repression in polymicrobial cultures through a novel mechanism involving reduced endocytosis.
AB  == the interleukin (il)-1beta-processing inflammasome has recently been identified as a target for pathogenic evasion of the inflammatory response by a number of bacteria and viruses. we postulated that the periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas  gingivalis may suppress the inflammasome as a mechanism for its low immunogenicity and pathogenic synergy with other, more highly immunogenic periodontal bacteria. our results show that p. gingivalis lacks signaling capability for the activation of the inflammasome in mouse macrophages. furthermore, p. gingivalis can suppress inflammasome activation by another periodontal bacterium, fusobacterium nucleatum. this repression affects il-1beta  processing, as well as other inflammasome-mediated processes, including il-18 processing and cell death, in both human and mouse macrophages. f. nucleatum activates il-1beta processing through the nlrp3 inflammasome; however, p. gingivalis repression is not mediated through reduced levels of inflammasome components. p. gingivalis can repress nlrp3 inflammasome activation by escherichia coli, and by danger-associated molecular patterns and pattern-associated molecular patterns that mediate activation through endocytosis. however, p. gingivalis does not suppress nlrp3 inflammasome activation by atp or nigericin. this suggests that p. gingivalis may preferentially suppress endocytic pathways toward inflammasome activation. to directly test whether p. gingivalis infection affects endocytosis, we assessed the uptake of fluorescent particles in the presence or absence of p. gingivalis.  our results show that p. gingivalis limits both the number of cells taking up beads and the number of beads taken up for bead-positive cells. these results provide a novel mechanism of pathogen-mediated inflammasome inhibition through the suppression of endocytosis.

TI  == neutrophil superoxide production in the presence of cigarette smoke extract, nicotine and cotinine.
AB  == aim: to determine the effect of cigarette smoke extract, nicotine and cotinine on lucigenin-detectable neutrophil superoxide production. materials & methods: neutrophils from periodontally healthy individuals were treated with aqueous smoke extract, nicotine and cotinine, prior to stimulation or at the same time as stimulation with fusobacterium nucleatum, igg-opsonized staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps). superoxide generation was determined by lucigenin chemiluminescence. results: smoke extract induced superoxide release from neutrophils (p <0.0001) in a dose-dependent manner. by contrast, superoxide  generation by neutrophils in response to pathologically relevant stimuli was inhibited by pre-treatment with smoke extract (p <0.01). this inhibition did not  require the continued presence of the extract. a similar reduction in stimulated  superoxide production by smoke extract was detected when neutrophils were simultaneously exposed to the extract and stimuli. nicotine and cotinine (0-10 mug/ml) had no effect on superoxide release from unstimulated or stimulated neutrophils. conclusions: stable water-soluble components of cigarette smoke directly induce superoxide generation by otherwise unstimulated neutrophils, but  reduce superoxide responses of cells to pathologically relevant stimuli. these data suggest potential neutrophil-mediated mechanisms by which smoking may initiate and maintain oxidative stress at periodontally healthy sites and participate in disease progression, by reducing innate immune responses.

TI  == specificity of antimicrobial peptide ll-37 to neutralize periodontopathogenic lipopolysaccharide activity in human oral fibroblasts.
AB  == background: the antimicrobial peptide ll-37 is known to have a potent lipopolysaccharide (lps)-neutralizing activity in various cell types. because of  observed heterogeneity within periodontopathogenic lps, the authors hypothesized  that ll-37 had specificity to neutralize such lps activity. the present study, therefore, aims to investigate the lps-neutralizing activity of ll-37 to various  periodontopathogenic lps in interleukin-8 (il-8) production after challenging them in human oral fibroblasts. methods: human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (pdlf) and gingival fibroblasts (gf) were cultured from biopsies of periodontal ligament and gingival tissues. after cell confluence in 24-well plates, lps (10 mug/ml) from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were added with or without ll-37 (10 mug/ml). after 18 hours, the supernatant was collected and analyzed in  il-8 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: all periodontopathogenic lps statistically significantly induced il-8 production in both pdlf and gf (p <0.01). after neutralization with ll-37, both pdlf and gf showed a statistically significant reduction in il-8 production compared with lps-treated groups without ll-37 (p <0.01), and the percentage of reduction in il-8 production in pdlf appeared to be higher than in gf. in addition, the percentage of reduction in il-8 production varied considerably according to each  periodontopathogenic lps. conclusions: the antimicrobial peptide ll-37 had an ability to suppress periodontopathogenic lps-induced il-8 production in both pdlf and gf. its lps-neutralizing activity revealed specificity to periodontopathogenic lps and seemed to be dependent on the heterogeneity within lps between different genera.

TI  == antibacterial activity of sphingoid bases and fatty acids against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == there is growing evidence that the role of lipids in innate immunity is more important than previously realized. how lipids interact with bacteria to achieve  a level of protection, however, is still poorly understood. to begin to address the mechanisms of antibacterial activity, we determined mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of lipids common to the skin and oral cavity--the sphingoid bases d-sphingosine, phytosphingosine, and dihydrosphingosine and the fatty acids sapienic acid and lauric acid--against four gram-negative bacteria and seven gram-positive bacteria. exact kruskal-wallis tests of these values showed differences among lipid treatments (p < 0.0001) for each bacterial species except serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa. d-sphingosine (mbc range, 0.3 to 19.6 mug/ml), dihydrosphingosine (mbc range, 0.6 to 39.1 mug/ml), and phytosphingosine (mbc range, 3.3 to 62.5 mug/ml) were active against all bacteria except s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). sapienic acid (mbc range, 31.3 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and fusobacterium nucleatum but not active against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa, corynebacterium bovis, corynebacterium striatum, and corynebacterium  jeikeium (mbc > 500 mug/ml). lauric acid (mbc range, 6.8 to 375.0 mug/ml) was active against all bacteria except e. coli, s. marcescens, and p. aeruginosa (mbc > 500 mug/ml). complete killing was achieved as early as 0.5 h for some lipids but took as long as 24 h for others. hence, sphingoid bases and fatty acids have  different antibacterial activities and may have potential for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention in infection.

TI  == community-based interference against integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
AB  == as part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. less emphasis has been  given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. in this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. when co-cultivated in saliva medium, p. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. more interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent p. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as p. aeruginosa.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum adhesin fada binds vascular endothelial cadherin and alters endothelial integrity.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative oral anaerobe, capable of systemic dissemination causing infections and abscesses, often in mixed-species, at different body sites. we have shown previously that f. nucleatum adheres to and invades host epithelial and endothelial cells via a novel fada adhesin. in this study, vascular endothelial (ve)-cadherin, a member of the cadherin family and a  cell-cell junction molecule, was identified as the endothelial receptor for fada, required for f. nucleatum binding to the cells. fada colocalized with ve-cadherin on endothelial cells, causing relocation of ve-cadherin away from the cell-cell junctions. as a result, the endothelial permeability was increased, allowing the  bacteria to cross the endothelium through loosened junctions. this crossing mechanism may explain why the organism is able to disseminate systemically to colonize in different body sites and even overcome the placental and blood-brain  barriers. co-incubation of f. nucleatum and escherichia coli enhanced penetration of the endothelial cells by the latter in the transwell assays, suggesting f. nucleatum may serve as an 'enabler' for other microorganisms to spread systemically. this may explain why f. nucleatum is often found in mixed infections. this study reveals a possible novel dissemination mechanism utilized  by pathogens.

TI  == participation of strictly anerobic bacteria in infections among hospitalized transplant patients in a clinical hospital in warsaw.
AB  == background: many strictly anerobic bacteria are a part of the human commensal microflora. especially multitudinously they inhabit the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory, and genital tracts. infections with these bacteria may occur after escape of the bacteria from their natural habitat. there are often mixed anerobic and aerobic infections. after rupture of the gastrointestinal tract or surgery, the organisms can cause significant pathology  including abscesses and bacteremia. objective: the aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of gram-negative strictly anerobic bacteria isolated from different samples collected from patients on transplant wards. materials and methods: samples from patients with suspected infections. underwent isolation and identification of microorganisms under anerobic conditions using standard laboratory methods. results: gram-negative rods were observed in 46% of clinical  samples, most frequently bacteroides genus as well as fusobacterium necrophorum/f.nucleatum and f.mortiferum (14%). most species of the genus bacteroides were accompanied by escherichia coli, less frequently with other aerobic gram-negative rods or gram-positive cocci. conclusion: gram-negative bacteria were frequently isolated in the samples. because they are the part of the normal flora, this observation indicated the endogenous nature of infections  resulting from bacterial translocation out of their natural habitat.

AB  == a third enzyme that produces hydrogen sulfide from l-cysteine was identified in fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum. the fn1055 gene was cloned from a cosmid library constructed with genomic dna of f. nucleatum atcc 25586. despite the database annotation that the product of fn1055 is a cysteine synthase, reverse-phase hplc revealed that no l-cysteine was produced in vitro by the purified fn1055 protein; however, the enzyme did produce l-serine. in addition, a cysteine auxotroph, escherichia coli nk3, transformed with a plasmid containing the fn1055 gene did not grow without cysteine, which further suggests that fn1055 does not function as a cysteine synthase. the michaelis-menten kinetics (k(m) =0.09 +/- 0.001 mm and k(cat) =5.43 +/- 0.64 s(-1)) of the purified enzyme showed that the capacity of fn1055 to produce hydrogen sulfide was between that of two other enzymes, fn0625 and fn1220. incubation of fn1055 with l-cysteine resulted in the production of hydrogen sulfide, but not of pyruvate, ammonia or lanthionine, which are all byproducts produced in addition to hydrogen sulfide when fn0625 or fn1220 is incubated with l-cysteine. instead, fn1055 produced l-serine in its reaction with l-cysteine. fn1055 produces hydrogen sulfide from l-cysteine by a mechanism that is different from that of fn0625 or fn1220.

TI  == evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  == in this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: m40 transystem, amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both copan diagnostics, corona, ca, usa), and ssi transportmedium (statens serum institut, copenhagen denmark). the clsi m40-a standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. the transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. after 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all  organisms tested. ssi transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. in polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. at 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. the species most difficult to recover  in all the three systems was neisseria gonorrhoeae. when selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions  that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.

TI  == effect of nicotine, cotinine and cigarette smoke extract on the neutrophil respiratory burst.
AB  == aims: to determine the effect of nicotine, cotinine and cigarette smoke extract (cse) on the neutrophil respiratory burst and their effect on activation of the nuclear factor-kappab (nfkappab) pathway in oral epithelium. materials and methods: neutrophils from periodontally healthy individuals were treated with nicotine, cotinine and cse before stimulation with fusobacterium nucleatum, igg-opsonized staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. total and extracellular reactive oxygen species (ros) generation was determined by luminol/isoluminol chemiluminescence. activation of nfkappab in oral epithelial cells was determined by immunocytochemistry. results: smoke extract alone caused increased neutrophil extracellular isoluminol-dependent chemiluminescence, not detectable with luminol. however, pre-treatment with smoke extract reduced both total and extracellular ros generation in response to all stimuli. nicotine and cotinine had no effect on the neutrophil respiratory burst. smoke extract, nicotine and cotinine did not induce oral epithelial cell nfkappab activation. conclusions: these data demonstrate that smoke extract reduces the ability of neutrophils to generate ros after stimulation with f. nucleatum and igg-opsonized s. aureus but, at high concentrations, stimulates extracellular ros generation. during periodontitis, cigarette smoking may differentially affect neutrophil function, generally preventing elimination of periodontal pathogens but, in heavy smokers, also stimulating ros release and oxidative stress mediated tissue damage.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum-associated beta-defensin inducer (fad-i): identification, isolation, and functional evaluation.
AB  == human beta-defensins (hbds) are small, cationic antimicrobial peptides, secreted  by mucosal epithelial cells that regulate adaptive immune functions. we previously reported that fusobacterium nucleatum, a ubiquitous gram-negative bacterium of the human oral cavity, induces human beta-defensin 2 (hbd2) upon contact with primary oral epithelial cells. we now report the isolation and characterization of an f. nucleatum (atcc 25586)-associated defensin inducer (fad-i). biochemical approaches revealed a cell wall fraction containing four proteins that stimulated the production of hbd2 in human oral epithelial cells (hoecs). cross-referencing of the n-terminal sequences of these proteins with the f. nucleatum genome revealed that the genes encoding the proteins were fada, fn1527, fn1529, and fn1792. quantitative pcr of hoec monolayers challenged with escherichia coli clones expressing the respective cell wall proteins revealed that fn1527 was most active in the induction of hbd2 and hence was termed fad-i.  we tagged fn1527 with a c-myc epitope on the c-terminal end to identify and purify it from the e. coli clone. purified fn1527 (fad-i) induced hbd2 mrna and protein expression in hoec monolayers. f. nucleatum cell wall and fad-i induced hbd2 via tlr2. porphorymonas gingivalis, an oral pathogen that does not induce hbd2 in hoecs, was able to significantly induce expression of hbd2 in hoecs only  when transformed to express fad-i. fad-i or its derivates offer a potentially new paradigm in immunoregulatory therapeutics because they may one day be used to bolster the innate defenses of vulnerable mucosae.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum regulation of neutrophil transcription.
AB  == background and objective: abnormal neutrophil responses have been observed in periodontitis patients, including hyper-reactivity in terms of production of reactive oxygen species (ros) following exposure to the key quorum-sensing plaque bacterium, fusobacterium nucleatum. this study was designed to characterize the transcriptional response of neutrophils to f. nucleatum. material and methods: peripheral blood neutrophils were exposed to f. nucleatum, and gene expression was analysed using high-throughput transcriptomics. results: microarray technology demonstrated differential expression of 208 genes (163 increased and 43 decreased relative to control genes), which identified regulation of several ontological classes, including signal transduction (13%), transcription regulation (7%) and ros response (14%). individual gene expression analysis of selected transcripts, including csf, cxcl3, fos, hmox1, hsp40, sod2, nfkb2 and gp91, in individual and pooled rna samples from control and f. nucleatum-exposed  neutrophils corroborated microarray data. analysis of ros generation, combined with transcript analysis, in response to a panel of proinflammatory stimuli (f. nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide and opsonized staphylococcus aureus) identified significant differences in ros and transcript regulatory control. further analyses of neutrophils from periodontitis patients and periodontally healthy control subjects stimulated with f. nucleatum  indicated significant differential induction of several ros response-related transcripts. conclusion: these data demonstrate that neutrophils are transcriptionally active in response to the periodontal pathogen f. nucleatum and that these changes in gene expression are likely to affect neutrophil function. the differential response of neutrophils to a range of stimuli combined with data demonstrating differences between patient and control neutrophils indicate the importance of this cell and its interaction with the local tissue environment in  the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == [identification of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens and determination of antibiotic susceptibilities].
AB  == routine isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria present several difficulties leading to defects in the determination of  local susceptibility patterns which will guide empirical treatment protocols. this study was carried out to identify the anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical materials obtained from the suspected patients with anaerobic infection and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities against several antibiotics. one hundred clinical specimens (36 blood, 31 abscess, 12 peritoneal  fluid, 7 joint fluid, 7 pleural fluid, 3 biopsies, 3 cerebrospinal fluids and 1 surgical wound) that were examined in our laboratory during march 20-october 30 2007, were included in the study. the specimens were collected and transported under anaerobic conditions and inoculated to conventional aerobic media and to wilkins chalgren agar, schaedler agar and chopped-meat broth for anaerobic isolation. isolated anaerobic bacteria were identified with api 20a panels (bio-merieux, france) via conventional methods and by the help of an-ident discs  (oxoid, england). penicillin g, clindamycin, cefoxitin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem susceptibility tests were performed with e-  test method. twenty two anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 14 clinical specimens; 7 of the specimens yielding the growth of more than one type of anaerobic bacteria and 8 specimens yielding both anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial (4 escherichia coli and 4 enterococcus spp.) growth. anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 89 abscess and in 6 peritoneal fluid specimens. the distribution of the anaerobic bacteria identified among these specimens were as follows: bacteroides fragilis (n = 6), bacteroides spp. other than b.fragilis (n = 4), clostridium spp. (n = 2), fusobacterium necrophorum/nucleatum (n = 1), prevotella intermedia/disiens (n = 1), peptococcus niger (n = 2), peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 5), and lactobacillus acidophilus/lenseii (n = 1). beta-lactamase activity was detected only in 2 of the 6 b. fragilis isolates. all of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem and  piperacillin/tazobactam. the highest rate of resistance was detected against penicillin g (9/22; 41%). while anaerobic gram-positive cocci (n = 7) were found  to be sensitive to all antibiotics, the rate of resistance among anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were 75% (9/12) to penicillin, 33.3% (4/12) to clindamycin, 8.3% (1/12) to metronidazole. among anaerobic gram-positive bacilli (n = 3), 2 were resistant to metronidazole, one to clindamycin and one to cefoxitin. the results of this first anaerobic antimicrobial susceptibility testing study performed at konya area in turkey revealed that penicillin was not appropriate in empirical treatment of anaerobic infections, clindamycin susceptibility should be tested before use, metronidazole and cefoxitin could be used in empirical treatment and imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam should be saved for the treatment of complicated infections and infections caused by resistant bacteria.

TI  == production of indole from l-tryptophan and effects of these compounds on biofilm  formation by fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586.
AB  == the l-tryptophan degradation product indole is a purported extracellular signaling molecule that influences biofilm formation in various bacteria. here we analyzed the mechanisms of indole production in fusobacterium nucleatum and the effects of tryptophan and indole on f. nucleatum planktonic and biofilm cells. the amino acid sequence deduced from the fn1943 gene in f. nucleatum atcc 25586 was 28% identical to that deduced from tnaa in escherichia coli, which encodes tryptophanase catalyzing the beta-elimination of l-tryptophan to produce indole.  the fn1943 gene was cotranscribed with the downstream gene fn1944, which is a homolog of tnab encoding low-affinity tryptophan permease. the transcript started at position -68 or -153 from the first nucleotide of the fn1943 translation initiation codon. real-time quantitative pcr showed that much more f. nucleatum fn1943 transcripts were obtained from log-phase cells than from stationary-phase  cells. indole production by the purified recombinant protein encoded by fn1943 was examined using high-performance liquid chromatography. the k(m) and k(cat) of the enzyme were 0.26 +/- 0.03 mm and 0.74 +/- 0.04 s(-1), respectively. f. nucleatum biofilm formation and the biofilm supernatant concentration of indole increased dose dependently with increasing tryptophan concentrations. exogenous indole also increased f. nucleatum biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner.  even at very high concentrations, tryptophan did not affect fn1943 expression, whereas similar indole concentrations decreased expression. thus, exogenous tryptophan and indole were suggested to increase f. nucleatum biofilms.

TI  == communication: antimicrobial activity of smap28 with a targeting domain for porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == antibiotic therapy is often used with mechanical therapy to treat periodontal disease. however, complications associated with antibiotic use can occur. a 'bacteria-specific' targeted approach would eliminate some of these complications and kill specific periodontopathogens without harming the commensal bacteria. one such approach is to couple antimicrobial peptides to a ligand, pheromone, or antibody specific for the periodontopathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis. to assess the feasibility of this approach, we attached pqgppq, a peptide from proline-rich protein 1 to either the n-terminus of smap28 (peptide zs37-37) or the c-terminus  of smap28 (peptide zs37-38) to see whether it has potential as a carrier ligand to deliver smap28 to the surface of p. gingivalis. for escherichia coli and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, the median minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of zs37-37 was higher than the median of smap28 alone, although the median mic of zs37-38 was lower than that of smap28 alone. for p. gingivalis, there was no difference in the median mic values. for s. aureus, the  median mic was higher for zs37-37 and zs37-38 compared to smap28 alone, particularly for zs37-38. for fusobacterium nucleatum, the median mic values were equal for zs37-37 and zs37-38 and higher than the median mic for smap28 alone. attaching pqgppq to smap28 did not greatly increase the antimicrobial activity of zs37-37 or zs37-38 for p. gingivalis nor substantially decrease the antimicrobial activity of zs37-37 or zs37-38 for the four other microorganisms tested. this is  an initial step to develop a selective antimicrobial agent that has 'targeted' antimicrobial activity without adverse reactions often associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

TI  == innate inflammatory responses of human decidual cells to periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontopathic bacteria exert potent proinflammatory effects in human decidua.  study design: the immunostimulatory effects of gram-positive and negative periodontopathic bacteria and their lipopolysaccharides were tested in human decidual cell cultures in comparison with escherichia coli. cytokine production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; inflammatory gene expression was measured by oligonucleotide arrays and quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction. results: all bacteria that were tested elicited an inflammatory response, although concentration-dependence and efficacy varied considerably with organism and culture. lipopolysaccharides were more potent stimuli than intact bacterial cells, although bacteria exerted greater effects at high concentrations. of 112 genes on the arrays, 18 genes were stimulated significantly by one or more lipopolysaccharide preparation. conclusion: the ability of periodontopathic bacteria to stimulate a decidual inflammatory response is highly variable and partly dependent on the presence and structure of constituent lipopolysaccharides. this adds to our understanding of the causal association between periodontal disease and preterm birth.

AB  == background: direct microscopy, anaerobic culture and dna-dna hybridization have previously demonstrated an association between microorganisms and osteoradionecrosis (orn). the purpose of our study was to use culture independent molecular techniques to detect bacteria in necrotic bone lesions of the mandible  after radiation therapy. design: bacterial dna was extracted from eight deep medullar specimens from resected mandibles (six cases), including one patient with relapse. 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified, cloned, transformed into escherichia coli and sequenced to determine species identity and closest relatives. results: from the analysis of 438 clones, 59 predominant species were  detected, 27% of which have not been cultivated. the predominant species detected from radionecrotic mandibles were campylobacter gracilis, streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone fg014, uncultured bacterium clone  rl178, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella spp. the study demonstrated intersubject variability of the bacteria present in orn. in contrast to the diverse bacterial profile detected in primary infection, only a few members of the oral indigenous flora were identified from the relapse case. conclusions: diverse bacterial profiles in specimens of orn in marrow spaces of the mandible were detected by culture independent molecular techniques. to better understand the pathogenesis and to improve the therapy of the infection, detection of all members of the complex bacterial flora associated with orn is necessary.

TI  == methamphetamine cytotoxicity and effect on lps-stimulated il-1beta production by  human monocytes.
AB  == methamphetamine (meth) abuse is associated with "meth mouth", characterized by rampant dental decay and destruction of periodontal bone and soft tissues. in periodontitis, monocyte/macrophages, stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps), produce interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), contributing to bone and soft tissue degradation. effects of meth on monocyte/macrophages and its role in periodontitis are unknown. the objective of this study was to determine meth cytotoxicity and effects on constitutive and lps-stimulated il-1beta production in thp-1 human monocytes. meth significantly reduced cell viability, assessed by  activity of a mitochondrial enzyme, by 20-40% after 24h, with recovery at longer  periods. brief exposure to meth caused <10% cytotoxicity (measured by an assay that detects membrane damage). lps from e. coli or the periodontopathogen fusobacterium nucleatum (f. n.) significantly increased il-1beta production (measured by elisa). despite cytotoxicity of some meth concentrations, meth had no significant effect on constitutive il-1beta production. however, meth generally increased lps-stimulated il-1beta levels, reaching statistical significance at 5x10(-5)m meth ( approximately 50% to >100% increase). the study  suggests that meth potentiation of periodontopathogen lps stimulation of il-1beta in monocytes could contribute to periodontitis in meth abusers, consistent with other studies suggesting a role for increased il-1beta in deleterious effects of  meth.

TI  == protein-lipid interactions with fusobacterium nucleatum major outer membrane protein foma: spin-label epr and polarized infrared spectroscopy.
AB  == foma, the major outer membrane protein of fusobacterium nucleatum, was expressed  and purified in escherichia coli and reconstituted from detergent in bilayer membranes of phosphatidylcholines with chain lengths from c(12:0) to c(17:0). the conformation and orientation of membrane-incorporated foma were determined from polarized, attenuated total reflection, infrared (ir) spectroscopy, and lipid-protein interactions with foma were characterized by using electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) spectroscopy of spin-labeled lipids. approximately 190 residues of membranous foma are estimated to be in a beta-sheet configuration from ir band fitting, which is consistent with a 14-strand transmembrane beta-barrel structure. ir dichroism of foma indicates that the beta-strands are tilted by approximately 45 degrees relative to the sheet/barrel axis and that the order parameter of the latter displays a discontinuity corresponding to hydrophobic matching with fluid c(13:0) lipid chains. the stoichiometry ( n b = 23 lipids/monomer) of lipid-protein interaction from epr demonstrates that foma is not trimeric in membranes of dic(14:0) phosphatidylcholine and is consistent with a monomeric beta-barrel of 14-16 strands. the pronounced selectivity of interaction found with anionic spin-labeled lipids places basic residues of the protein in the vicinity of the polar-apolar membrane interfaces, consistent with  current topology models. comparison with similar data from the 8- to 22-stranded  e. coli outer membrane proteins, ompa, ompg, and fhua, supports the above conclusions.

AB  == background and objective: host responses following the recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide can range from acute inflammation to septic shock. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the ability of the ksl-w decapeptide to bind to and block the endotoxic effects of lipopolysaccharide. material and methods: an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based binding assay using fluorescently labeled ksl-w to detect adsorbed escherichia coli o55:b5 lipopolysaccharide was employed. a commercially available recombinant factor c lipopolysaccharide detection assay, hemagglutination of rabbit erythrocytes as well as e-selectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used to assess the anti-endotoxic effects after ksl-w exposure to e. coli lipopolysaccharide as well as to oral lipopolysaccharide samples. results: lipopolysaccharide-binding assays using e. coli o55:b5 lipopolysaccharide revealed both a higher maximal binding range (532-713 microm) and a half-maximum binding concentration (70-185 microm) for the ksl-w peptide when compared with its analog control. significant inhibition of e-selectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (p < 0.0001) as well as hemagglutination of rabbit erythrocytes occurred after the interaction of ksl-w with e. coli lipopolysaccharide. recombinant factor c enzyme detection inhibition revealed dose-dependent inhibition values ranging from 1.0-51.8 microm. which were dependent upon the type of lipopolysaccharide sample tested. conclusion: these results demonstrate that for the concentrations tested, the ksl-w decapeptide was nontoxic to mammalian cells and could bind to and block the host recognition and response towards enteric, as well as oral, lipopolysaccharide samples.

AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine by two different  tests.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial capacity of sodium hypochlorite (1% and 5%) and chlorhexidine (0.12%, 0.5% and 1%) with or without the addition of organic material (bovine serum albumin, bsa) against some bacterial samples (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum) using two activity tests (contact and diffusion agar tests). in the contact test (first model), bacterial samples were kept in contact with each irrigating solution for different time intervals: immediately (t(0)), 5 min (t(5)), 15 min (t(15)) and 30 min (t(30)). the agar diffusion test was the second model used. in half the specimens, 0.5% bsa was added to simulate organic tissue present in the root canal. bacterial growth was evaluated for each microorganism and activity test. each test was repeated 10 times. in the contact test, 0.12% chlorhexidine solution (chx) did not eliminate e. faecalis at any tested time. chx at 0.5% eliminated all strains except e. faecalis after immediate contact. all strains were eliminated by 1% chx, 1% naocl and 5% naocl. bsa did not interfere with the  antimicrobial activity of the irrigating solutions. in the agar diffusion test, all solutions exhibited zones of antimicrobial activity; however, bsa interfered  with the antimicrobial activity of naocl and chx. under the condition of the contact test, the 0.12% chx was ineffective in eliminating e. faecalis, while 0.5% chx, 1% chx, 1% naocl and 5% naocl showed antibacterial effectiveness against all the tested bacterial strains. the addition of an organic load interfered with the accuracy of the agar diffusion test.

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of oxa-63, a new class d beta-lactamase  from brachyspira pilosicoli bm4442.
AB  == brachyspira pilosicoli bm4442, isolated from the feces of a patient with diarrhea at the hospital saint-michel in paris, was resistant to oxacillin (mic > 256 microg/ml) but remained susceptible to cephalosporins and to the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. cloning and sequencing of the corresponding resistance determinant revealed a coding sequence of 807 bp encoding a new class  d beta-lactamase named oxa-63. the bla oxa-63 gene was chromosomally located and  not part of a transposon or of an integron. oxa-63 shared 54% identity with fus-1 (oxa-85), an oxacillinase from fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, and 25 to 44% identity with other class d beta-lactamases (dbls) and contained all the conserved structural motifs of dbls. escherichia coli carrying the bla oxa-63 gene exhibited resistance to benzylpenicillin and amoxicillin but remained susceptible to amoxicillin in combination with clavulanic acid. mature oxa-63 consisted of a 31.5-kda polypeptide and appeared to be dimeric. kinetic analysis  revealed that oxa-63 exhibited a narrow substrate profile, hydrolyzing oxacillin, benzylpenicillin, and ampicillin with catalytic efficiencies of 980, 250, and 150 mm(-1) s(-1), respectively. the enzyme did not apparently interact with oxyimino-cephalosporins, imipenem, or aztreonam. unlike fus-1 and other dbls, oxa-63 was strongly inhibited by clavulanic acid (50% inhibitory concentration [ic50] of 2 microm) and tazobactam (ic50 of 0.16 microm) and exhibited low susceptibility to nacl (ic50 of >2 m). oxa-63 is the first dbl described for the  anaerobic spirochete b. pilosicoli.

TI  == analysis of the antimicrobial activity of local anaesthetics used for dental analgesia.
AB  == seven local anaesthetics and their active anaesthetic components [ultracaine d-s  (articaine hydrochloride), carbostesin (bupivacaine hydrochloride), scandicaine (mepivacaine hydrochloride), xylonest (prilocaine hydrochloride), xylocaine (lidocaine hydrochloride), hostacaine (butanilicaine phosphate) and novocaine (procaine hydrochloride)] were tested for their antimicrobial activity against 311 bacterial strains from 52 different species and 14 candida albicans strains.  the tested pathogens were members of the oral flora, and partly members of the skin and intestinal flora. additionally, the antimicrobial activity of methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate, sodium disulfite, adrenaline hydrogen tartrate and adrenaline (the preservative and vasoconstrictive components of the anaesthetics) was tested. for determination of mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc), the agar dilution method using wilkins-chalgren agar was applied. the trade preparation ultracaine d-s showed the most prominent antimicrobial activity with regard to both mic and mbc. ultracaine d-s and its active substance, articaine hydrochloride, showed similar mic values, suggesting that the antimicrobial activity is mainly caused by the anaesthetic component. novocaine showed the lowest antimicrobial activity and did not inhibit 35 of the species tested. the mic values of all local anaesthetics were between 0.25 and 16 mg ml(-1). the routinely applied concentration of ultracaine d-s was roughly four times higher, and of hostacaine was two times higher, than the mbc values for the tested bacteria, whereas for the other anaesthetics, the mbc values were not reached or exceeded with the concentrations used. the mic range of the preservatives was 0.5-1.0 mg ml(-1) for methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate and 0.2-0.5 mg ml(-1) for sodium disulfite. the articaine mic values were two to three serial dilution steps lower, and the butanilicaine mic values one to two serial dilution steps lower, than the mic of the preservatives. the mepivacaine mean mic values were slightly lower for fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and staphylococcus aureus, but higher for streptococcus  intermedius, compared with the preservative methyl-4-hydroxybenzoate. the same result was found with streptococcus intermedius and lidocaine. screening of 20 mic values of 4 pure anaesthetic substances and the corresponding preservative found 2/20 instances where the mics of the preservatives against 5 representative species (67 strains) were lower, indicating that the antimicrobial effect was mainly due to the preservative, but 18/20 results where the pure anaesthetic component showed greater antimicrobial effects compared with the preservative. the in vitro results for carbostesin, scandicaine and especially for novocaine indicate that a local disinfection should be done prior to injection of the anaesthetics. due to the results obtained with nosocomial strains (escherichia coli, s. aureus and pseudomonas), disinfection of the mucous membranes should be  performed routinely in immunocompromised patients, regardless of the anaesthetic  used.

TI  == improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  == objectives: the microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. however, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. this study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. methods: we evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated nuclisens minimag instrument coupled to 16s rdna sequencing on 76  samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. no pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. results:  our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like neisseria gonorrhoeae and fusobacterium  nucleatum. the overall pcr sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. the overall pcr specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. conclusions: the instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of pcr inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial dna. our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.

TI  == soluble cd14 discriminates slight structural differences between lipid as that lead to distinct host cell activation.
AB  == soluble cd14 (scd14) in serum is known to sensitize host cells to lps. in the present study, the contributions of scd14 and lps-binding protein to a lipid a moiety from lps preparations of periodontopathogenic fusobacterium nucleatum sp.  nucleatum were compared with that of escherichia coli-type synthetic lipid a (compound 506). f. nucleatum lipid a was identified to be a hexa-acylated fatty acid composed of tetradecanoate (c(14)) and hexadecanoate (c(16)), similar to dodecanoate (c(12)) and c(14) in compound 506. the two lipid a specimens exhibited nearly the same reactivity in limulus amoebocyte lysate assays, though  f. nucleatum lipid a showed a weaker lethal toxicity. both lipid a specimens showed nearly the same activities toward host cells in the absence of fbs, though compound 506 exhibited much stronger activity in the presence of fbs, scd14, or scd14 together with lps-binding protein. furthermore, native page/western immunoblot assays demonstrated that f. nucleatum lipid a had a weaker binding to  scd14 as compared with compound 506. these results suggest that scd14 is able to  discriminate the slight structural differences between these lipid as, which causes their distinct host cell activation activities.

TI  == the trimeric periplasmic chaperone skp of escherichia coli forms 1:1 complexes with outer membrane proteins via hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions.
AB  == the interactions of outer membrane proteins (omps) with the periplasmic chaperone skp from escherichia coli are not well understood. we have examined the binding of skp to various omps of different origin, size, and function. these were ompa,  ompg, and yaet (omp85) from escherichia coli, the translocator domain of the autotransporter nalp from neisseria meningitides, foma from fusobacterium nucleatum, and the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel, human isoform 1 (hvdac1) from mitochondria. binding of skp was observed for bacterial omps, but neither for hvdac1 nor for soluble bovine serum albumin. the skp trimer formed 1:1 complexes, omp.skp(3), with bacterial omps, independent of their size or origin. the dissociation constants of these omp.skp(3) complexes were all in the  nanomolar range, indicating that they are stable. complexes of skp(3) with yaet displayed the smallest dissociation constants, complexes with nalp the largest. omp binding to skp(3) was ph-dependent and not observed when either skp or omps were neutralized at very basic or very acidic ph. when the ionic strength was increased, the free energies of binding of skp to ompa or ompg were reduced. electrostatic interactions were therefore necessary for formation and stability of omp.skp(3) complexes. light-scattering and circular dichroism experiments demonstrated that skp(3) remained a stable trimer from ph 3 to ph 11. in the ompa.skp(3) complex, skp efficiently shielded tryptophan residues of the transmembrane strands of ompa against fluorescence quenching by aqueous acrylamide. lipopolysaccharide (lps), a major component of the outer membrane of  gram-negative bacteria, bound to ompa.skp(3) complexes at low stoichiometries. acrylamide quenching of fluorescence indicated that in this ternary complex, the  tryptophan residues of the transmembrane domain of ompa were located closer to the surface than in binary ompa.skp(3) complexes. this may explain previous observations that folding of skp-bound ompa into lipid bilayers is facilitated in presence of lps.

TI  == fada from fusobacterium nucleatum utilizes both secreted and nonsecreted forms for functional oligomerization for attachment and invasion of host cells.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative anaerobe associated with various human infections, including periodontal diseases and preterm birth. a novel fada adhesin was recently identified for host-cell binding. it consists of 129 amino acid residues, with an 18-amino acid signal peptide. expression of fada in escherichia coli enhanced bacterial binding to host epithelial and endothelial cells. in both e. coli and f. nucleatum, fada exists in two forms, the intact pre-fada and the secreted mature fada (mfada), with pre-fada anchored in the inner membrane and mfada secreted outside the bacteria. pre-fada and mfada formed high m(r) complexes. when each form was purified to a single species, mfada was soluble at neutral ph, whereas pre-fada was insoluble. pre-fada became soluble when mixed with mfada or under acidic ph. when fluorescence-labeled mfada alone was added to the epithelial cells, no binding was detected. however, when mixed with nonlabeled pre-fada, binding and invasion of mfada into epithelial cells was observed. fada is a unique bacterial adhesin/invasin in that it utilizes its own  two forms for both structural and functional purposes. the pre-fada-mfada complex is probably anchored in the inner membrane and protrudes through the outer membrane. internalization of the pre-fada-mfada ensures invasion of the bacteria  into the host cells.

TI  == periodontal bacterial dna suppresses the immune response to mutans streptococcal  glucosyltransferase.
AB  == certain cpg motifs found in bacterial dna enhance immune responses through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9) and may also demonstrate adjuvant properties. our objective was to determine if dna from bacteria associated with periodontal disease could affect the immune response to other bacterial antigens in the oral  cavity. streptococcus sobrinus glucosyltransferase (gtf), an enzyme involved in dental caries pathogenesis, was used as a test antigen. rowett rats were injected with aluminum hydroxide (alum) with buffer, alum-gtf, or alum-gtf together with either escherichia coli dna, fusobacterium nucleatum dna, or porphyromonas gingivalis dna. contrary to expectation, animals receiving alum-gtf plus bacterial dna (p. gingivalis in particular) demonstrated significantly reduced serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody, salivary iga antibody, and t-cell proliferation to gtf compared to animals immunized with alum-gtf alone. a diminished antibody response was also observed after administration of alum-gtf with the p. gingivalis dna either together or separately, indicating that physical complexing of antigen and dna was not responsible for the reduction in antibody. since tlr triggering by dna induces synthesis of prospective suppressive factors (e.g., suppressor of cytokine signaling [socs]), the effects  of p. gingivalis dna and gtf exposure on rat splenocyte production of socs family molecules and inflammatory cytokines were investigated in vitro. p. gingivalis dna significantly up-regulated socs1 and socs5 expression and down-regulated interleukin-10 expression by cultured splenocytes. these results suggested that dna from periodontal disease-associated bacteria did not enhance, but in fact suppressed, the immune response to a protein antigen from cariogenic streptococci, potentially through suppressive socs components triggered by innate mechanisms.

TI  == hyperactivity and reactivity of peripheral blood neutrophils in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == some evidence exists that peripheral neutrophils from patients with chronic periodontitis generate higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ros) after fcgamma-receptor stimulation than those from healthy controls. we hypothesized that peripheral neutrophils in periodontitis also show both hyper-reactivity to plaque organisms and hyperactivity in terms of baseline, unstimulated generation  and release of ros. peripheral neutrophils from chronic periodontitis patients and age/sex/smoking-matched healthy controls (18 pairs) were assayed for total ros generation and extracellular ros release, with and without stimulation (fcgamma-receptor and fusobacterium nucleatum), using luminol and isoluminol chemiluminescence. assays were performed with and without priming with escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf). phox gene expression (p22, p47, p67, gp91) was investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr).  neutrophils from patients produced higher mean levels of ros in all assays. total generation and extracellular release of ros by patients' cells were significantly greater than those from controls after fcgammar-stimulation, with (p = 0.023) and without (p < or = 0.023) priming with gm-csf. differences in unstimulated total ros generation were not significant. by contrast, patients' cells demonstrated greater baseline, extracellular ros release than those from controls (p = 0.004). this difference was maintained after priming with lps (p = 0.028) but not gm-csf  (p = 0.217). phox gene expression was similar in patient and control cells at baseline and stimulation with f. nucleatum (3 h) consistently reduced gp91(phox)  transcripts. our data demonstrate that peripheral neutrophils from periodontitis  patients exhibit hyper-reactivity following stimulation (fcgamma-receptor and f.  nucleatum) and hyperactivity in terms of excess ros release in the absence of exogenous stimulation. this hyperactive/-reactive neutrophil phenotype is not associated with elevated phox gene expression.

TI  == crystallization and preliminary x-ray data of the fada adhesin from fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum is a gram-negative anaerobe prevalent in the oral cavity  that is associated with periodontal disease, preterm birth and infections in other parts of the human body. the bacteria attach to and invade epithelial and endothelial cells in the gum tissue and elsewhere via a 13.7 kda adhesin protein  fada (fusobacterium adhesin a). fada exists in two forms: the intact form (pre-fada), consisting of 129 amino acids, and the mature form (mfada), which lacks an 18-residue signal sequence. both forms have been expressed in escherichia coli and purified. mfada has been crystallized. the crystals belong to the hexagonal space group p6(1) or p6(5), with unit-cell parameters a = b = 59.3, c = 125.7 a and one molecule per asymmetric unit. the crystals exhibit an unusually high solvent content of 74%. synchrotron x-ray data have been collected to 1.9 a. the crystals are suitable for x-ray structure determination. the crystal structure of fada may provide a basis for the development of therapeutic  agents to combat periodontal disease and other infections associated with f. nucleatum.

TI  == amphipathic polymers: tools to fold integral membrane proteins to their active form.
AB  == among the major obstacles to pharmacological and structural studies of integral membrane proteins (mps) are their natural scarcity and the difficulty in overproducing them in their native form. mps can be overexpressed in the non-native state as inclusion bodies, but inducing them to achieve their functional three-dimensional structure has proven to be a major challenge. we describe here the use of an amphipathic polymer, amphipol a8-35, as a novel environment that allows both beta-barrel and alpha-helical mps to fold to their native state, in the absence of detergents or lipids. amphipols, which are extremely mild surfactants, appear to favor the formation of native intramolecular protein-protein interactions over intermolecular or protein-surfactant ones. the feasibility of the approach is demonstrated using as models ompa and foma, two outer membrane proteins from the eubacteria escherichia coli and fusobacterium nucleatum, respectively, and bacteriorhodopsin, a light-driven proton pump from the plasma membrane of the archaebacterium halobacterium salinarium.

AB  == previous studies have reported beta-lactamase-mediated penicillin resistance in fusobacterium nucleatum, but no beta-lactamase gene has yet been identified in this species. an f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum strain resistant to penicillin and amoxicillin was isolated from a human periodontitis sample. dna cloning and sequencing revealed a 765-bp open reading frame encoding a new class d beta-lactamase named fus-1 (oxa-85). a recombinant escherichia coli strain carrying the bla(fus-1) gene exhibited resistance to amoxicillin with a moderate  decrease in the mics with clavulanic acid. the bla(fus-1) gene was found in two additional clonally unrelated f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum isolates. it was located on the chromosome in a peculiar genetic environment where a gene encoding a putative transposase-like protein is found, suggesting a possible acquisition of this class d beta-lactamase gene. the fus-1 enzyme showed the closest ancestral relationship with oxa-63 from brachyspira pilosicoli (53% identity) and with putative chromosomal beta-lactamases of campylobacter spp. (40 to 42% identity). fus-1 presents all of the conserved structural motifs of class d beta-lactamases. kinetic analysis revealed that fus-1 exhibits a narrow substrate profile, efficiently hydrolyzing benzylpenicillin and oxacillin. fus-1 was poorly inactivated by clavulanate and nacl. fus-1 is the first example of a class d beta-lactamase produced by a gram-negative, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium to be characterized.

TI  == state-dependent conformations of the translocation pathway in the tyrosine transporter tyt1, a novel neurotransmitter:sodium symporter from fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the gene of a novel prokaryotic member (tyt1) of the neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (nss) family has been cloned from fusobacterium nucleatum. in contrast  to eukaryotic and some prokaryotic nsss, which contain 12 transmembrane domains (tms), tyt1 contains only 11 tms, a characteristic shared by approximately 70% of prokaryotic nss homologues. nonetheless upon heterologous expression in an engineered escherichia coli host, tyt1 catalyzes robust na+-dependent, highly selective l-tyrosine transport. genetic engineering of tyt1 variants devoid of cysteines or with individually retained endogenous cysteines at positions 18 or 238, at the cytoplasmic ends of tm1 and tm6, respectively, preserved normal transport activity. whereas cysteine-less tyt1 was resistant to the inhibitory effect of sulfhydryl-alkylating reagents, n-ethylmaleimide inhibited transport by tyt1 variants containing either one or both of the endogenous cysteines, and this inhibition was altered by the substrates sodium and tyrosine, consistent with substrate-induced dynamics in the transport pathway. our findings support a binding model of tyt1 function in which an ordered sequence of substrate-induced  structural changes reflects distinct conformational states of the transporter. this work identifies tyt1 as the first functional bacterial nss member putatively consisting of only 11 tms and shows that tyt1 is a suitable model for the study of nss dynamics with relevance to structure/function relationships of human nsss, including the dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and gamma-aminobutyric acid transporters.

TI  == folding kinetics of the outer membrane proteins ompa and foma into phospholipid bilayers.
AB  == the folding mechanism of outer membrane proteins (omps) of gram-negative bacteria into lipid bilayers has been studied using ompa of e. coli and foma of f. nucleatum as examples. both, ompa and foma are soluble in unfolded form in urea and insert and fold into phospholipid bilayers upon strong dilution of the denaturant urea. ompa is a structural protein and forms a small ion channel, composed of an 8-stranded transmembrane beta-barrel domain. foma is a voltage-dependent porin, predicted to form a 14 stranded beta-barrel. both omps fold into a range of model membranes of very different phospholipid compositions. three membrane-bound folding intermediates of ompa were discovered in folding studies with dioleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers that demonstrated a highly synchronized mechanism of secondary and tertiary structure formation of beta-barrel membrane proteins. a study on foma folding into lipid bilayers indicated the presence of parallel folding pathways for omps with larger transmembrane beta-barrels.

TI  == anti-inflammatory activity of a high-molecular-weight cranberry fraction on macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting oral tissues. the continuous, high production of cytokines by host cells triggered by periodontopathogens is thought to be responsible for the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. macrophages play a critical role in this host inflammatory response to periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of non-dialyzable material prepared from cranberry juice concentrate on the pro-inflammatory cytokine response of macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharides (lps) from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and escherichia coli. interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta), il-6, il-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and regulated on activation normal t-cell expressed and secreted (rantes) production by macrophages treated with the cranberry fraction prior to stimulation by lps was evaluated by elisa. our results clearly indicate that the cranberry fraction was  a potent inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses induced by lps. this suggests that cranberry constituents may offer perspectives  for the development of a new therapeutic approach to the prevention and treatment of periodontitis.

AB  == membrane protein insertion and folding was studied for the major outer membrane protein of fusobacterium nucleatum (foma), which is a voltage-dependent general diffusion porin. the transmembrane domain of foma forms a beta-barrel that is predicted to consist of 14 beta-strands. here, unfolded foma is shown to insert and fold spontaneously and quantitatively into phospholipid bilayers upon dilution of the denaturant urea, which was shown previously only for outer membrane protein a (ompa) of escherichia coli. folding of foma is demonstrated by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy, by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and by single-channel recordings. refolded foma had a single-channel conductance of 1.1 ns at 1 m kcl, in agreement with the conductance of foma isolated from membranes in native form. in contrast to ompa,  which forms a smaller eight-stranded beta-barrel domain, folding kinetics of the  larger foma were slower and provided evidence for parallel folding pathways of foma into lipid bilayers. two pathways were observed independent of membrane thickness with two different lipid bilayers, which were either composed of dicapryl phosphatidylcholine or dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine. this is the first observation of parallel membrane insertion and folding pathways of a beta-barrel  membrane protein from an unfolded state in urea into lipid bilayers. the kinetics of both folding pathways depended on the chain length of the lipid and on temperature with estimated activation energies of 19 kj/mol (dicapryl phosphatidylcholine) and 70 kj/mol (dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine) for the faster  pathways.

AB  == a large number of bacterial species have been identified in fetal membranes after preterm labour (ptl) associated with intrauterine infection by microbiological culture. in this study, we have investigated a molecular and bioinformatic approach to organism identification which surmounts the need for specific and diverse microbiological culture conditions required by conventional methods. samples of fetal membranes were taken from 37 preterm infants, and 6 normal term  controls delivered by caesarean section, in which bacteria had been detected by in situ hybridization of 16s ribosomal rna using a generic probe. degenerate primers were designed to amplify bacterial 16s ribosomal dna by pcr and used to amplify bacterial dna from human fetal membranes. amplicons were cloned, sequenced and bacteria were identified bioinformatically by comparison of sequences with known bacterial dna genomes. in situ hybridization using an organism specific probe was then used to confirm the presence of the commonest identified organism in tissue samples. bacterial dna amplified from 15/43 samples, all from preterm deliveries, and the bioinformatic approach identified organisms in all cases. multiple bacteria were identified including mycoplasma hominis, pasturella multocida, pseudomonas ph1, escherichia coli and prevotella bivia. the commonest organism fusobacterium nucleatum was found in 9/15 (60%) of  samples. ten of the 12 samples obtained after prolonged membrane rupture were positive for bacterial dna, and 7 of these (70%) contained dna from f. nucleatum. bacteria from fetal membranes may be identified by molecular and bioinformatic methods. further work is warranted to investigate the apparent linkage between f. nucleatum, fetal membrane rupture and preterm delivery.

TI  == antibacterial activity of aqueous extracts of selected chewing sticks.
AB  == this aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity in extracts obtained from various nigerian chewing sticks. aqueous extracts from seventeen chewing sticks and the fruit of c. ferruginea, one fruit used in oral hygiene in  nigeria, were screened for antibacterial activity against type cultures of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. eleven of the test extracts showed activity against at least two of these referenced organisms. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of these eleven extracts against clinical isolates from orofacial infection were determined. all the extracts demonstrated activity against staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates. over half of the extracts were active against enterobacteriaceae and obligate anaerobic isolates, including prevotella melaninogenica, porphyromonas gigivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus prevotii. extracts of the vitellaria paradoxa root, bridellia  ferruginea stem and twigs, garcinia cola stem, terminalia glaucescens root, morinda lucida root, and cnestis ferruginea fruit showed appreciable activity against all classes of bacterial isolates. the extracts of these plants may serve as sources for chemotherapeutic agents for the management of orofacial infections.

TI  == differential induction of human beta-defensin expression by periodontal commensals and pathogens in periodontal pocket epithelial cells.
AB  == background: to investigate the possible role of beta-defensins in gingival health and periodontal disease, we examined the effect of several stimuli on the expression of interleukin-8 (il-8), human beta-defensin-1, -2, -3, and -4 (hbd) in primary human diseased gingival epithelial (hge) cell cultures from periodontitis patients by quantitative taqman reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). methods: several strains of the periodontopathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were added to the cells, as well as the oral commensal bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum and escherichia coli. the induction by the proinflammatory stimuli phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) was also tested. results: in addition to the published observations (pma induces hbd-2 and -4; tnf-alpha induces hbd-2 and -3), it was found that pma can upregulate hbd-1 and hbd-3, whereas tnf-alpha can induce hbd-4. the commensal bacteria were significant inducers of hbd-2, hbd-3, and il-8. the pathogen p. gingivalis induced hbd-1 and hbd-3 at different time points than the commensals,  but no induction of il-8 and hbd-2 could be observed. these data fit with the chemokine paralysis theory. a correlation was found between the pathogenicity of  different serotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans and the induction profiles of defensins and il-8. conclusion: the results suggest that a correlation can be found in diseased oral epithelium between the defensin profiles that are induced  and the pathogenicity of the oral bacterial strains.

TI  == the effects of intra-amniotic injection of periodontopathic lipopolysaccharides in sheep.
AB  == objective: periodontal disease may cause several complications of pregnancy, including fetal death. the purpose of this study was to investigate in sheep the  effects of the intra-amniotic injection of lipopolysaccharide from 3 periodontopathic organisms and to compare these effects with those resulting from similar injection of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. the outcomes that were  studied included the rates of fetal death and the features of inflammation and lung maturation in survivors. study design: at 118 days of pregnancy, ewes that were bearing single fetuses were allocated at random to receive intra-amniotic injections of saline solution (n = 13 fetuses), or lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis (in doses from 0.1 to 10 mg [n = 22 fetuses]), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (10 mg [n = 6 fetuses]; 1 mg [n = 6 fetuses]), fusobacterium nucleatum (10 mg [n = 6 fetuses]) or escherichia coli (10 mg [n = 14 fetuses]; 1 mg [n = 7 fetuses]). surviving fetuses were delivered  abdominally at 125 days of gestation (term, 150 days). results: when compared with escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide at similar dosages, periodontopathic lipopolysaccharides had high rates of fetal lethality. only 6 of 22 fetuses that  were exposed to intra-amniotic porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide survived doses of 0.1 to 10 mg, and only 3 of 6 fetuses survived 10-mg actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide. escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide did not cause fetal loss when given at doses of 10 mg (n = 14  fetuses) or 1 mg (n = 7 fetuses). fetuses that survived exposure to these lipopolysaccharides showed features of inflammation in amniotic fluid and cord blood at birth and enhanced lung maturation. conclusion: lipopolysaccharides from these 3 periodontopathic organisms have much higher rates of fetal lethality than escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide but can cause similar intrauterine inflammatory responses and improvements in lung volumes in survivors. sources of  inflammation that are distant from the uterus may underlie a proportion of unexplained stillbirth and other complications of pregnancy.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum apoptosis-inducing outer membrane protein.
AB  == the periodontal pathogen fusobacterium nucleatum induces apoptosis in lymphocytes. we previously identified the autotransporter protein fap2 in f. nucleatum strain pk1594 that induced apoptosis in lymphocytes when expressed in escherichia coli. in this study, we identified protein homologs of fap2 in the transformable f. nucleatum strain atcc 23726, to determine their role in the induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes. we used a new gene-inactivation vector conferring thiamphenicol resistance (phs31) to construct a mutant deficient in one of the homologs, aim1. transcriptional analyses demonstrated disruption of aim1 expression, and phenotypic analyses revealed a 41% decrease in the ability of the mutant to induce apoptosis in jurkat cells, as compared with the parental  strain. these studies demonstrate, in the native host cell background, the contribution of aim1 to f. nucleatum induction of apoptosis and, to the best of our knowledge, represent the first report of a genetically defined and phenotypically characterized mutation in f. nucleatum.

TI  == detection of heat shock proteins but not superantigen by isolated oral bacteria from patients with behcet's disease.
AB  == we isolated bacteria from periodontal sites and mixed saliva in eight patients with behcet's disease and surveyed them to determine whether they produced heat shock proteins (hsps) and superantigen. cultivable bacterial compositions from periodontal sites and saliva were examined by anaerobic culture using blood agar  plates. gram-negative anaerobic rods such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and capnocytophaga species were predominant in the isolates from the subgingival plaque samples. the streptococcus mitis group was the most common type isolated from the saliva samples. to detect the production of hsps, western  blot analyses were performed using a polyclonal rabbit antibody to escherichia coli dnak and a monoclonal antibody to helicobacter pylori gro-el. sonic extracts of 27 of the strains (79.4%) reacted with the antibody against e. coli dnak. nine of these 34 strains (26.5%) were found to produce hsps that reacted with antibody to h. pylori gro-el. a total of 54 isolates were examined for superantigen activity against human peripheral leukocytes. twenty-five gram-negative clinical  strains isolated from chronic periodontitis lesions and 20 atcc strains of microorganisms were also examined. we could not detect any superantigen activity  in 500x diluted supernatant of the strains isolated from the eight patients with  behcet's disease. the present study indicates that the anaerobic strains isolated from the oral cavity of these patients produce hsps, the production being related to bechet's disease.

TI  == thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone) blocks p. gingivalis- and f. nucleatum, but not  e. coli, lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced interleukin-6 (il-6) production in adipocytes.
AB  == an elevated level of c-reactive protein (crp) predicts the future development of  coronary heart disease. periodontitis appears to up-regulate crp. crp is produced by hepatocytes in response to interleukin-6 (il-6). a major source of il-6 in obese subjects is adipocytes. we hypothesized that lipopolysaccharide (lps) from  periodontal pathogens stimulated adipocytes to produce il-6, and that the production was suppressed by the drugs targeted against insulin resistance, thiazolidinedione (pioglitazone), since this agent potentially showed an anti-inflammatory effect. mouse 3t3-l1 adipocytes were stimulated with e. coli, p. gingivalis, and f. nucleatum lps. the il-6 concentration in culture supernatants was measured. all lps stimulated adipocytes to produce il-6. although pioglitazone changed adipocyte appearance from large to small, and completely suppressed p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum lps-induced il-6 production, e. coli lps-induced il-6 production was not efficiently blocked. thus, pioglitazone completely blocked periodontal-bacteria-derived lps-induced il-6 production in adipocytes, a major inducer of crp.

TI  == characterization of the novel fusobacterium nucleatum plasmid pkh9 and evidence of an addiction system.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum is an important oral anaerobic pathogen involved in periodontal and systemic infections. studies of the molecular mechanisms involved in fusobacterial virulence and adhesion have been limited by lack of systems for  efficient genetic manipulation. plasmids were isolated from eight strains of f. nucleatum. the smallest plasmid, pkh9 (4,975 bp), was characterized and used to create new vectors for fusobacterial genetic manipulation. dna sequence analysis  of pkh9 revealed an open reading frame (orf) encoding a putative autonomous rolling circle replication protein (rep), an orf predicted to encode a protein homologous to members of the ftsk/spoiiie cell division-dna segregation protein family, and an operon encoding a putative toxin-antitoxin plasmid addiction system (txf-axf). deletion analysis localized the pkh9 replication region in a 0.96-kbp fragment. the pkh9 rep gene is not present in this fragment, suggesting  that pkh9 can replicate in fusobacteria independently of the rep protein. a pkh9-based, compact escherichia coli-f. nucleatum shuttle plasmid was constructed and found to be compatible with a previously described pfn1-based fusobacterial shuttle plasmid. deletion of the pkh9 putative addiction system (txf-axf) reduced plasmid stability in fusobacteria, indicating its addiction properties and suggesting it to be the first plasmid addiction system described for fusobacteria. pkh9, its genetic elements, and its shuttle plasmid derivatives can serve as useful tools for investigating fusobacterial properties important in biofilm ecology and pathogenesis.

TI  == implant therapy following liver transplantation: clinical and microbiological results after 10 years.
AB  == background: the number of immunocompromised patients is increasing as a consequence of successful organ transplantation. placing dental implants in these patients has been questioned because of their increased risk for infections. the  10-year follow-up data of a 71-year-old liver transplant recipient with long-term immunosuppressive therapy is reported. six months after liver transplantation, two interforaminal implants were inserted in the edentulous mandible, and an overdenture using non-rigid telescopic attachments was fabricated 3 months later. methods: oral clinical parameters included the modified plaque index, sulcus fluid flow rate, modified bleeding index, probing depth, distance implant mucosa, attachment level, width of the keratinized mucosa and mobility values. the distance implant bone (dib) was determined on digital panoramic radiographs. the  levels of eight periodontal marker organisms were established using dna probe technology. additionally, swabs of the edentulous oral mucosa were taken for microbiological culture and antimicrobial resistance testing. results: the peri-implant parameters were within normal ranges indicating a stable osseointegration with moderate vertical bone loss. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola were not detected. low levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and eikenella corrodens were found. prevotella intermedia was the only bacterium with a level higher than 10(4). the mucosal swabs indicated the presence of an abundant normal oral flora, including escherichia coli and candida albicans. the antibiogram revealed multiple resistance to antibiotics. conclusion: this case report suggests that immunocompromised patients can be successfully rehabilitated with dental implants.

AB  == the purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) against actinomyces odontolyticus (atcc17982), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc2586), streptococcus sanguis (atcc10556), enterococcus faecalis (er3/2s), escherichia coli (sm10lambdapir), staphylococcus aureus (atcc6538), pseudomonas aeruginosa (ume), and candida albicans (atcc10261). two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. mta (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. plates were incubated at 37 degrees c as required for microbial growth. a blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. all mta samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. mta/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). in conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mta.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == induction of calprotectin release by porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide  in human neutrophils.
AB  == calprotectin, a major cytosolic protein of leukocytes, is detected in neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and epithelial cells. this protein is known to be a marker for several inflammatory diseases and is detected in inflammatory  gingival tissue with periodontal disease. recently, we found that the calprotectin level in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontitis patients was significantly higher than that of healthy subjects. however, the regulation of calprotectin in periodontal disease is unclear. in the present study, we investigated the effect of lipopolysaccharides of periodontopathic bacteria on calprotectin release from human neutrophils. neutrophils from healthy donors were treated with lipopolysaccharides from porphyromonas gingivalis (p-lps), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and escherichia coli. calprotectin of neutrophil was identified by immunoblotting and calprotectin amount was determined by elisa. two subunits (10  and 14 kda) of calprotectin were observed in the cell and medium fractions from neutrophils. p-lps increased calprotectin release from seven to 16 times the control level after 30 min and its effect appeared in a dose-dependent manner (10-1000 ng/ml). lipopolysaccharides from a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and e. coli also induced calprotectin release from neutrophils. these results suggest that lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria induce calprotectin release from human neutrophils.

TI  == glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of streptococcus oralis functions as a coadhesin for porphyromonas gingivalis major fimbriae.
AB  == cohesive interactions between porphyromonas gingivalis and plaque-forming bacteria, such as streptococcus oralis, are considered to play an important role  in the colonization of p. gingivalis in periodontal sites. although p. gingivalis fimbriae have been reported to mediate coaggregation with s. oralis, the s. oralis molecule involved has not been identified. we identified the coadhesin of  s. oralis atcc 9811 and purified it by affinity column chromatography. we found that the molecular mass of the purified protein was approximately 40 kda. dot blot and western blot assays showed binding of the 40-kda protein to p. gingivalis fimbriae. further, turbidimetric assays showed that the coadhesin inhibited coaggregation between p. gingivalis and s. oralis in a dose-dependent manner. analyses of the amino-terminal sequences of the protein and its lysyl endopeptidase-cleaved fragments revealed that the coadhesin was identical to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh). next, we cloned the gene that encodes s. oralis gapdh and found that the sequence had a high degree of homology with the sequences of gapdhs of various bacteria, including streptococcus gordonii and fusobacterium nucleatum. to confirm the contribution of s. oralis gapdh to the interaction with p. gingivalis, a recombinant gapdh protein was generated in escherichia coli; this protein bound to p. gingivalis fimbriae and had an inhibitory effect on coaggregation. these results suggest that s. oralis gapdh functions as a coadhesin for p. gingivalis fimbriae. in addition, considering the high degree of homology of the gapdhs of various bacteria, those  of other plaque-forming bacteria also may contribute to the colonization of p. gingivalis.

TI  == detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries by laser fluorescence.
AB  == objectives: detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries in the bottom of deep periodontal pockets is often difficult without visual observation. we thus examined the possibility of its detection using autofluorescence induced by laser irritation. methods: autofluorescence was measured at various excitation and emission wavelength settings in five specimens each of sound dentine and enamel,  subgingival calculus, and root caries. periodontopathic model teeth with bacterial cells and blood clots were also irritated by laser to obtain autofluorescent images. results: subgingival calculus and dentine caries showed a characteristic 700 nm emission when excited at 635 nm or a 720 nm emission when excited at 655 nm; sound dentine or enamel, however, did not. the calculus differentiation power, however, was higher with excitation at 635 nm than at 655  nm. the autofluorescent images photographed at an excitation of 633 nm provided clear calculus identification in periodontopathic model teeth when a 700 nm band-pass filter or a 700 nm high-pass filter was used. however, fluorescence intensity was masked when the calculus surface was covered by bacterial cells or  blood clots. for clinical use, it would be important to remove subgingival plaque and debris from root surfaces before attempting to detect subgingival calculus and root caries with this manner. conclusion: the autofluorescence method employing excitation of 633-635 nm was found to be a powerful tool for detecting  subgingival calculus and root caries.

'mgp' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'mgp' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. results: povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited s. sanguis and a. odontolyticus. 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited s. aureus, s. sanguis, a. odontolyticus and f. nucleatum. neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited growth of e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa. conclusions: compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'mgp' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on s. aureus and f. nucleatum, but not on e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

TI  == palmitoleic acid isomer (c16:1delta6) in human skin sebum is effective against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the percent lipid composition of pooled human sebum analyzed by thin-layer chromatography was: ceramides (13%), fatty acid (47%), cholesterol (7%), cholesterol esters (2%), squalene (11%), triglycerides (3%), and wax esters (17%). total sebum lipids (2- 4 mg/ml), sonicated into bacterial culture medium,  caused 4- to 5-fold log reduction in growth of gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius and the anaerobe fusobacterium nucleatum, but was ineffective against most gram-negative bacteria. fractionation of the sebum lipids showed that both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids contained the bulk of the antimicrobial activity. lauric acid (c12:0) was the most active saturated fatty acid. the unsaturated fatty acid, palmitoleic acid (c16:1delta6, cpa) was both the most predominant monoene and the most active antimicrobial fatty acid. purified cpa (>99%) yielded typical minimal inhibitory  concentration (mic) values of 10-20 microg/ml against gram-positive bacteria. organically synthesized cpa isomer gave mic values comparable to the natural material. both natural and synthetic cpa were found to be the most active sebum lipid fraction in blocking the adherence of a pathogenic strain of candida albicans to porcine stratum corneum. ethanol in combination with cpa exerts a synergistic bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, and  several methacillin-resistant strains of s. aureus. palmitoleic acid may be useful in topical formulations for treatment of secondary gram-positive bacterial infections, as a gram-positive bacteria antimicrobial in wound dressings, and as  a natural gram-positive antimicrobial preservative in skin and hair care products.

TI  == [the neutralizing effect of histidine-rich-polypeptides on lps from suspected periodontal pathogens].
AB  == objective: human parotid histidine-rich-polypeptides (hrps) are a family of lowmolecular-weight, cationic polypeptides. hrp-1, hrp-3 and hrp-5 comprise 85%-90% of the total hrps and are called major hrps. there were many researches indicating the antimicrobial activities of hrps. recently, hrps were reported to  have an inhibitory action on the lipopolysaccharide (lps) of e. coli, with hrp-5  being the most effective one among the three major hrps. since the lps of oral gram-negative bacteria is thought to be one of the important etiological factors  during the development of periodontal diseases, our experiment was aimed to investigate the neutralizing effect of human parotid hrp-5 on the lps of anaerobic suspected periodontal pathogens, which have different chemical structures and biological activities compared with lps of aerobic e. coli. methods: by using of preparative acid urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (au-page), hrp-5 was purified from parotid saliva collected from healthy adults.  two stains of suspected periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g, 47-a) and fusobacterium nuceatum (f. n, separated from subgingival plaque of a patient with adult periodontitis) were mass cultured. after harvested in the midlogarithmic phase, they were washed and lyophilized. the lps of dried bacteria were extracted by the modified westphal hot phenol-water procedures and purified  by the enzyme digestion plus ultracentrifugation. limulus test was applied to test the neutralizing effect of hrp-5 on the lps-induced gelation of limulus amoebocyte lysate. in brief, the standard lps of e. coli, or extracted lps of p.  g or f. n, was preincubated with hrp-5 in a tube separately in room temperature for 10 minutes. then the reagent of limulus amoebocyte lysate was added in all the tubes, continued the incubation in 37 degrees c for one hour. after that, the gelation level of every tube was observed. results: lps extracted from p. g and f. n both showed good purity and strong activities to induce gelation of limulus  amoebocyte lysate. the gelation induced by lps (1 ng/ml) of these two anaerobic suspected periodontal pathogens were weakly inhibited by hrp-5 (10 micrograms/ml), similar to that observed with standard lps of e. coli. to get a complete neutralizing effect on lps, it may be important to increase the concentration of hrp-5. conclusion: it appeared that hrps could neutralize the endotoxic properties of lps of suspected periodontal pathogens, therefore may contribute to periodontal health. the present investigation further confirmed that hrps are important components of the host non-immune defense system.

TI  == structural characterization of the fusobacterial non-specific porin foma suggests a 14-stranded topology, unlike the classical porins.
AB  == native and recombinant foma proteins were extracted by detergent from the cell envelopes of fusobacterium nucleatum and escherichia coli, and purified to near homogeneity by chromatography. circular dichroism analysis revealed that the foma protein consists predominantly of beta-sheets, in line with the previously proposed 16-stranded beta-barrel topology model. results obtained by trypsin treatment of intact cells and cell envelopes of f. nucleatum, and from limited proteolysis of purified foma protein, indicated that the n-terminal part of the foma protein is not an integral part of the beta-barrel, but forms a periplasmic  domain. based on these results a new topology model is proposed for the foma protein, where the c-terminal part forms a 14-stranded beta-barrel separate from  the periplasmic n-terminal domain.

TI  == 3-chloro-dl-alanine resistance by l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase activity.
AB  == the antibacterial agent 3-chloro-dl-alanine (3ca) is an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis. fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, the bacteria responsible for oral malodor, are shown to be resistant to 1 mm 3ca, whereas streptococcus mutans and escherichia coli are sensitive to this antibacterial agent at the same concentration. we isolated the 3ca resistance gene from f. nucleatum and showed that the gene encodes an l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase that catalyzes the alpha,gamma-elimination of l-methionine to produce methyl mercaptan. the enzyme also exhibits 3ca chloride-lyase (deaminating) activity. this antibacterial agent is expected to be useful for specific selection of malodorous oral bacteria producing high amounts of methyl mercaptan.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of brazilian subjects with untreated chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: different periodontopathogenic microbiota have been associated with periodontal diseases in several populations. the present investigation determined the subgingival microbiota of untreated chronic periodontitis brazilians using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. methods: twenty-five periodontitis patients (mean age, 41 +/- 2; mean probing depth [pd], 3.3 +/- 0.2; mean attachment level [al], 3.6 +/- 0.2) with no history of previous periodontal  therapy and a control group of 14 healthy subjects (mean age, 34 +/- 0.6; mean pd, 1.8 +/- 0.2; mean al, 1.7 +/- 0.1) were selected. measurements of pd, al, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation, and suppuration were recorded at 6 sites/tooth. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 4 sites in each tooth/subject in both groups. the presence and levels of 41 subgingival species were determined in 4,032 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. results: periodontal pathogens, as well as some unusual species (e. faecalis, e. coli and bartonella sp.), were detected significantly more often and/or in higher levels in the periodontitis group (p < 0.05). most species were more frequently detected in interproximal sites. b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, e. nodatum, and f. nucleatum ss vincentii showed a significant positive correlation with mean pd and al (p < 0.05). conclusions: the subgingival microbiota of brazilians with untreated chronic periodontitis were complex, including high proportions of periodontopathogens commonly found in other populations, as well as some unusual species.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers against endodontic pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of various types of widely used endodontic sealers have not been compared systematically on facultative or obligate anaerobic endodontic  pathogens. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of  four commonly used endodontic sealers: two epoxy-resin-based sealers (ah26, ah plus), one zinc-oxide eugenol-based sealer (n2), and one calcium hydroxide-based  sealer (sealapex). the testing microbes were four facultative anaerobic species (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus) and four obligate anaerobic species (porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia). the freshly mixed sealers were placed into the prepared wells of agar plates inoculated with the test microorganisms. after varying periods of incubation (2 days for facultative anaerobic species and 7 days for obligate anaerobic species), the zones of growth inhibition were observed and measured. all the sealers were distinctly different from each other in their antimicrobial  activity. the sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on the types  and bacterial strains. n2 containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be the most effective against the microorganisms. the extreme antimicrobial potency of this root canal sealer must be weighted against its pronounced tissue toxic effect.

AB  == the heat-shock response of the oral gram-negative bacterium fusobacterium nucleatum was examined. different strains of f. nucleatum were grown at 37 c. 42  degrees c and 48 c in the presence of [35s]methionine. cellular proteins synthesised after shifts to higher temperatures were analysed by sds-page and autoradiography. strains atcc 10953, f1, f3 and fev1 exhibited heat-shock response, and major proteins were observed at 60, 70 and 90 kda. but increased protein synthesis was also observed for other proteins. immunoblot analysis, using a panel of antibodies directed to epitopes on different known heat-shock proteins revealed cross-reactive proteins, indicating homology between escherichia coli, mycobacterium leprae and f. nucleatum heat shock proteins.

TI  == lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga ochracea are antagonists for human toll-like receptor 4.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlrs) 2 and 4 have recently been identified as possible signal transducers for various bacterial ligands. to investigate the roles of tlrs in the recognition of periodontopathic bacteria by the innate immune system, a chinese hamster ovary (cho) nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab)-dependent reporter cell line, 7.7, which is defective in both tlr2- and tlr4-dependent signaling pathways was transfected with human cd14 and tlrs. when the transfectants were exposed to freeze-dried periodontopathic bacteria, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, and fusobacterium nucleatum, and a non-oral bacterium, escherichia coli, all species of the bacteria induced nf-kappab-dependent cd25 expression in  7.7/hutlr2 cells. although freeze-dried a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, and e. coli also induced cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells, freeze-dried p. gingivalis did not. similarly, lipopolysaccharides (lps) extracted from a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, and e. coli induced cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells, but lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea did not. furthermore, lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea attenuated cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells induced by repurified lps from e. coli. lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea also inhibited the secretion of interleukin-6 (il-6) from u373 cells, the secretion of il-1beta from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and icam-1 expression in human gingival fibroblasts induced by repurified lps from e. coli. these findings indicated that lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea worked as antagonists for human tlr4. the antagonistic activity of lps from these periodontopathic bacteria may be associated with the etiology of periodontal diseases.

TI  == intra- and interspecies regulation of gene expression by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans luxs.
AB  == the cell density-dependent control of gene expression is employed by many bacteria for regulating a variety of physiological functions, including the generation of bioluminescence, sporulation, formation of biofilms, and the expression of virulence factors. although periodontal organisms do not appear to  secrete acyl-homoserine lactone signals, several species, e.g., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum, have recently been shown to secrete a signal related to the autoinducer ii (ai-2) of the signal system 2 pathway in vibrio harveyi. here, we report that the periodontal pathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans expresses a homolog of v. harveyi luxs and secretes an ai-2-like signal. cell-free conditioned medium from a. actinomycetemcomitans or from a recombinant escherichia coli strain (e. coli ais) expressing a. actinomycetemcomitans luxs induced luminescence in v. harveyi bb170 >200-fold over controls. ai-2 levels peaked in mid-exponential-phase cultures of  a. actinomycetemcomitans and were significantly reduced in late-log- and stationary-phase cultures. incubation of early-log-phase a. actinomycetemcomitans cells with conditioned medium from a. actinomycetemcomitans or from e. coli ais resulted in a threefold induction of leukotoxic activity and a concomitant increase in leukotoxin polypeptide. in contrast, no increase in leukotoxin expression occurred when cells were exposed to sterile medium or to conditioned broth from e. coli ais(-), a recombinant strain in which luxs was insertionally inactivated. a. actinomycetemcomitans ai-2 also induced expression of afua, encoding a periplasmic iron transport protein, approximately eightfold, suggesting that luxs-dependent signaling may play a role in the regulation of iron acquisition by a. actinomycetemcomitans. finally, a. actinomycetemcomitans ai-2 added in trans complemented a luxs knockout mutation in p. gingivalis by modulating the expression of the luxs-regulated genes uvrb and hasf in this organism. together, these results suggest that luxs-dependent signaling may modulate aspects of virulence and the uptake of iron by a. actinomycetemcomitans  and induce responses in other periodontal organisms in mixed-species oral biofilm.

TI  == periodontal pathogens produce quorum sensing signal molecules.
AB  == different species of bacteria important in the composition of dental plaque were  tested for production of extracellular autoinducer-like activities that stimulate the expression of the luminescence genes in vibrio harveyi. several strains of prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis were found to produce such activities. interestingly, these bacteria belong to the same phylogenetic group, and they are periodontal pathogens important in the development of periodontal disease. they specifically produce extracellular signaling molecule related autoinducer-2 from v. haveyi. nevertheless, they seem  to be unable to produce homologues of acyl-homoserine lactones. furthermore, escherichia coli dh5alpha can be complemented by the introduction of a p. gingivalis gene with high homology to the luxs gene, which has been called luxs(p.g.).

TI  == topological investigations of the foma porin from fusobacterium nucleatum and identification of the constriction loop l6.
AB  == porin foma in the outer membrane of fusobacterium nucleatum is a trimeric protein, which exhibits permeability properties similar to that of the well-known enterobacterial diffusion porins. the proposed topology model of the foma monomer depicts the beta-barrel motif typical of diffusion porins, consisting of 16 antiparallel beta-strands. to investigate the accuracy of the foma model and assess the topological relationship with other porins, individual deletions of variable size in seven of the eight surface-exposed regions of the porin were genetically engineered. deletions in the predicted loops l1 to l7 were tolerated  by the foma porins, as judged by a normal assembly in the outer membrane of escherichia coli and a sustained pore-forming ability. deletions in the largest proposed external region, loop l6, made the foma porins considerably more permeable to antibiotics, indicating larger pore channels. the distinctly increased uptake rates and size exclusion limits displayed by the l6 deletion mutant porins, suggest that loop l6 folds back into the beta-barrel thereby constricting the native foma channel. thus, the position of the channel constriction loop appears to be shifted towards the c terminus in the foma porin, as compared to the crystal structures of five non-specific diffusion porins.

TI  == effect of lipopolysaccharide from periodontal pathogens on the production of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 by human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == both tissue plasminogen activator (t-pa) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (pai-2) are important proteolysis factors present in inflamed human periodontal tissues. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of lipopolysaccharide (lps) on the synthesis of t-pa and pai-2 by human gingival fibroblasts (hgf). lps from different periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium  nucleatum were extracted by the hot phenol water method. the levels of t-pa and pai-2 secreted into the cell culture media were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa). the mrna for t-pa and pai-2 were measured by rt-pcr. the results showed t-pa synthesis was increased in response to all types  of lps studied and pai-2 level was increased by lps from a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum, but not p. gingivalis. when comparing the effects of lps from non-periodontal bacteria (escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis) with the lps from periodontal pathogens, we found that the ratio of t-pa to pai-2 was greater following exposure of the cells to lps from periodontal pathogens. the highest ratio of t-pa to pai-2 was found in those cells exposed to lps from p. gingivalis. these results indicate that lps derived from periodontal pathogens may cause unbalanced regulation of plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor by hgf and such an effect may, in part, contribute to the destruction of periodontal connective tissue through dysregulated pericellular proteolysis.

TI  == bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  == background: acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. however, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. objective: to determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. study design: tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. the patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. results: aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with  healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; p < 0.01). bacteria belonging to the bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were peptostreptococcus micros (66%), bilophila wadsworthia (63%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (44%), eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (41%). of the aerobes escherichia coli (88%) and streptococcus anginosus group (former streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. conclusions: the shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. the unusually high frequencies of b. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide induces expression of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and the elastin-degrading enzyme, cathepsin s, in human cervical smooth-muscle cells.
AB  == objective: vaginal and amniotic infection with gram-negative bacteria is associated with preterm birth. we previously reported that human cervical smooth-muscle cells (csmc) respond to pro-inflammatory cytokines by expressing enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix. our objective was to characterize  the effects of lipopolysaccharide (lps) from escherichia coli (e coli), bacteroides fragilis, (b frag)and fusobacterium nucleatum (f nuc)on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the elastin-degrading enzyme, cathepsin s, in human csmc. methods: human csmc were exposed to lps and the expression of mrnas encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and cathepsin s, and selected matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) was analyzed by northern blotting. the  effect of cytokine-neutralizing antibodies on lps-induced cathepsin s mrna expression also was determined. results: e coli lps increased expression of cathepsin s 12.5-fold after 12 hours; mmp-1 and mmp-3 mrnas also were increased 2.9- and 3.5-fold, respectively. tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, interleukin (il-1)alpha, and il-1beta mrnas were markedly up-regulated after 3 hours of lps treatment. b frag and f nuc lps also induced tnf-alpha and cathepsin s mrnas. e coli lps caused a sevenfold increase in tnf-alpha secretion after 5 to 8 hours. antihuman tnf-alpha monoclonal antibody, but not a monoclonal antibody to the low-density lipoprotein receptor, reduced the lps-induced increase in cathepsin s mrna by 27%, whereas neutralizing antibodies against il-1alpha and il-1beta did not suppress the response. human csmc were shown to express the toll-like receptor (tlr-2) and tlr-4 genes, which mediate the action of lps. tlr-2 mrna was up-regulated by tnf-alpha. conclusion: csmc respond to lps with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cathepsin s. increases in cathepsin  s mrna result only in part from the rapid induction of tnf-alpha gene expression. tnf-alpha may also augment the csmc response to lps by increasing expression of the lps signaling receptor, tlr-2, which probably directly mediates lps action. these observations provide a mechanism by which gram-negative bacteria can precipitate cervical changes associated with preterm birth.

TI  == in vitro activity of rifaximin, metronidazole and vancomycin against clostridium  difficile and the rate of selection of spontaneously resistant mutants against representative anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, including ammonia-producing species.
AB  == background: rifaximin is a rifamycin derivative characterized by a wide antibacterial activity. this drug is neither absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract nor inactivated by gastric juices, and exerts its action entirely within the intestinal lumen. methods: in this study, the activity of this antibiotic was compared with that of metronidazole and vancomycin against 93 clostridium difficile isolates. the rate of emergence of bacteria spontaneously resistant to  the new compound was also evaluated in relation to representative gram-positive and gram-negative strains. in terms of mic(50) values, rifaximin showed an intrinsic activity superior to that of the other agents. the emergence of spontaneously resistant strains was assessed with 46 aerobic (staphylococci, enterococci, proteus spp., citrobacter freundii, providencia rettgeri, enteropathogenic, enteroinvasive, enterotoxigenic and entero- hemorrhagic escherichia coli, and salmonella enteritidis) and anaerobic (clostridium spp., bacteroides spp., fusobacterium nucleatum and peptococcus spp.) pathogens, most of them also ammonium producers. two different methods, broth and agar dilution,  were employed. results: when liquid medium was employed, bacteria capable of sustained growth in 100 microg/ml of rifaximin were obtained after 2-5 transfers  with gram-positive aerobic cocci, 2-3 transfers with gram-negative aerobic strains and 2-5 transfers with anaerobic species. at the highest dose used with the agar dilution method (8 x mic), the frequency of emergence of spontaneously resistant mutants ranged from <1 x 10(-9) to 1.6 x 10(-8) with gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic cocci, while with aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, this value ranged from <1 x 10(-9) to 1.7 x 10(-7). c. difficile showed a particularly low incidence of spontaneously resistant mutants (<1 x 10(-9)). the low incidence of resistant subpopulations selected by levels of 8 x mic of rifaximin suggests that the high levels of the drug which were reached in the gastrointestinal lumen may further prevent the selection of mutants. conclusion:  the low toxicity, broad antibacterial activity and very poor absorption from the  gastrointestinal tract of rifaximin suggest a potential therapeutic use for this  drug in gastrointestinal diseases, as well as in the management of patients with  cirrhosis and chronic portal-systemic encephalopathy.

TI  == the fusobacterium nucleatum porin foma possesses the general topology of the non-specific porins.
AB  == foma is a major non-specific porin of fusobacterium nucleatum with no sequence similarity to other known porins. according to the topology model, the protein consists of 16 transmembrane beta-strands, connected by eight surface-exposed loops and seven periplasmic turns. in this study, the insertion mutagenesis approach was applied to probe the topology model. a semliki forest virus (sfv) epitope was successfully inserted at 11 different sites of the foma protein and a 6-aa insertion was successfully inserted at two different sites. correct folding  of the mutant proteins and proper incorporation into the outer membrane were assessed by heat modifiability and by an in vivo porin activity assay. immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of intact cells, using mabs directed against the inserted sfv epitope, revealed that three of the eight putative extracellular loops are indeed surface-exposed. trypsin accessibility experiments confirmed the cell surface exposure of two additional loops. the results support  the proposed topology model, showing that foma possesses the general beta-barrel  topology of the non-specific porins, with the interesting exception that the third loop does not seem to fulfil the role of a constriction loop.

TI  == inducible expression of human beta-defensin 2 by fusobacterium nucleatum in oral  epithelial cells: multiple signaling pathways and role of commensal bacteria in innate immunity and the epithelial barrier.
AB  == human gingival epithelial cells (hge) express two antimicrobial peptides of the beta-defensin family, human beta-defensin 1 (hbd-1) and hbd-2, as well as cytokines and chemokines that contribute to innate immunity. in the present study, the expression and transcriptional regulation of hbd-2 was examined. hbd-2 mrna was induced by cell wall extract of fusobacterium nucleatum, an oral commensal microorganism, but not by that of porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen. hbd-2 mrna was also induced by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and phorbol myristate acetate (pma), an epithelial cell activator. hbd-2 mrna was also expressed in 14 of 15 noninflamed  gingival tissue samples. hbd-2 peptide was detected by immunofluorescence in hge  stimulated with f. nucleatum cell wall, consistent with induction of the mrna by  this stimulant. kinetic analysis indicates involvement of multiple distinct signaling pathways in the regulation of hbd-2 mrna; tnf-alpha and f. nucleatum cell wall induced hbd-2 mrna rapidly (2 to 4 h), while pma stimulation was slower ( approximately 10 h). in contrast, each stimulant induced interleukin 8 (il-8) within 1 h. the role of tnf-alpha as an intermediary in f. nucleatum signaling was ruled out by addition of anti-tnf-alpha that did not inhibit hbd-2 induction. however, inhibitor studies show that f. nucleatum stimulation of hbd-2 mrna requires both new gene transcription and new protein synthesis. bacterial lipopolysaccharides isolated from escherichia coli and f. nucleatum were poor stimulants of hbd-2, although they up-regulated il-8 mrna. collectively, our findings show inducible expression of hbd-2 mrna via multiple pathways in hge in  a pattern that is distinct from that of il-8 expression. we suggest that different aspects of innate immune responses are differentially regulated and that commensal organisms have a role in stimulating mucosal epithelial cells in maintaining the barrier that contributes to homeostasis and host defense.

TI  == identification of positively charged residues of foma porin of fusobacterium nucleatum which are important for pore function.
AB  == foma porin is the major outer-membrane protein of fusobacterium nucleatum. it exhibits the functional properties of a general diffusion porin, but has no sequence similarity to other porins. according to the proposed topology model, each monomer of this trimeric protein is a beta-barrel consisting of 16 transmembrane segments with eight surface-exposed loops. several conserved charged residues are proposed to extend from the beta-barrel wall into the aqueous channel lumen, and may contribute to a transverse electric field similar  to that at the pore constriction of porins with known structure. the goal of our  study was to identify particular basic residues contributing to such an electric  field in foma. several arginines and lysines were replaced by negatively charged  glutamates or uncharged alanines. the mutated foma porins were expressed in escherichia coli, and the effects on pore function were studied in vivo, by assaying the uptake rate of beta-lactam antibiotics, and in vitro after reconstitution of the purified proteins in lipid bilayer membranes. some of the point mutations had a significant impact on the channel properties. the substitution r92a produced a 130% increased permeability of the zwitterionic beta-lactam cephaloridine, and the cation selectivity of r92e increased by 70%. the effects of the r90e substitution on channel properties were similar. most of  the point mutations had a minor effect on the voltage gating of the foma channel, resulting in an increased sensitivity, except for k78e, which showed a decreased  sensitivity. the latter mutation had no effect on cation selectivity, but the k78a substitution improved the uptake rate of cephaloridine. the results presented here indicate that arginines 90 and 92 are probably part of the constriction zone of the foma porin, and lysine 78 and arginines 115 and 117 are  probably in close proximity to this region as well.

AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == expression of the peptide antibiotic human beta-defensin 1 in cultured gingival epithelial cells and gingival tissue.
AB  == human beta-defensin-1 (hbd-1) is a member of the family of small cationic antimicrobial peptides that have been identified in several mucosal epithelia. because human gingival epithelium is a site that is constantly challenged by oral microorganisms, we examined the expression of hbd-1 in human gingival epithelial  and fibroblast cell cultures and tissue samples. cell cultures were challenged with cell wall extracts of porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or phorbol myristate acetate. hbd-1 mrna was detected in unstimulated and stimulated cultures by reverse transcription (rt)-pcr using several primer sets specific for hbd-1. gingival epithelial cells, but not gingival fibroblasts, expressed a product of the predicted size for hbd-1 mrna. the sequence of the pcr product was identical to that of hbd-1. hbd-1 mrna expression was not significantly modulated by any of the stimulants tested. human gingival tissues from noninflamed and inflamed sites were also analyzed by rt-pcr. hbd-1 mrna was expressed in all tissue samples. the relative expression of hbd-1 mrna was similar in noninflamed  and inflamed tissues obtained from each of four patients undergoing treatment for periodontitis. however, the relative expression of hbd-1 mrna varied in gingival  biopsies obtained from 15 different normal individuals, and the relative hbd-1 expression was unrelated to interleukin-8 expression. our findings show the constitutive expression of hbd-1 mrna in cultured epithelial cells and gingival tissues but not gingival fibroblasts. these findings suggest that expression of hbd-1 may play a role as part of the innate host defenses in maintaining normal gingival health.

TI  == experimental root canal infections in conventional and germ-free mice.
AB  == a small animal model was evaluated to study the interrelationships between microorganisms after their implantation in root canals (inferior central incisors) using germ-free (gf) and conventional (cv) mice. the selected microorganisms were: porphyromonas endodontalis (atcc 35406), eubacterium lentum  (atcc 25559), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (atcc 27337), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 4083). only p. anaerobius, e. coli, and e. faecalis, respectively, were able to colonize when inoculated alone into the root canal of both cv and gf mice. e. lentum, when inoculated alone colonized only in cv animals. p. endodontalis and f. nucleatum were unable to colonize in cv and gf animals after single inoculation. it is concluded that the experimental animal model presented herein  is valuable for ecological studies of root canal infections and that only some strict anaerobic bacteria are able to colonize mice root canals when inoculated by themselves alone in pure culture.

TI  == dentilisin activity affects the organization of the outer sheath of treponema denticola.
AB  == prolyl-phenylalanine-specific serine protease (dentilisin) is a major extracellular protease produced by treponema denticola. the gene, prtp, coding for the protease was recently cloned and sequenced (k. ishihara, t. miura, h. k.  kuramitsu, and k. okuda, infect. immun. 64:5178-5186, 1996). in order to determine the role of this protease in the physiology and virulence of t. denticola, a dentilisin-deficient mutant, k1, was constructed following electroporation with a prtp-inactivated dna fragment. no chymotrypsin-like protease activity was detected in the dentilisin-deficient mutant. in addition, the high-molecular-mass oligomeric protein characteristic of the outer sheath of  the organism decreased in the mutant. furthermore, the hydrophobicity of the mutant was decreased, and coaggregation of the mutant with fusobacterium nucleatum was enhanced compared to that of the wild-type organism. the results obtained with a mouse abscess model system indicated that the virulence of the mutant was attenuated relative to that of the wild-type organism. these results suggest that dentilisin activity plays a major role in the structural organization of the outer sheath of t. denticola. the loss of dentilsin activity  and the structural change in the outer sheath affect the pathogenicity of t. denticola.

TI  == in vitro determination of direct antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine in vitro the time required for calcium hydroxide in direct contact with microorganisms to express its antimicrobial effect. the microorganisms used were: micrococcus luteus (atcc-9341), staphylococcus aureus (atcc-6538), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc-25586), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc-27853), escherichia coli, and streptococcus sp. the strains were cultivated in brain heart infusion (bhi), with the exception of f. nucleatum (bhi-pras). pure and mixed suspensions of the microorganisms were prepared. paper cones immersed in these substances were covered with calcium hydroxide paste, and after 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h  and 7 days they were transferred to an appropriate medium to observe the growth and multiplication of the microorganisms. incubation was conducted at 37 degrees  c for 48 h, according to the requirements of oxygen of each microorganism. the antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide was shown to occur after 12 h on m. luteus and f. nucleatum, 24 h on streptococcus sp, 48 h on e. coli, and 72 h on s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. mixture ii (m. luteus + streptococcus sp + s. aureus) was sensitive to calcium hydroxide antimicrobial potential after 48 h, whereas mixture i (m. luteus + e. coli + p. aeruginosa), mixture iii (e. coli + p. aeruginosa), and mixture iv (s. aureus + p. aeruginosa) were inactivated after 72 h of exposure.

TI  == secretion of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha, il-8 and il-1ra by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) are the first cells that migrate into periodontal tissues and gingival crevices in response to invading pathogens. it was recently demonstrated that pmn have the ability to synthesize and release cytokines following appropriate stimulation, while it is not clear whether these  capacities are directly related to periodontal destructive processes. we therefore investigated the amounts of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-8 and il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) secreted by pmn from healthy donors following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (lps) from 4 periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea and fusobacterium nucleatum, and the non-oral bacterium escherichia coli. a actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and e. coli lps stimulated the release of significantly greater amounts of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 than the control unstimulated pmn (p < 0.01). the levels of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 released from cells stimulated with p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps were significantly lower than those of cells stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans or e. coli lps (p < 0.05). on the other hand, substantially greater amounts of il-1ra were released from pmn stimulated with each lps and from control unstimulated pmn during the first 6 h, and then significantly greater amounts of il-1ra were secreted by pmn stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans and e.coli lps during the following 12 h (p < 0.01). the inhibitory effects of il-1ra on the biological activity of il-1 in the supernatants of pmn were examined by the thymocyte comitogen proliferation assay. the supernatants of pmn stimulated with each lps showed less biological il-1 activity as compared with the same doses of recombinant human il-1 beta detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. furthermore, no activity was detected in the supernatants of pmn stimulated with  p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps. these findings demonstrated that lps from periodontopathic bacteria were capable of stimulating pmn to release not only pro-inflammatory cytokines but also their inhibitors such as il-1ra. different secretion levels of these cytokines and their biological activities induced by the various lps might be important in the onset and progression of periodontal diseases.

TI  == cloning and expression of foma, the major outer-membrane protein gene from fusobacterium nucleatum t18.
AB  == the major outer-membrane protein. foma, of fusobacterium nucleatum has been associated with porin activity, interbacterial adherence and stimulation of host  immune cells. until now, molecular analysis of foma has not been possible because previous attempts to clone the foma gene were not successful. the inability to clone f. nucleatum genes led to speculation that escherichia coli may not be a suitable host. this report concerns the amplification of the foma gene of f. nucleatum t18 using oligonucleotide primers containing restriction endonuclease sites that allow cloning of foma into the e. coli expression vector pmmb67. the resultant plasmid, pxwi, was transformed into e. coli dh5 alpha, providing high-level expression of recombinant foma (rfoma). amino acid sequencing of rfoma demonstrated that the foma signal peptide was correctly processed by e. coli signal peptidase i. rfoma was correctly localized to the outer membrane by the e. coli export pathway. the rfoma protein also displayed the heat-modifiable oligomeric and conformational properties of native foma (nfoma). this demonstration of rfoma expression, processing, export, and secondary and tertiary structure in e. coli provides support for the feasibility of molecular analysis of the structure and function of foma and other f. nucleatum proteins using recombinant techniques.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  == objective: to study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. design: retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. setting: navy hospital in bethesda, md. results: sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). the predominant aerobic bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), escherichia coli (n = 7), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and klebsiella sp (n =  3). the most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; b fragilis and enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and s aureus and p aeruginosa and citrobacter sp, with burns. conclusion: these data illustrate the  importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.

TI  == viability of four putative periodontal pathogens and enteric rods in the anaerobic transport medium vmga iii.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the survival in vmga iii of porphyromonas  gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and enteric rods in laboratory cultures as well as in subgingival plaque samples. laboratory strains of the 4 putative periodontal pathogens and escherichia coli were used in the laboratory part of this study. also, 31 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 22 periodontal patients and stored in vmga iii. each sample, from both the laboratory and the clinical parts, was divided into 3 portions. one portion was cultured within a few hours of collection (baseline), while the second was processed after 24 h (day 2) and the third 48 h later (day 3). the results of the clinical part indicate that the  detection frequencies of all 4 periodontal pathogens and their levels in positive samples decreased, to different degrees, by day 2 and decreased further by day 3. enteric rods were not detected in base line samples. however, they were present in 16.1% and 22.6% of day 2 and day 3 samples, respectively. similarly, the laboratory results demonstrate a significant decrease in the levels of the 4 periodontal pathogens tested by day 2 and day 3, whereas the opposite occurred for e. coli. p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum survived better in the presence of e. coli than alone, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans survived less well when co-inoculated with e. coli. vmga iii appears to maintain microbial population ratios for periods up to 24 h. after 24 h, the multiplication of enteric organisms may alter the original proportions of the sample.

TI  == insertional inactivation of binding determinants of streptococcus crista cc5a using tn916.
AB  == intermicrobial binding plays an important role in the ecology of the oral cavity  because it represents one mechanism by which specific bacteria colonize dental plaque. the formation of "corncobs", a morphologically distinct microbial unit composed of streptococcus crista and fusobacterium nucleatum, is a highly specific binding interaction that depends on the presence of polar tufts of fimbriae on the streptococci. we have used a genetic approach to examine the role of streptococcal cell surface components involved in the binding of s. crista to  f. nucleatum. such binding may be an important component of corncob formation. a  method for the genetic transformation of s. crista was used to transfer the broad host range transposon, tn916, into the bacteria. cells were grown to early log phase in brain heart infusion broth containing 10% fetal calf serum. the competent cells were mixed with purified dna from pdl916, a plasmid construct consisting of tn916 and the streptococcal/escherichia coli shuttle vector pdl278. over 300 transformants were screened for a reduction in binding to f. nucleatum.  five of the transformants showed a change in binding ranging from 59% to 29% of the positive control values. southern blots revealed that the binding-deficient transformants contained the tn916 element integrated into one of 4 different sites in the chromosome. the transposon, integrated into 4 different sites, appeared to be stable in the absence of selective pressure. based on these findings, it appears that some strains of s. crista are naturally competent and that insertional inactivation methods can be used to facilitate the study of binding receptors in this group of oral streptococci.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == mobile genetic elements of fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the gram-negative anaerobic bacterium, fusobacterium nucleatum, is a predominant  member of the human oral flora. as a major component of subgingival plaque, this  bacterium has a significant impact on the ecology of the oral cavity due to its ability to adhere to many different microbial species. the objective of this study was to identify and characterize plasmids and transposons that may have the potential to be developed into tools for cloning, genetic transformation, and mutagenesis of oral isolates of f. nucleatum. analysis of a collection of laboratory strains resulted in the identification of a homologous family of small cryptic plasmids. plasmids within this family ranged in size from 6.0 to 6.6 kb.  eighteen percent of all strains examined (n = 74) contained dna sequences related to the plasmids. homologous plasmid sequences were found in strains belonging to  2 of the 3 subspecies of the bacterium. the 2 smallest plasmid species were cloned in escherichia coli to facilitate endonuclease restriction mapping. among  the strains examined for plasmids, 5 exhibited resistance to at least 10 micrograms/ml of tetracycline. these strains, all members of the subsp. polymorphum, contained a tetracycline resistance determinant (tetm) as part of a  tn916-like integrated transposon sequence. the tn916-like element and 1 of the plasmid species co-resided in a single strain of the bacterium. hybridization patterns of the tn916-like sequences were identical in all 5 tetracycline-resistant strains. however, these strains appeared to be clonally distinct based on genomic fingerprinting.

(95), bacteroides fragilis  group (80), escherichia coli (43) and bacteroides sp. (39). most strains of b. fragilis group and e. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. most pigmented prevotella sp. and porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). all patients, except two who died, recovered. these findings illustrate the prevalence of fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.

TI  == the effect of cyclosporin and lipopolysaccharide on fibroblasts: implications for cyclosporin-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == drug-induced gingival overgrowth is an adverse side effect associated principally with 3 different types of drugs; specifically the antiepileptic phenytoin, the calcium channel antagonist nifedipine, and the immunosuppressant cyclosporin. the present study has analyzed the effect of cyclosporin and lipopolysaccharide on fibroblasts from 3 different sources: 1) normal healthy human gingiva (nhgf); 2)  overgrown gingiva from 2 patients taking cyclosporin (chgf); and 3) human fetal lung (wi-38). fibroblasts isolated from cyclosporin-associated gingival overgrowth were significantly less responsive to cyclosporin in terms of dna, total protein, and proteoglycan synthesis. this finding supports the in vivo response where few fibroblasts are seen but marked overgrowth of fibrous tissue occurs. lipopolysaccharide derived from fusobacterium nucleatum and escherichia coli was capable of inhibiting dna synthesis significantly in all 3 fibroblast types. total protein synthesis by chgf cells was inhibited differentially by fusobacterium nucleatum lps and addition of cyclosporin to this system resulted in reversal of the inhibition. a synergistic effect was noted when the proteoglycan output of nhgf cells was assessed in response to co-incubation with  cyclosporin and escherichia coli lps. the study shows that bacterial lps may be an important co-factor in the pathogenesis of cyclosporin-induced gingival overgrowth.

TI  == prostaglandin production by amnion and decidual cells in response to bacterial products.
AB  == media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. the bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were group b streptococcus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhea, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum. overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. a similar pattern of results was  obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. in all experiments interleukin 1 beta  consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. it is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.

TI  == the rna polymerases of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum are unrelated to the rna polymerase of escherichia coli.
AB  == western blot analysis that used antisera to the e. coli core enzyme and sigma factors was used for examination of the rna polymerase of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. both antisera reacted with proteins in a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. mutans whole-cell extracts. reactions were seen with some f. nucleatum proteins when the anti-core rna polymerase antisera were used,  but the cross-reacting proteins were not of an expected molecular weight for beta or beta'. no reaction with f. nucleatum proteins was seen when extracts were reacted with antisera to e. coli sigma factor. there were no cross-reacting proteins detected in p. gingivalis extracts with either antisera. these results suggest that e. coli rna polymerase may not be sufficiently similar to p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase for e. coli rna polymerase to recognize p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum promoters. partially purified p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase exhibited a specificity for a p. gingivalis dna template, while having a decreased activity from an e. coli dna template. the antibiotic sensitivity profile of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum rna polymerase activity was shown to differ from that of e. coli, with these activities not being affected by rifampicin, streptovaricin, or streptolydigin. we conclude that the efficient cloning and expression of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum genes in e. coli will require the use of promoter-containing expression vectors.

AB  == blood cultures with strains of aerobic, facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria were studied by quantitative direct gas liquid chromatography for early  diagnosis of bacteraemias. small amounts of volatile and nonvolatile fatty acids  were detected in uninoculated blood cultures. bacteroides fragilis produced acetic (27.6 mumol/ml), propionic (1.0 mumol/ml), isovaleric, (0.6 mumol/ml), lactic (4.5 mumol/ml) and succinic (2.7 mumol/ml) acids after 48 h. blood cultures inoculated with clostridium perfringens and fusobacterium nucleatum produced large amount of butyric acid (2.5 and 18.8 mumol/ml respectively) along  with acetic, propionic, lactic and succinic acids on day 2 of incubation. blood cultures with escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (group a) produced only acetic, lactic and succinic  acids. pseudomonas aeruginosa produced only small amounts of succinic (0.6 mumol/ml) and acetic acids (2.4 mumol/ml) on day 5 of incubation. blood cultures  inoculated with anaerobic bacteria produced multiple volatile fatty acids within  24 to 48 h of incubation. since these acids could be detected earlier than the organism in cultures, they may be useful in the early diagnosis of anaerobic bacteraemias/septicaemias.

TI  == enhancement of the infectivity of fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  == necrobacillosis is caused by fusobacterium necrophorum (fn), but other organisms  are often present in the lesions. their possible role was studied in experiments  made with a virulent fn strain which, by itself, produced fatal necrobacillosis in mice provided that large doses (greater than 10(6) organisms, subcutaneously)  were given. mice were inoculated subcutaneously with fn suspended in sub-lethal doses (0.1 ml) of undiluted or diluted broth cultures of other bacteria. undiluted culture of a strain of escherichia coli reduced the infective dose of fn to less than 10 organisms; in the necrobacillosis lesions that developed, fusobacteria greatly outnumbered e. coli. a heat-killed preparation or sterile filtrate of e. coli culture had little if any effect on fn. citrobacter freundii  and comparatively small numbers of corynebacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes produced effects similar to that of e. coli. an alpha-haemolytic streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium nucleatum also enhanced the infectivity of fn, though less strikingly than e. coli. fn increased the persistence in vivo of the alpha-haemolytic streptococcus and b. fragilis, and enabled the latter to multiply profusely.

TI  == chemiluminescence of peripheral polymorphonuclear leukocytes from adult periodontitis patients.
AB  == polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn's) constitute a primary host resistance factor  against infection. this study investigated the chemiluminescent (cl) response of  peripheral blood pmn's isolated from human subjects with adult periodontitis. 32  subjects were categorized on the basis of age and periodontal disease status into 4 equal groups--young healthy, young diseased, old healthy and old diseased. pmn  cl was stimulated using heat-killed, serum-opsonized fusobacterium nucleatum--a specific periodontopathic gram-negative anaerobe, and escherichia coli as a gram-negative control organism. the results showed a statistically significant enhancement (p less than 0.05) in the cl response, which was cell associated, in  the young diseased subjects. this was not seen in the old subjects (p greater than 0.05), suggesting that in periodontal disease in young subjects the peripheral blood pmns may be in a metabolically activated state. there was nevertheless a degree of variability between individual subjects within each of the 4 clinical groups.

TI  == [inducing effect of periodontopathic bacteria on activation of macrophage functions and production of interleukin-1 by mouse peritoneal macrophages].
AB  == periodontal disease is thought to be initiated by a bacterial infection and subsequently developed by immunopathological mechanisms thorough host-parasite interactions. the macrophage and lymphocyte are the major functional cell types in the lesion of the disease and participate in tissue destruction and alteration of the periodontal connective tissue as well as in host defense mechanisms. however, the detailed implications of macrophages in development of the disease is still unclear. the aim of this study was to gain more understanding of the functional role of macrophages in periodontal disease. in this study, we examined the inducing effects of sonicated extracts from some gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria associated with the pathogenesis of periodontal disease, including bacteroides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans, and actinomyces viscosus, on activation of macrophage functions and il-1 production by the macrophages from the mouse peritoneum. at a  dose as low as 1 microgram/ml (dry weight) sonicated extracts from b. gingivalis  induced an increase in acid phosphatase activity and in glucose consumption of mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. a significant increase in the acid phosphatase and in glucose consumption was observed in the cultures at 24 h and 48 h, respectively, after the addition of the sonicate. sonicated extracts from a. viscosus, a gram-positive bacterium, as well as b. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and h. actinomycetemcomitans, gram-negative ones, were able to induce the increase in acid phosphatase activity and in glucose consumption of the macrophages. these periodontopathic bacteria were found to strongly induce il-1 production by the macrophages as early as 24 h after addition of the sonicates. a significant increase in the il-1 production was observed at a dose of 1 microgram/ml of the sonicates. the inducing ability was equivalent to 1 microgram/ml escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. the highest production of il-1  was observed in the macrophages treated with h. actinomycetemcomitans among these sonicates. sonicated extracts from both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria  were able to induce the il-1 production by macrophages from c3h/hej mice, which are lps low-responders. these results suggest that periodontopathic bacteria have potent ability to induce macrophage activation and il-1 production and that the activated macrophages may play an important role in development of periodontal disease.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == bacterial adherence on replicas of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels.
AB  == a method for determining which molecules in a complex mixture of proteins can function as bacterial receptors was devised. salivary proteins were separated by  sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. bacteria that were metabolically labeled with 3h or externally labeled with 125i were incubated on the nitrocellulose replicas. after 18 h at 4  degrees c, the unbound cells were removed by repeated washing of the replicas, and the bands to which the radiolabeled bacteria bound were visualized by autoradiography. by this technique, fusobacterium nucleatum, which adheres via carbohydrate residues on receptor molecules, and staphylococcus aureus, which recognizes the peptide portion of fibronectin, were shown to bind specifically to their respective receptors. these results suggest that this method can be useful  for profiling bacterial binding to either the carbohydrate or the protein portions of molecules present in complex mixtures, such as those composing biological fluids or tissue substrates. structural specificities, such as recognition sequences formed by certain oligosaccharides, could be further investigated by adding the appropriate simple sugars, as well as oligosaccharide  inhibitors, to the incubation medium. the latter approach is particularly important since most glycoproteins carry multiple n- and o-linked carbohydrate substituents that could serve as bacterial receptors.

TI  == possible existence of a novel amphipathic immunostimulator in the phenol-water extracts of mycobacteriaceae.
AB  == the extracts having diverse immunostimulating activities were obtained as a water-phase fraction from four bacterial species representing the 4 genera (mycobacterium, nocardia, gordona, and rhodococcus) of mycobacteriaceae by the phenol-water method, which is commonly used for extraction of endotoxic lipopolysaccharides (lps) from gram-negative bacteria and amphipathic substances  from gram-positives. these fractions, especially those of g. aurantiaca and r. terrae, showed strong stimulatory effects on murine splenocytes, macrophages of mice and guinea pigs, the immunoadjuvant activities in guinea pigs and mice, and  the distinct activities inducing a tumor necrosis factor and interferons alpha/beta and gamma in primed mice. the fractions from g. aurantiaca and r. terrae exhibited potent pyrogenicity and the ability to activate the clotting enzyme cascade of the horseshoe crab (tachypleus tridentatus). some of these biological activities were not very different from the potency of the reference endotoxic lps derived from escherichia coli or fusobacterium nucleatum. but the test fractions neither showed the activity to prepare rabbit skin to the local shwartzman reaction, nor reacted with anti-lipid a conventional and monoclonal antibodies. furthermore, unlike lps, these fractions stimulated the splenocytes of c3h/hej mice (lps-nonresponder). although the fractions showing the above biological activities have not yet been adequately purified, they contained polysaccharides, whose main constituent sugar is mannose with a smaller amount of arabinose, fatty acids consisting primarily of palmitic, stearic, and tuberculostearic acids, and small amounts of peptides and amino sugars. since components characteristic of known immunomodulators of bacterial origin, namely endotoxins (lipid a's), cell wall peptidoglycans, lipoteichoic acids, cord factors (trehalose dimycolates), or deoxyribonucleic acids, were practically not  detected in these fractions, the agent responsible for the above bioactivities is considered to be a novel substance different from the known, bacterial immunomodulators.

TI  == coagglutination reactions between candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  == an agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. strains of streptococcus sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, s. mitis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with c. albicans. no interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of c. albicans. preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of f. nucleatum and a. viscosus to c. albicans  is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to c. albicans. the possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral  candidal clearance are discussed.

TI  == emergence of beta-lactamase producing anaerobic bacteria in the tonsils during penicillin treatment.
AB  == the emergence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the microflora in the oropharyngeal cavity was studied in ten healthy volunteers treated with 1 g phenoxymethylpenicillin b.i.d. for ten days. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was also investigated. a significant increase in the number of beta-lactamase producing strains of bacteroides species and fusobacterium nucleatum was observed. one beta-lactamase producing staphylococcus aureus strain was recovered in one of the volunteers before the penicillin administration started and three staphylococcus aureus strains produced beta-lactamase after ten days of antibiotic treatment. beta-lactamase-production in haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae or branhamella catarrhalis was not observed before, during or after the antibiotic treatment. beta-lactamase activity was noted in the broth cultures from one volunteer colonized with a beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli strain. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was observed in all volunteers, the activity increasing significantly in parallel to the increase of  beta-lactamase producing bacterial strains. beta-lactamase activity in saliva was completely inhibited in vitro by clavulanic acid and p-chloromercurbenzoate and about 70-80 per cent of the activity was inhibited by cefoxitin. the increase of  beta-lactamase producing bacteria in the oropharynx as a consequence of penicillin treatment raises doubt as to whether penicillin is the drug of choice  in the treatment of tonsillitis caused by group a streptococci when previous treatment has failed.

TI  == the relationship between fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  == mixed infections with three fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. fifteen fusobacterium isolates (eight f. nucleatum, four f. necrophorum, and three f. varium) and one isolate each of bacteroides fragilis, b. asaccharolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, group a beta-haemolytic streptococcus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before  and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. after co-inoculation  of fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, s. aureus and k. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were fusobacterium isolates, while fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than group a streptococci  and e. coli. mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with fusobacterium spp. and k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa or bacteroides spp. suppression of fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with group a streptococci. the additive or synergistic capabilities of fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.

TI  == head-space gas-liquid chromatographic analysis for presumptive identification of  bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  == a total of 445 strains of common aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were analyzed for their volatile microbial metabolites by head-space gas-liquid chromatography. the bacteria were incubated for 24 or 48 h in blood-containing trypticase soy or lombard-dowell glucose broth before being analyzed by automatic head-space injection. from the chromatographic pattern obtained, the majority of klebsiella  pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococci,  bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium nucleatum and propionibacterium acnes could be characterized. the head-space technique developed provides a rapid, direct and easily-performed means for presumptive identification of bacteria found in blood  culture.

TI  == modulation of hla-dr antigens in the gingival epithelium in vitro by heat-killed  fusobacterium nucleatum and e. coli lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == the in vitro influence of the periodontopathic organism fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) on gingival tissue was examined using an organ culture system. treatment of  gingival explants obtained from periodontally diseased sites with suspensions of  fn, stimulated the expression of hla-dr antigens by langerhans cells (lc) in a dose-dependent fashion, and produced a maintenance of the lc markers t6 and atpase. similar effects were seen when e. coli lipopolysaccharide (lps) was substituted for suspensions of fn. with both fn and lps the expression of hla-dr  by gingival keratinocytes was maintained throughout the 72-h culture period, despite the cytotoxic effects of these agents. using a variety of immunohistological techniques and a monoclonal antibody specific for the strain of fn used, it was possible to demonstrate the uptake of fn antigens by lc within the gingival epithelium.

TI  == nature and location of amide-bound (r)-3-acyloxyacyl groups in lipid a of lipopolysaccharides from various gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == it has previously been demonstrated [eur. j. biochem. 124, 191-198 (1982) and 137, 15-22 (1983)] that the lipid a component of salmonella and proteus lipopolysaccharides contains amide-linked (r)-3-acyloxyacyl residues. in the present study lipid a of other gram-negative bacteria was analysed for the presence of amide-bound 3-acyloxyacyl residues. it was found that such residues are constituents of all lipid a tested (agrobacterium tumefaciens, chromobacterium violaceum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, xanthomonas sinensis, bacteroides fragilis, vibrio cholerae, fusobacterium nucleatum, rhodospirillum tenue, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and escherichia coli). amide-linked (r)-3-acyloxyacyl groups, therefore, represent common and ubiquitous structural elements of bacterial lipid a. the composition of 3-acyloxyacyl groups differed considerably among different bacteria. as amide-bound (r)-3-hydroxy fatty acids straight chain and isobranched acyl groups with 10-17 carbon atoms were identified. the most frequently encountered fatty acids, substituting the 3-hydroxyl group of 3-hydroxy fatty acids, were nonhydroxylated straight chain and isobranched acyl residues with 10-17 carbon atoms as well as (s)-2-hydroxy fatty acids with 12 carbon atoms. in some cases, using laser desorption mass spectrometry, the distribution of 3-acyloxyacyl residues over the two available glucosamine amino groups of the lipid a backbone was investigated.

TI  == isolation, partial purification and preliminary characterization of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans rm-10.
AB  == an extracellular bactericidal substance was isolated from the supernatant of streptococcus mutans rm-10 culture fluid and partially purified with 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, differential centrifugation, and gel filtration on sephadex g-200. there was a good correlation of the sensitivity profiles of indicator strains whether assayed on solid medium or with purified material from  cell-free culture fluid, indicating that the same inhibitory substance is produced on solid medium and in broth. vapor from organic solvents such as chloroform, acetone, ethanol, and ether as well as heat treatment at 100 degrees  c for 30 min had little effect on the bactericidal factor. it was sensitive to trypsin and pronase and resistant to deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, lysozyme, and phospholipase c. the inhibitor was not infective, and electron microscopic studies failed to reveal phage or phage-like particles in concentrated solutions  of the bactericidal material. the results indicate that the extracellular bactericidal substance is indeed a bacteriocin. activity in broth cultures reached a maximum only after exponential growth had ceased. it was active against other streptococcal strains as well as strains of actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, but not against strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and escherichia coli.

AB  == twenty-eight patients with anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections were treated with clindamycin alone or clindamycin with gentamicin. sixteen of the patients presented with pneumonitis, nine with necrotizing pneumonia, and three with lung  abscesses. the average length of treatment was 13.8 days, and the duration of temperature after initiation of therapy was 3.1 days. the predominant isolates were anaerobic gram-positive cocci (23 isolates), bacteroides melaninogenicus (14), bacteroides fragilis (9), and fusobacterium nucleatum (11). the most frequent aerobic isolates were alpha-hemolytic streptococci (12), diplococcus pneumoniae (12), pseudomonas aeruginosa (9), klebsiella pneumoniae (7), group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (5), staphylococcus aureus (9), and escherichia coli  (6). all patients responded to the therapy and were cured of the infection. there were no side effects observed from the administration of clindamycin. none of the patients developed any blood dyscrasia, liver damage, diarrhea, or colitis. clindamycin appears to be effective in the treatment of mixed aerobic and anaerobic pleuropulmonary infections in children, alone or with an aminoglycoside when indicated.

TI  == effects of storage in an anaerobic transport system on bacteria in known polymicrobial mixtures and in clinical specimens.
AB  == an anaerobic transport system (ats) which provides for catalytic removal of oxygen was evaluated by using in vitro-prepared polymicrobial mixtures of logphase bacteria and clinical specimens. inoculated swabs were stored at room temperature in (i) aerobic, (ii) anaerobic glove box, and (iii) ats environments, and bacteria were quantitated after 2, 24, 48, and 72 h. bacteria in a three-part mixture of bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and escherichia coli and in a five-part mixture of b. fragilis, p. anaerobius, fusobacterium nucleatum, staphylococcus epidermidis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa survived 72 h of storage in the ats and anaerobic glove box environments, but the anaerobic species were inactivated in the aerobic storage except for b. fragilis in pure culture or in the three-part mixture. changes in relative proportions among the species in a mixture were least in the ats and anaerobic glove box environments and greatest during the aerobic storage, particularly in the five-part mixture. bacteria present in pure or mixed culture in clinical specimens generally survived 72 h of storage in the ats. these data indicate that changes in relative proportions occur with prolonged storage even under anaerobic conditions, but that the ats would be most effective for preserving anaerobic bacteria and preventing drastic concentration changes and overgrowth of facultative and aerobic bacteria.
