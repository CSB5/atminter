TI  == engineering bspqi nicking enzymes and application of n.bspqi in dna labeling and  production of single-strand dna.
AB  == bspqi is a thermostable type iis restriction endonuclease (rease) with the recognition sequence 5'gctcttc n1/n4 3'. here we report the cloning and expression of the bspqir gene for the bspqi restriction enzyme in escherichia coli. alanine scanning of the bspqi charged residues identified a number of dna nicking variants. after sampling combinations of different amino acid substitutions, an nt.bspqi triple mutant (e172a/e248a/e255k) was constructed with predominantly top-strand dna nicking activity. furthermore, a triple mutant of bspqi (nb.bspqi, n235a/k331a/r428a) was engineered to create a bottom-strand nicking enzyme. in addition, we demonstrated the application of nt.bspqi in optical mapping of single dna molecules. nt or nb.bspqi-nicked dsdna can be further digested by e. coli exonuclease iii to create ssdna for downstream applications. bspqi contains two potential catalytic sites: a top-strand catalytic site (ct) with a d-h-n-k motif found in the hnh endonuclease family and a bottom-strand catalytic site (cb) with three scattered glu residues. blastp analysis of proteins in genbank indicated a putative restriction enzyme with significant amino acid sequence identity to bspqi from the sequenced bacterial genome croceibacter atlanticus htcc2559. this restriction gene was amplified by pcr and cloned into a t7 expression vector. restriction mapping and run-off dna sequencing of digested products from the partially purified enzyme indicated that it is an eari isoschizomer with 6-bp recognition, which we named cathi (ctcttc n1/n4).
