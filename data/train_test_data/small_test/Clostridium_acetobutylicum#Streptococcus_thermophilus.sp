TI  == nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the bifidobacterium longum mb 219 lacz gene.
AB  == the gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of escherichia coli from bifidobacterium longum mb219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten bifidobacterium strains tested of the species b. longum, b. breve, b. adolescentis, b. indicum, b. animalis and b. cuniculi. the nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to e. coli revealed the presence of a lacz-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site.  a sequence showing 72% identity with the proline trna of bacillus subtilis and a  gene probably encoding the dna-3-methyladenine glycosydase i were located downstream from the lacz gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. by primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacz gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the  -10 region of the putative promoter. the nucleotide sequence of lacz and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes  and enzymes from other microorganisms. high similarity was demonstrated between the b. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, e. coli, clostridium acetobutylicum, leuconostoc lactis, klebsiella pneumoniae and kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the lacz family. the b. longum mb219 lacz gene was cloned in bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. the expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == a general method for cloning reca genes of gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == an internal fragment of the reca gene from eight gram-positive organisms has been amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction. the internal 348- or 360-bp reca dna segments from bacillus subtilis, clostridium acetobutylicum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus, leuconostoc mesanteroides, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus salivarus subsp. thermophilus were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. the g + c contents of the dna from these species range from 28 to 52%. the sequences of the bacterial reca genes show strong relatedness. this method is particularly useful  for the recovery of the reca genes of gram-positive bacteria and avoids the difficulties of using a genetic complementation test for cloning.
