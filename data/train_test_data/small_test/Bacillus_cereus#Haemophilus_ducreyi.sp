TI  == calorimetric analysis of cephalosporins using an immobilized tem-1 beta-lactamase on ni2+ chelating sepharose fast flow.
AB  == two beta-lactamases, penicillinase type i from bacillus cereus and tem-1 beta-lactamase from haemophilus ducreyi, were immobilized on a chelating sepharose fast flow column loaded with ni2+ in an active form. flow-injection analysis of beta-lactams was performed by using an enzyme column reactor fitted into the enzyme thermistor. with both enzymes it was possible to monitor both penicillins and cephalosporins. moreover, michaelis constants of the tem-1 beta-lactamase were markedly increased upon immobilization for all substrates, especially carbenicillin, cephaloridine, and cefoperazone.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and spectrum of rifaximin, a new topical rifamycin derivative.
AB  == rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. high concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic50, 0.06 microgram/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 0.25 microgram/ml). rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting bacteroides bivius-disiens, gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., and mobiluncus spp. strains (all mics < or = 1 microgram/ml). strains of haemophilus  ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. however, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were  rifaximin resistant, for example, candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, trichomonas vaginalis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to  rifamycin resistance.
