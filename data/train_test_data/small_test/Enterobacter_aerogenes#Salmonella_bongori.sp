TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == phylogenetic relationships of salmonella based on dna sequence comparison of atpd encoding the beta subunit of atp synthase.
AB  == dna sequences covering 57% of atpd encoding the beta subunit of atp synthase were determined for 16 strains of salmonella enterica, two strains of s. bongori, and  one strain each of citrobacter freundii and yersinia enterocolitica, and comparison was made with the published escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes sequences. the phylogenetic tree based on maximum-likelihood analysis showed separation of the subspecies of s. enterica except for two serotypes of subspecies ii which were unsupported by a common node. the two serotypes of s. bongori were separated from s. enterica and related to the serotypes of subspecies ii. a tight relationship was found between s. enterica subspecies iiia consisting of monophasic serotypes and subspecies iiib consisting of diphasic serotypes. this is in conflict with results obtained for most other housekeeping  genes and the 23s rrna gene separating mono- from diphasic subspecies.
