TI  == isolation and characterization of lactic acid bacteria from pobuzihi (fermented cummingcordia), a traditional fermented food in taiwan.
AB  == lactobacillus pobuzihii is a novel species which has been previously found in pobuzihi (fermented cummingcordia), a traditional fermented food in taiwan. however, the lactic acid bacteria (lab) microflora in pobuzihi has not been studied in detail. in this study, lab from pobuzihi were isolated, identified, and characterized. a total of 196 lab were isolated; 79 cultures were isolated from the sample collected from a manufacturing factory, 38 from pobuzihi samples  collected from 4 different markets, and 79 from 2 fresh cummingcordia samples. these isolates were characterized phenotypically and then divided into eight groups (a to h) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna. lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundant lab found in most samples during the fermentation of pobuzihi. on the other hand, enterococcus casseliflavus and weissella cibaria were, respectively, the major species found in the two fresh cummingcordia samples. a potential novel species or subspecies of lactococcal strain was found. in addition, seven l. plantarum and five w. cibaria strains showed inhibitory activity against the indicator strain lactobacillus sakei jcm 1157(t). this is the first report describing the distribution and varieties of lab existing in the pobuzihi during its fermentation process and the final product on the market.

TI  == influence of artisan bakery- or laboratory-propagated sourdoughs on the diversity of lactic acid bacterium and yeast microbiotas.
AB  == seven mature type i sourdoughs were comparatively back-slopped (80 days) at artisan bakery and laboratory levels under constant technology parameters. the cell density of presumptive lactic acid bacteria and related biochemical features were not affected by the environment of propagation. on the contrary, the number  of yeasts markedly decreased from artisan bakery to laboratory propagation. during late laboratory propagation, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) showed that the dna band corresponding to saccharomyces cerevisiae was no  longer detectable in several sourdoughs. twelve species of lactic acid bacteria were variously identified through a culture-dependent approach. all sourdoughs harbored a certain number of species and strains, which were dominant throughout  time and, in several cases, varied depending on the environment of propagation. as shown by statistical permutation analysis, the lactic acid bacterium populations differed among sourdoughs propagated at artisan bakery and laboratory levels. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, and weissella cibaria dominated in only some sourdoughs back-slopped at artisan bakeries, and leuconostoc citreum seemed to be more persistent under laboratory conditions. strains of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis were indifferently found in some sourdoughs. together with the other stable species and strains, other lactic acid bacteria temporarily contaminated the sourdoughs and largely differed between artisan bakery and laboratory levels. the environment of propagation has an undoubted influence on the composition of sourdough yeast and lactic acid bacterium microbiotas.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in spontaneously-fermented buckwheat and teff sourdoughs.
AB  == in this study, four different laboratory scale gluten-free (gf) sourdoughs were developed from buckwheat or teff flours. the fermentations were initiated by the  spontaneous biota of the flours and developed under two technological conditions  (a and b). sourdoughs were propagated by continuous back-slopping until the stability was reached. the composition of the stable biota occurring in each sourdough was assessed using both culture-dependent and -independent techniques.  overall, a broad spectrum of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts species, belonging mainly to the genera lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, kazachstania and candida, were identified in the stable sourdoughs. buckwheat and teff sourdoughs were dominated mainly by obligate or facultative heterofermentative lab, which are commonly associated with traditional wheat or rye sourdoughs. however, the spontaneous fermentation of the gf flours resulted also in the selection of species which are not consider endemic to traditional sourdoughs, i.e. pediococcus pentosaceus, leuconostoc holzapfelii, lactobacillus  gallinarum, lactobacillus vaginalis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus graminis  and weissella cibaria. in general, the composition of the stable biota was strongly affected by the fermentation conditions, whilst lactobacillus plantarum  dominated in all buckwheat sourdoughs. lactobacillus pontis is described for the  first time as dominant species in teff sourdough. among yeasts, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida glabrata dominated teff sourdoughs, whereas the solely kazachstania barnetti was isolated in buckwheat sourdough developed under condition a. this study allowed the identification and isolation of lab and yeasts species which are highly competitive during fermentation of buckwheat or teff flours. representatives of these species can be selected as starters for the production of sourdough destined to gf bread production.

TI  == isolation and characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ripe mulberries in taiwan.
AB  == the objective of this study was to isolate, characterize, and identify lactic acid bacteria (lab) from ripe mulberries collected in taiwan. ripe mulberry samples were collected at five mulberry farms, located in different counties of taiwan. eighty-eight acid-producing cultures were isolated from these samples, and isolates were divided into classes first by phenotype, then into groups by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna). phenotypic and biochemical characteristics led to identification of four bacterial groups (a to d). weissella cibaria was the most  abundant type of lab distributed in four mulberry farms, and lactobacillus plantarum was the most abundant lab found in the remaining farm. ten w. cibaria and one lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis isolate produced bacteriocins against the indicator strain lactobacillus sakei jcm 1157(t). these results suggest that  various lab are distributed in ripe mulberries and w. cibaria was the most abundant lab found in this study.

TI  == isolation and characterization of lactic acid bacteria from yan-dong-gua (fermented wax gourd), a traditional fermented food in taiwan.
AB  == yan-dong-gua (fermented wax gourd; a traditional fermented food in taiwan) samples were collected at five time intervals from a fixed fermenting bucket. eighty-five cultures of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from yan-dong-gua samples, and the isolates were divided into classes by phenotype and then groups by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna. phenotypic and biochemical characteristics identified two bacterial groups (a and b) and showed that the majority of the isolates were heterofermentative lab. weissella cibaria was the major lab found during the initial fermentation of yan-dong-gua. however, it was mostly replaced by w. paramesenteroides after 5 days of fermentation. all isolated lab were able to grow in mrs broth containing 6% nacl. furthermore, the antibacterial activities of the isolates were determined, and five of the isolates showed inhibitory activities against the indicator strain lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei jcm 1157(t). these results suggest that w. cibaria and w. paramesenteroides are the main lab present during the fermentation of yan-dong-gua. this is the first report describing the distribution and varieties of lab that exist in the yan-dong-gua fermentation process.

TI  == biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in french wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific pcr.
AB  == the lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the midi-pyrenees area (south western france) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. however, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. in the present study, a total of 290 lab isolates were identified by pcr amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional french sourdoughs. overall, the lab isolates belonged to 6 genera: lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), pediococcus (38%, 1 species), leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), weissella (4%, 2 species), lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: l. plantarum, l. curvatus, l. paracasei, l. sanfranciscensis, l. pentosus, l. paraplantarum, l. sakei, l. brevis, p. pentosaceus, l. mesenteroides, l. citreum, w. cibaria, w. confusa, l. lactis and  e. hirae. facultative heterofermentative lab represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to l. plantarum and p. pentosaceus. obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (l. sanfranciscencis, l. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas leuconostoc and weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. detection of some lab species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. the number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative lab species have been revealed. results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of lab cocci in the sourdough  ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.

TI  == phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from "alheira", a traditional fermented sausage produced in portugal.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from "alheira", a fermented sausage produced  in portugal. lab were identified to genus and species level by phenotypic characteristics, using genus or species-specific primers and sequencing of the gene encoding 16s rrna. two-hundred and eighty-three isolates were grouped into 14 species. lactobacillus plantarum was isolated from all sausages and enterococcusfaecalis from most of the samples. low numbers of lactobacillus paraplantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus zeae, lactobacillus paracasei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, pediococcus pentosaceus, pediococcus acidilactici, weissella cibaria, weissella viridescens and enterococcus faecium were recorded. the genetic heterogeneity of  l. plantarum and e. faecalis strains were determined by numerical analysis of dna banding patterns obtained by rapd-pcr. strains of l. plantarum and e. faecalis were different from different producers. this study forms the basis from which starter cultures could be selected for production of "alheira".

TI  == characterization and identification of lactic acid bacteria in "morcilla de burgos".
AB  == a total of 176 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from a typical spanish blood sausage called "morcilla de burgos" were identified by means of phenotypic characteristics and 16s rdna rflp (ribotyping). lab were isolated from "morcilla" of different producers and in different storage periods, which includes unpackaged, vacuum and modified atmosphere packaged "morcilla" and vacuum packed  and pasteurised "morcilla". the knowledge of specific spoilage bacteria of "morcilla de burgos" will be useful to design new preservation methods to extend  the shelf-life of this product. identification made according to phenotypic and biochemical characteristics shows the majority of the isolates were heterofermentative lab (93.2%) and eight different bacterial groups could be distinguished (a-g). weisella viridescens was the main species detected (42%). in addition, leuconostoc spp. (23.9%), weissella confusa (11.4%) and lactobacillus fructosus (5.7%) species were found. few strains were phenotypically misidentified as lactobacillus sanfrancisco, pediococcus spp., lactobacillus sakei/curvatus and carnobacterium spp. and 11 strains remained unknown. most of the leuconostocs were identified as leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc carnosum species. ribotyping shows a quite good correlation with phenotypic methods, although it has been possible to identify 15 different clusters. w. viridescens and leuconostocs were also the predominant lab. strains identified as w. confusa by phenotypic characteristics were resolved in w. confusa and weissella cibaria by ribotyping. neither carnobacterium piscicola nor lb. sanfrancisco were identified by means of genotypic method. all lb. fructosus strains and some more included in different phenotypic groups (17 strains in total) could not be associated with any reference strain (cluster vii).
