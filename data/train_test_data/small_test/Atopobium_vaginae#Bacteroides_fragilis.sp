TI  == sensitive detection of thirteen bacterial vaginosis-associated agents using multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is characterized by a polymicrobial proliferation of anaerobic bacteria and depletion of lactobacilli, which are components of natural vaginal microbiota. currently, there are limited conventional methods for bv diagnosis, and these methods are time-consuming, expensive, and rarely allow for  the detection of more than one agent simultaneously. therefore, we conceived and  validated a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (m-pcr) assay for the simultaneous screening of thirteen bacterial vaginosis-associated agents (bv-aas) related to symptomatic bv: gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, mobiluncus mulieris, bacteroides fragilis, mycoplasma hominis, atopobium vaginae, ureaplasma urealyticum, megasphaera type i, clostridia-like bacteria vaginosis-associated bacteria (bvabs) 1, 2, and 3, sneathia sanguinegens, and mycoplasma genitalium. the overall validation parameters of m-pcr compared to single pcr (spcr) were extremely high, including agreement of 99.1% and sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of 100.0%, negative predictive value of 97.0%, accuracy of 99.3%, and agreement with nugent results of 100.0%. the prevalence of bv-aas was very high (72.6%), and simultaneous agents were detected in 53.0%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the m-pcr assay. therefore, the m-pcr assay has great potential to impact bv diagnostic methods in vaginal samples and  diminish associated complications in the near future.

TI  == susceptibility testing of atopobium vaginae for dequalinium chloride.
AB  == background: atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis are major markers for bacterial vaginosis. we aimed to determine the mic and mbc range of the broad-spectrum anti-infective and antiseptic dequalinium chloride for 28 strains, belonging to 4 species of the genus atopobium, i.e. a. vaginae, a. minutum, a. rimae and a. parvulum. methods: the mic was determined with a broth microdilution assay. results: the mic and mbc for atopobium spp. for dequalinium chloride ranged between < 0.0625 and 2 mug/ml. conclusions: this study demonstrated that dequalinium chloride inhibits and kills clinical isolates of a. vaginae at concentrations similar to those of clindamycin and lower than those of metronidazole.
