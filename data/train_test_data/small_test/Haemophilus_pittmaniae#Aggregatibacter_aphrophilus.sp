TI  == classification, identification, and clinical significance of haemophilus and aggregatibacter species with host specificity for humans.
AB  == the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the current classification and identification of haemophilus and aggregatibacter species with exclusive or predominant host specificity for humans. haemophilus influenzae and  some of the other haemophilus species are commonly encountered in the clinical microbiology laboratory and demonstrate a wide range of pathogenicity, from life-threatening invasive disease to respiratory infections to a nonpathogenic, commensal lifestyle. new species of haemophilus have been described (haemophilus  pittmaniae and haemophilus sputorum), and the new genus aggregatibacter was created to accommodate some former haemophilus and actinobacillus species (aggregatibacter aphrophilus, aggregatibacter segnis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). aggregatibacter species are now a dominant etiology of infective endocarditis caused by fastidious organisms (hacek endocarditis), and a. aphrophilus has emerged as an important cause of brain abscesses. correct identification of haemophilus and aggregatibacter species based on phenotypic characterization can be challenging. it has become clear that 15 to 20% of presumptive h. influenzae isolates from the respiratory tracts of healthy individuals do not belong to this species but represent nonhemolytic variants of  haemophilus haemolyticus. due to the limited pathogenicity of h. haemolyticus, the proportion of misidentified strains may be lower in clinical samples, but even among invasive strains, a misidentification rate of 0.5 to 2% can be found.  several methods have been investigated for differentiation of h. influenzae from  its less pathogenic relatives, but a simple method for reliable discrimination is not available. with the implementation of identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, the more rarely encountered species of haemophilus and aggregatibacter will increasingly be identified in clinical microbiology practice. however, identification of some strains will still be problematic, necessitating dna sequencing of multiple housekeeping gene fragments or full-length 16s rrna genes.
