TI  == evaluation of positive interaction for cell growth between bifidobacterium adolescentis and propionibacterium freudenreichii using a co-cultivation system with two microfiltration modules.
AB  == using a co-cultivation system developed previously, positive interaction for cell growth between bifidobacterium adolescentis and propionibacterium freudenreichii  was evaluated. the total dry cell weight (dcw) of these two strains obtained in the co-cultivation system was 1.5-1.7-fold of the sum of the dcws obtained in two single cultivations of each bacterium.

TI  == changes in growth and survival of bifidobacterium by coculture with propionibacterium in soy milk, cow's milk, and modified mrs medium.
AB  == bifidobacterium adolescentis int57 (int57) and propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii atcc 13673 (atcc 13673) were grown either in coculture or as pure cultures in different media, such as cow's milk, soybean milk, and modified  mrs medium. the viable cell counts of bacteria, changes in ph, concentrations of  organic acids, and contents of various sugars were analyzed during incubation up  to 7days. in soy milk, the survival of cocultured int57 was six times higher than the monocultured cells, and atcc 13673 cocultured with int57 consumed 69.4% of lactic acid produced by int57 at the end of fermentation. in cow's milk, coculture with atcc 13673 increased the growth of int57 from 24h until 120h by approximately tenfold and did not affect the survival of int57 cells. after 96h of fermentation of modified mrs, the survival of atcc 13673 cells cocultured with int57 increased by 3.2- to 7.4-folds as compared with atcc 13673 monoculture, whereas the growth of int57 cells was unaffected. the growth and metabolic patterns of two strains during coculture showed noticeable differences between food grade media and laboratory media. the consumption of stachyose in soy milk during coculture of int57 with atcc 13673 was increased by more than twice compared with int57 monoculture, and completed within 24h. the combinational use  of bifidobacterium and propionibacterium could be applied to the development of fermented milk or soy milk products.

TI  == bifidobacterial lipoglycan as a new cause for false-positive platelia aspergillus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reactivity.
AB  == we previously hypothesized that a lipoglycan of bifidobacterium bifidum subsp. pennsylvanicum cross-reacts with the platelia aspergillus (pa) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) based on the presence of galactofuranosyl epitopes in the cell wall (m. a. s. h. mennink-kersten, r. r. klont, a. warris, h. j. m. op den camp, and p. e. verweij, lancet 363:325-327, 2004). we tested this hypothesis by testing bacterial suspensions of different bifidobacterial species and other gram-positive and -negative bacteria with the pa elisa, which is used to detect circulating galactomannan for the serodiagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. furthermore, neonatal fecal samples were enumerated for bifidobacteria by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and tested for pa elisa reactivity. all bifidobacteria, except b. infantis and b. adolescentis, showed reactivity 6- to 600-fold higher compared to the controls (i.e., micrococcus luteus and propionibacterium freudenreichii, which contain a cell wall lipomannan). eggerthella lenta showed a 25-fold-higher reactivity. elisa reactivity was clearly shown to be associated with bacterial lipoglycans containing a beta-1,5-galactofuranosyl chain. all neonatal feces showed pa elisa reactivity and associated numbers of bifidobacteria. since high concentrations of bifidobacteria are present in the human gut, these bacteria or excreted lipoglycan may cause false serum pa elisa reactivity in selected patient groups,  especially neonates.

TI  == growth stimulator for bifidobacteria produced by propionibacterium freudenreichii and several intestinal bacteria.
AB  == a bifidogenic growth stimulator was present in the cell-free filtrate of propionibacterium freudenreichii 7025 culture and in the methanol extract fraction of the cells. several intestinal bacteria, such as bacteroides, enterobacter, and enterococcus, which also released a growth stimulator for bifidobacteria, may play an important role in regulation of a bifidobacterial population in colonic microflora. the water-soluble stimulator from the methanol  extract of the cells was partially purified. the molecular weight of the stimulator appeared to be < 3000. the stimulatory activity was unaffected by treatments with pronase, carboxypeptidase a, ribonuclease, or nuclease p1 and was heat stable over a wide ph range. this stimulator differed from cyanocobalamin and from organic acids, such as acetate and propionate. because it was stable to  heat and proteolytic enzymes, the stimulator is a useful bifidogenic factor that  can reach the large intestine while retaining its activity. short-chain fatty acids were highly inhibitory to the growth of many intestinal bacteria, particularly gram-negative facultative and obligatory anaerobes. the short-chain  fatty acids (especially propionate) stimulated the growth of bifidobacteria. the  growth of bifidobacterium adolescentis 6003 was further enhanced in the presence  of short-chain fatty acids and the stimulator produced by p. freudenreichii 7025. viable counts of strain 6003 grown with bacteroides vulgatus jcm 5826t increased  more than 10(4) over those of the single culture of strain 6003. however, the growth of strain 6003 was inhibited in the mixed culture with clostridium perfringens 7028. in continuous culture, the growth of bifidobacterial strain 6003 could be greatly enhanced, even in the presence of clostridial strain 7028,  in media with short-chain fatty acids and stimulator produced by p. freudenreichii 7025.
