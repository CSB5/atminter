TI  == bacteriological findings in radicular cyst and keratocystic odontogenic tumour fluids from asymptomatic patients.
AB  == objective: in this study the potential presence of bacteria in radicular cyst (rc) and keratocystic odontogenic tumour(kcot) fluids from clinically asymptomatic patients was investigated. materials and methods: cyst fluids were collected by needle aspiration from 16 patients with asymptomatic osteolytic lesions (10 rcs and 6 kcots) undergoing surgery. all samples were transferred into tubes containing pre-reduced transport medium, delivered to the microbiology laboratory and processed within 1h. the cysts, surgically enucleated, were sent for standard histopathological examination. cyst fluid samples were cultured on selective and differential media in anaerobic (for about 2 weeks) and aerobic (for 24-48 h) conditions to detect viable microorganisms. after incubation, the colonies were counted, gram-stained and identified by biochemical tests. results: cultures were positive for the presence of bacteria in 15 (9 rcs, 6 kcots) out of 16 cases. rcs and kcots generally yielded low bacterial counts (10(2)-10(4) cfu/ml) and were predominantly colonized by obligate anaerobes (64%), whereas less commonly by facultative anaerobes (36%). no significant differences in the detection frequencies of obligate and facultative anaerobes were evidenced between rcs and kcots. propionibacterium acnes was the most common obligate anaerobe recovered both in rc and kcot fluids. among facultative anaerobes, gemella morbillorum was more frequently isolated in kcots, whereas staphylococcus spp. in rcs. conclusions: bacteria may be present and persist within fluids of clinically asymptomatic jaw cystic lesions. the influence of bacteria and latent  bacterial infection within cystic jaw lesions should be reconsidered in odontogenic cyst progression.

TI  == investigation of cultivable bacteria isolated from longstanding retreatment-resistant lesions of teeth with apical periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this research was to investigate the presence of viable bacteria in tissue samples from persistent apical lesions and to correlate the microbiological findings with the histopathological diagnosis of the lesion.  methods: twenty persistent apical lesions associated with well-performed endodontic retreatment were collected. tissue samples were processed through culture techniques including serial dilution, plating, aerobic and anaerobic incubation, and biochemical tests for microbial identification followed by histopathological diagnosis. results: cysts were more frequently diagnosed (13/20). strict anaerobic species predominated in both cysts (80.4% of the species detected) and granulomas (65% of the species detected). viable gram-positive bacteria were frequently recovered from apical lesions (cysts = 70.6%, granulomas = 84.4%). gemella morbillorum and propionibacterium acnes were  the most frequently recovered species from cysts and granulomas, respectively. at least 1 gram-positive bacterial species was present in almost every sample (cysts = 12/13, granulomas = 7/7). no significant correlation was found between histologic findings and bacterial species. conclusions: in conclusion, although cysts were more frequent than granulomas in cases of failure of endodontic retreatment, bacteria were isolated from both types of lesions, with a predominance of gram-positive species, suggesting that these species can survive  outside the root canal and might be related to the persistence of the pathological process even after accurate endodontic retreatment.

TI  == shunt nephritis with positive titers for anca specific for proteinase 3.
AB  == the authors report a case of shunt nephritis with antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (anca) and review 2 similar cases. a 55-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for continuous fever and foot edema in 2002. a ventriculoperitoneal  shunt was implanted because of a brain abscess and subsequent hydrocephalus in 1987; it was changed to a ventriculoatrial (va) shunt in 1995. urinary analysis showed proteinuria (5.4 g/d) and microscopic hematuria. laboratory data showed renal dysfunction and hypocomplementemia. anca specific for proteinase 3 (pr3-anca) was positive in his serum, and blood culture grew propionibacterium acnes. renal biopsy results showed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type  i. therefore, the va shunt was replaced, and antibiotics were administered. oral  prednisolone was initiated at a dose of 50 mg/d. proteinuria and the serum levels of creatinine were improved concomitant with normalization of the serum complement levels and the decrease in serum pr3-anca titer. similarly, another 2  cases reported in the literature of pr3-anca-positive shunt nephritis caused by p acnes and gemella morbillorum showed good outcomes after removal of the shunt and administration of antibiotics with or without steroid therapy.
