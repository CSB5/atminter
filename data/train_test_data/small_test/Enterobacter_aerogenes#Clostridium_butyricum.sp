TI  == hydrogen production from glucose by anaerobes.
AB  == various anaerobes were cultivated in media containing glucose. when 100 ml of thioglycollate medium containing 2.0% (w/v) glucose was used, clostridium butyricum atcc 859, nbrc 3315, and nbrc 13949 evolved 227-243 ml of biogas containing about 180 ml of hydrogen in 1 day. although some strains had some resistance against oxygen, c. butyricum atcc 859 and 860 did not have it. c. butyricum nbrc 3315 and enterobacter aerogenes nbrc 13534 produced hydrogen in the presence of glucose or pyruvic acid, and e. aerogenes nbrc 13534 produced hydrogen by not only glucose and pyruvic acid but also dextrin, sucrose, maltose, galactose, fructose, mannose, and mannitol. when a medium containing 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract and 2.0% (w/v) glucose was used, e. aerogenes nbrc 13534 evolved more biogas and hydrogen than c. butyricum nbrc 3315 in the absence of reducing agent.

TI  == microbial hydrogen production from sweet potato starch residue.
AB  == clostridium butyricum could produce hydrogen from a sweet potato starch residue upon supplementation of nitrogen sources. a repeated batch culture using a mixed  culture of c. butyricum and enterobacter aerogenes produced hydrogen with a yield of 2.4 mol h2/mol glucose under a controlled culture ph of 5.25 in a medium consisting of the sweet potato starch residue and 0.1% polypepton without addition of any reducing agents. rhodobacter sp. m-19 produced hydrogen from the  supernatant of the culture broth obtained in the repeated batch culture containing c. butyricum and e. aerogenes when 50 microg/l na2moo4.2h2o and 20 mg/l edta were added to the supernatant and it was cultured under a controlled culture ph of 7.5. a high yield of hydrogen of 7.0 mol h2/mol glucose from the starch remaining in the starch residue was attained in two-step repeated batch cultures containing c. butyricum and e. aerogenes, and by rhodobacter sp. m-19.

TI  == survey, purification, and properties of sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase among microorganisms.
AB  == sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase was purified approximately 500- to 600-fold to apparent homogeneity from escherichia coli b, escherichia coli c, escherichia coli var. communior, escherichia acidilactici, enterobacter aerogenes, neisseria  meningitidis, and saccharomyces cereviseae. the molecular weights of the enzyme as estimated by gel filtration ranged from 97 x 10(3) to 101 x 10(3). the enzyme  was composed of two subunits with the same molecular weight which ranged from 50  x 10(3) to 52 x 10(3), as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. homogeneous enzyme preparations hydrolyse all the tested alpha-d-aldohexose 1-phosphate, d-(keto or aldo)hexose 6-phosphate, and pentose phosphate substrates significantly. when the microorganisms were transferred from growth medium with 1% glucose to that without glucose, there were dramatic increases in both the specific and total enzyme activities. at least three isozymes appeared to be present in s. cereviseae, and two appeared to be present  in e. coli b, e. coli var. communior, and n. meningitidis. rabbit antiserum immunized against sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase purified from e. coli b cross-reacted with both the crude extracts and purified preparations of the enzyme from the other microorganisms. the presence of neither sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase activity nor immunocrossreacting material was detected in the following microorganisms: aspergillus niger, azotobacter chroococcum, bacillus subtilis, bacillus pumilis, citrobacter freundii, clostridium butyricum, corynebacterium xerosis, flavobacterium aquatile, flavobacterium synxanthum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, micrococcus coralinus, neisseria perflava, neurospora crassa, penicilium expansum, penicilium notatum, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas fluorescens, saccharomyces fermenti, sarcina lutea, and streptomyces antibioticus. at present, no conclusive relationship can be established between the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system and the enzyme sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase among microorganisms. the physiological role of sugar phosphate phosphohydrolase as a transferase and regulatory enzyme is discussed.
