TI  == functional analysis of the n-terminal region of endolysin lyb5 encoded by lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage phipyb5.
AB  == lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5 uses endolysin lyb5 and holin hyb5 to burst the host cell. previous results showed that expression of lyb5 in escherichia coli caused host cell lysis slowly, leading us to suppose that lyb5 could pass the cytoplasmic membrane partly. in this work, the function  of a putative signal peptide (splyb5) at the n-terminal of lyb5 was investigated. in e. coli, the cell adopted a spherical shape during induction of lyb5 protein,  while morphological changes were not observed during expression of the splyb5 truncation, indicating that the splyb5 motif may serve as a functional signal peptide. however, splyb5 was not proteolytically cleaved at the predicted site during the translocation of lyb5, and the expressed lyb5 protein appeared in the  cytoplasm, cytoplasmic membrane and periplasm fractions with the same molecular mass. similar results were obtained using lactococcus lactis as a host to express lyb5. these results indicated that splyb5 could direct lyb5 to the periplasm in a membrane-tethered form, and then release it as a soluble active enzyme into the periplasm. in addition, splyb5 could also drive the fused nucleaseb protein to the extracytoplasm environment in e. coli as well as in l. lactis. we proposed that in gram-negative and gram-positive hosts splyb5 acted as a signal-anchor-release domain, which was firstly identified here by experimental evidences in lactic acid bacteria phages. the application of signal-anchor-release domain for endolysin export in bacteriophages infecting gram-positive and gram-negative hosts was discussed.

TI  == unpasteurised commercial boza as a source of microbial diversity.
AB  == boza is a cereal-based fermented beverage widely consumed in many countries of the balkans. the aim of this study was to investigate the microbiota of three bulgarian boza samples through a combination of culture-dependent and -independent methods with the long-term objective of formulating a multi-strain starter culture specifically destined for the manufacture of new cereal-based drinks. the isolation campaign for lactic acid bacteria (lab) allowed the identification of lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus buchneri, pediococcus parvulus and members of the lactobacillus casei group. concerning yeasts, the following isolates were identified: pichia fermentans, pichia norvegensis, pichia guilliermondii (synonym meyerozyma guilliermondii) and torulaspora spp. a high intra-species diversity was revealed by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis. in parallel, microbial dna was directly extracted from the three boza samples, and portions of the rrn operons were analysed through polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). the molecular fingerprinting partially confirmed the results of culturing. among lab, the species weissella confusa, weissella oryzae, leuconostoc citreum, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus parvulus and pediococcus ethanolidurans were detected together with members of the lb. casei group. among the yeasts, the species p. fermentans, m. guilliermondii, galactomyces geotrichum and geotrichum fragrans were found. the overall results confirmed boza as having a rich and heterogeneous biodiversity both in terms of species and genetically diverse strains, thus encouraging its exploitation for the isolation and future technological characterisation of cultures to be selected for the manufacture of innovative cereal-based drinks.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of some lactic acid bacteria isolated from bee pollen: a preliminary study.
AB  == in the present work, five hundred and sixty-seven isolates of lactic acid bacteria were recovered from raw bee pollen grains. all isolates were screened for their antagonistic activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. neutralized supernatants of 54 lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures from 216 active isolates inhibited the growth of indicator bacteria. they were phenotypically characterized, based on the fermentation of 39 carbohydrates. using the simple matching coefficient and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages (upgma), seven clusters with other two members were defined at the 79% similarity level. the following species were characterized: lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus, and unidentified lactobacilli. phenotypic characteristics of major and minor clusters were also identified. partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene of representative isolates from each cluster was performed, and ten strains were assigned to seven species:  lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus ingluviei, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus acidipiscis and weissella cibaria. the molecular method used failed to determine the exact taxonomic status of bh0900 and ah3133.

TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == evaluation of the microbial community, acidity and proximate composition of akamu, a fermented maize food.
AB  == background: akamu is a lactic acid-fermented cereal-based food that constitutes a major infant complementary food in most west african countries. the identities of lab populations from dgge analysis and conventionally isolated lab and yeasts from traditionally fermented akamu were confirmed by pcr sequencing analysis. the relationships between ph, acidity and lactic acid levels and proximate composition of the akamu samples were investigated. results: the lab communities  in the akamu samples comprised mainly lactobacillus species, including lb. fermentum, lb. plantarum, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and lb. helveticus, as  well as lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris. identified yeasts were candida tropicalis, candida albicans, clavispora lusitaniae and saccharomyces paradoxus.  low ph (3.22-3.95) was accompanied by high lactic acid concentrations (43.10-84.29 mmol kg(-)(1)). protein (31.88-74.32 g kg(-)(1)) and lipid (17.74-36.83 g kg(-)(1) contents were negatively correlated with carbohydrate content (897.48-926.20 g kg(-)(1), of which </=1 g kg(-)(1) was sugars). ash was  either not detected or present only in trace amounts (</=4 g kg(-)(1)). energy levels ranged from 17.29 to 18.37 kj g(-)(1). conclusion: the akamu samples were  predominantly starchy foods and had ph < 4.0 owing to the activities of fermentative lab.

TI  == the dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == stable integration and expression of heterologous genes in several lactobacilli using an integration vector constructed from the integrase and attp sequences of  phage phiat3 isolated from lactobacillus casei atcc 393.
AB  == an integration vector capable of stably integrating and maintaining in the chromosomes of several lactobacilli over hundreds of generations has been constructed. the major integration machinery used is based on the phiat3 integrase (int) and attp sequences determined previously. a novel core sequence located at the 3' end of the trna(leu) gene is identified in lactobacillus fermentum atcc 14931 as the integration target by the integration vector though most of such sequences found in other lactobacilli are similar to that determined previously. due to the lack of an appropriate attb site in lactococcus lactis mg1363, the integration vector is found to be unable to integrate into the chromosome of the strain. however, such integration can be successfully restored  by cotransforming the integration vector with a replicative one harboring both attb and erythromycin resistance sequences into the strain. furthermore, the integration vector constructed carries a promoter region of plact from the chromosome of lactobacillus rhamnosus tcell-1 which is used to express green fluorescence and luminance protein genes in the lactobacilli studied.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of a spontaneous cocoa bean fermentation metagenome reveals new insights into its bacterial and fungal community diversity.
AB  == this is the first report on the phylogenetic analysis of the community diversity  of a single spontaneous cocoa bean box fermentation sample through a metagenomic  approach involving 454 pyrosequencing. several sequence-based and composition-based taxonomic profiling tools were used and evaluated to avoid software-dependent results and their outcome was validated by comparison with previously obtained culture-dependent and culture-independent data. overall, this approach revealed a wider bacterial (mainly gamma-proteobacteria) and fungal diversity than previously found. further, the use of a combination of different classification methods, in a software-independent way, helped to understand the actual composition of the microbial ecosystem under study. in addition, bacteriophage-related sequences were found. the bacterial diversity depended partially on the methods used, as composition-based methods predicted a wider diversity than sequence-based methods, and as classification methods based solely on phylogenetic marker genes predicted a more restricted diversity compared with  methods that took all reads into account. the metagenomic sequencing analysis identified hanseniaspora uvarum, hanseniaspora opuntiae, saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactobacillus fermentum, and acetobacter pasteurianus as the prevailing species. also, the presence of occasional members of the cocoa bean fermentation process was revealed (such as erwinia tasmaniensis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and oenococcus oeni). furthermore, the sequence reads  associated with viral communities were of a restricted diversity, dominated by myoviridae and siphoviridae, and reflecting lactobacillus as the dominant host. to conclude, an accurate overview of all members of a cocoa bean fermentation process sample was revealed, indicating the superiority of metagenomic sequencing over previously used techniques.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from sour congee in inner mongolia of china.
AB  == sour congee is a popular food in the western regions of inner mongolia in china.  it has a complex microbial population, which contributes to its unique flavor and functional properties. in this study, we chose 28 sour congee samples that were collected from different areas in inner mongolia for analysis of the microbial community of lactic acid bacteria (lab) by classical biochemical tests, 16s rrna  gene sequencing, multiplex pcr assay of reca gene and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis of the tuf gene (encoding elongation factor tu). the results revealed that all the isolates were identified as lactobacillus (l.) paracasei (38 strains), l. fermentum (28 strains), l. plantarum (7 strains), l. brevis (4 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. amylolyticus (1 strain), enterococcus (e.) faecalis (3 strains), e. italicus (2 strains) or lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (1 strain). the predominant lab were l. casei and l. fermentum in sour congee samples. the diversity of lab derived from sour congee could offer useful information for further research on sour congee, and the results demonstrated that the combination of tuf gene and rflp patterns can be considered as a useful tool for differentiation of the l. casei group.

TI  == the investigation of probiotic potential of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional mongolian dairy products.
AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) isolated from traditional mongolian dairy products, and to estimate the probiotic potential of the isolated strains. we collected 66 samples of the traditional mongolian dairy products tarag (n = 45), airag (n = 7), aaruul (n = 8), byasulag (n = 1) and eezgii (n = 5), from which 543 lab strains were isolated and identified based on 16s ribosomal dna sequence. the predominant species of those products were lactobacillus (l.) delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, l. helveticus, l. fermentum, l. delbrueckii ssp. lactis and lactococcus lactis ssp.  lactis. however, we could not detect any lab strains from eezgii. all lab isolates were screened for tolerance to low ph and to bile acid, gas production from glucose, and adherence to caco-2 cells. in vitro, we found 10 strains possess probiotic properties, and almost identified them as l. plantarum or l. paracasei subspecies, based on 16s ribosomal dna and carbohydrate fermentation pattern. these strains were differentiated from each other individually by randomly amplified polymorphic dna analysis. additionally, it was notable that 6/10 strains were isolated from camel milk tarag from the dornogovi province.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of bacterial populations during spontaneous sorghum fermentations used to produce ting, a south african food.
AB  == ting is a spontaneously fermented sorghum food that is popular for its sour taste and unique flavour. insight of the microbial diversity and population dynamics during sorghum fermentations is an essential component of the development of starter cultures for commercial production of ting. in this study, bacterial populations associated with spontaneous sorghum fermentations were examined using a culture-independent strategy based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis of v3-16s rrna gene amplicons, and a culture-dependent strategy using conventional isolation based on culturing followed by 16s rrna and/or phes gene sequence analysis. the entire fermentation process was monitored over a 54 h period and two phases were observed with respect to ph evolution and  microbial succession. the first phase of the process (0-6h) was characterized by  relatively high ph conditions and the presence of enterococcus mundtii, albeit that this species was only detected with the culture-dependent approach. the second phase of the fermentation process (12-54 h) was characterized by increased acidity and the predominance of a broader range of lactic acid bacteria, including lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, weissella cibaria, enterococcus faecalis, and a close relative of lactobacillus curvatus, as well as some members of the enterobacteriaceae family. the lb. curvatus-like species was only detected with pcr-dgge, while the majority of the other species was only detected using the culture-dependent approach. these findings highlighted the fact that a combination of both approaches was essential in revealing the microbial diversity and dynamics during spontaneous sorghum fermentations.

TI  == analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented west african cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  == in this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. in particular, pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16s rrna gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. dna sequencing of the highly variable v3 region of the 16s rrna genes obtained from pcr-dgge fingerprints identified species related to weissella confusa, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus amylolyticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bacillus spp. and lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. a more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16s rrna gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the streptococcaceae family. interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. for example, l. plantarum, l. pantheris and l. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while w. confusa, streptococcus lutetiensis and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were  found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to diplay heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

AB  == the objective of this study was to isolate lactic acid bacteria (lab) from vacuum packaged beef and to investigate their antagonist activity. lab mean counts of 5.19 log cfu/cm(2) were obtained from five samples of vacuum packaged beef. two hundred isolates were selected and screened for the inhibitory effect on five atcc reference lactobacillus strains. thirty six isolates showed activity in the  agar spot test against at least two of the indicator strains. however, only six cell free supernatants (cfs) from these isolates exhibited activity against the indicator strains using the well-diffusion test and conditions that eliminated the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide. l. acidophilus was the most sensitive indicator tested, whereas l. plantarum and l. fermentum were the most resistant ones. identification by midi system indicated that these lab isolates were lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, pediococcus acidilactici, lactobacillus  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus casei gc subgroup a. the antagonistic factors produced by most of these lab against l. acidophilus were resistant to heat treatment (100 degrees c for 10 min) and stable over a wide ph  range (4.0 to 9.0). these data suggest that these isolates could be used as promising hurdles aiming increased safety and extended shelf life of meat products.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of lysostaphin and a listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage  endolysin produced and secreted by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the expression and secretion signals of the sep protein from lactobacillus fermentum br11 were used to direct export of two peptidoglycan hydrolases by lb.  fermentum br11, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus plantarum atcc 14917 and lactococcus lactis mg1363. the production levels, hydrolytic and bacteriocidal activities of the listeria monocytogenes bacteriophage n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase endolysin ply511 and the glycylglycine endopeptidase lysostaphin were examined. buffering of the growth media to a neutral ph allowed detection of ply511 and lysostaphin peptidoglycan hydrolytic activity from all lactic acid bacteria. it was found that purified ply511 has a ph activity range similar to that of lysostaphin with both enzymes functioning optimally under alkaline conditions. supernatants from lactobacilli expressing lysostaphin reduced viability of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) by approximately 8 log(10) cfu/ml compared to controls. however, supernatants containing ply511 were unable to control l. monocytogenes growth. in coculture experiments, both lb. plantarum and lb. fermentum synthesizing lysostaphin were able to effectively reduce mrsa cell numbers by >7.4 and 1.7 log(10)cfu/ml, respectively, while lactic acid bacteria secreting ply511 were unable to significantly inhibit the growth of l. monocytogenes. our results demonstrate that lysostaphin and ply511 can be expressed in an active form from different lactic acid bacteria and lysostaphin showed superior killing activity.  lactobacilli producing lysostaphin may have potential for in situ biopreservation in foodstuffs or for prevention of s. aureus infections.

TI  == monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab) during shochu fermentation was monitored by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and by bacteriological culturing. no lab were detected from fermented mashes by pcr-dgge using a universal bacterial pcr primer set. however, pcr-dgge using a new primer  specific for the 16s rdna of lactococcus, streptococcus, tetragenococcus, enterococcus, and vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16s rdna of lactobacillus, pediococcus, leuconostoc, and weissella revealed that enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus nagelii, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. it was also found that the lab community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. therefore, we confirmed that pcr-dgge using all three primers specific for groups of lab together was well suited to the study of the lab diversity in shochu mashes. the results of dgge profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. in conclusion, lab are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.

TI  == growth of lactic acid bacteria and rhizopus oligosporus during barley tempeh fermentation.
AB  == the zygomycete rhizopus oligosporus is traditionally used to ferment soybean tempeh, but it is also possible to ferment other legumes and cereals to tempeh. the traditional soybean tempeh harbours a multitude of microorganisms with potentially beneficial or detrimental effects on quality. lactic acid bacteria (lab) have positive effects on the safety of soybean tempeh, but the effects of lab on r. oligosporus growth have not been investigated. we have developed a cereal grain tempeh by fermenting pearled barley with r. oligosporus atcc 64063.  four lab species, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus reuteri and lactococcus lactis were assessed for their growth abilities and their effects on r. oligosporus growth during barley tempeh fermentation. growth of lab was assayed as colony forming units (cfu), while growth of r. oligosporus was measured as ergosterol content and hyphal length. the two fungal measurements highly correlated (r=0.83, p<0.001, n=90). the ergosterol content of fungal mycelia ranged from 11.7 to 30.1 mg/g fungal dry matter. l. plantarum multiplied  from 4.8 to 7.4 log cfu/g dry tempeh and l. fermentum increased from 4.4 to 6.8 log cfu/g during 24 h incubation at 35 degrees c. l. reuteri and l. lactis had significantly slower growth, with increases from 4.8 to 5.6 log cfu/g and 5.0 to  5.4 log cfu/g, respectively. the growth of r. oligosporus and the final ph (4.9)  in barley tempeh were not significantly influenced by any of the lab investigated.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from lactobacillus fermentum br11.
AB  == screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole lactobacillus fermentum br11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kda protein. analysis of the 3010-bp dna insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (orfs). one orf encodes lysa,  a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages lj928 and lj965 from lactobacillus johnsonii and lp1 and lp2 from  lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage phiadh. the immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated orf downstream of lysa which has similarity to glutamyl-trna synthetases. the n-terminus of lysa has sequence similarity with n-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the c-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial sh3b domains. c-terminal bacterial  sh3b domains were identified in the majority of lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. lysa was expressed in escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different lactobacillus species and against lactococcus lactis, streptococci and  staphylococcus aureus. it was found that lysa is 2 and 8000 times more active against l. fermentum than l. lactis and streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == indigenous raw milk microbiota influences the bacterial development in traditional cheese from an alpine natural park.
AB  == nostrano di primiero is a 6-month ripened cheese produced from raw milk collected in the paneveggio-pale di san martino natural park area in the italian dolomites. in summer, this cheese is made using milk collected from two different areas, passo rolle and vanoi, in the paneveggio natural park. during the experiment, the milk from the two areas was separately processed, and cheeses were made in the same cheese factory using the same technological process. the microbiota of raw milk and cheeses of the two areas was isolated and the dominant population was monitored by rapd analysis and identified by 16s rrna sequence. the milk of the passo rolle area was mainly composed of mesophilic strains, thermophilic streptococcus thermophilus, and low amounts of enterococci were also found; the milk of the vanoi area was dominated by mesophilic microbiota mostly lactococcus  lactis ssp. cremoris and ssp. lactis and lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei.  the plating of the natural starter culture revealed the presence of a relevant community of thermophilic cocci and lower amounts of enterococci. the dynamic population analysis showed the importance of the natural starter culture in the first 2 days of cheese ripening in both cheeses. moreover, the large biodiversity observed in the raw milks was also detected in the cheeses during ripening. the vanoi cheese was dominated by enterococcus faecium and streptococcus macedonicus  in the first two days and mesophilic 21 lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei became the most represented population after 15 days of ripening. in the first few days, the rolle cheese was characterized by being mainly composed of thermophilic s. macedonicus and s. thermophilus and secondarily by mesophilic cocci. during ripening, the microbiota composition changed, and at 15 days, mesophilic lactobacilli were the dominant population, but later, this was mainly composed of mesophilic cocci and lactobacilli. the taxonomical identification by 16s rrna sequence confirmed a large biodiversity related to raw milk microbiota and only five strains of s. macedonicus, lactobacillus plantarum, 21 lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum and e. faecium were detected in both cheeses.

TI  == the potential of dairy lactic acid bacteria to metabolise amino acids via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination.
AB  == the metabolism of amino acids by 22 starter and 49 non-starter lactic acid bacteria (lab) was studied in a system consisting of amino acids and non-growing  cells without added amino acceptors such as alpha-ketoglutarate. there were significant inter- and intra-species differences in the metabolism of amino acids. some amino acids such as alanine, arginine, aspartate, serine and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) were utilised, whereas other amino acids such as glycine, ornithine and citrulline were produced. alanine and aspartate were utilised by some lab and accumulated during  the incubation of other lab. arginine was degraded not only by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (the lactococcal subspecies known to catabolise arginine), but also by pediococci, heterofermentative lactobacilli (lactobacillus brevis and lb. fermentum) and some unidentified homofermentative lactobacilli. serine was utilised predominantly by homofermentative lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei, lb. rhamnosus and lb. plantarum. of the lab studied, lb. brevis and lb. fermentum were the most metabolically active, utilising alanine, arginine, aspartate, glutamate and branched-chain amino acids. leuconostocs were the least metabolically active, showing little potential to metabolise amino acids. the formation of ammonia and acetate from amino acid metabolism varied both between species and between strains within species. these findings suggest that the potential of lab for amino acid metabolism via non-transaminating reactions and endogenous transamination will impact both on the physiology of lab and on cheese ripening, especially when transamination is rate-limiting in the absence of an exogenous amino acceptor such as alpha-ketoglutarate.

TI  == isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  == one hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using api 50 chl kits  and additional biochemical tests. coliforms, yeasts and lab were enumerated in bushera. the ph, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. the lab counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). the coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). the ph of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. the initial numbers of lab and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the lab numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. lab counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. the ph declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to lactobacillus, streptococcus and enterococcus genera. tentatively, lactobacillus isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. lab isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus. eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch  and were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), weissella confusa (one strain) and l. plantarum (one strain).

TI  == diversity, dynamics, and activity of bacterial communities during production of an artisanal sicilian cheese as evaluated by 16s rrna analysis.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the microbial communities during the manufacturing  of ragusano cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in sicily (italy), were investigated by a combination of classical and culture-independent approaches. the latter included pcr, reverse transcriptase-pcr (rt-pcr), and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna genes (rdna). bacterial and lactobacillus group-specific primers were used to amplify the v6 to v8 and v1 to  v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene, respectively. dgge profiles from samples taken during cheese production indicated dramatic shifts in the microbial community structure. cloning and sequencing of rdna amplicons revealed that mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (lab), including species of leuconostoc, lactococcus lactis, and macrococcus caseolyticus were dominant in the raw milk, while streptococcus thermophilus prevailed during lactic fermentation. other thermophilic lab, especially lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus fermentum, also flourished during ripening. comparison of the rrna-derived patterns obtained by rt-pcr to the rdna dgge patterns indicated a substantially different degree of metabolic activity for the microbial groups detected. identification of cultivated lab isolates by phenotypic characterization and 16s rdna analysis indicated a variety of species, reflecting to a large extent the results obtained from the 16s rdna clone libraries, with the significant exception of the lactobacillus delbrueckii  species, which dominated in the ripening cheese but was not detected by cultivation. the present molecular approaches combined with culture can effectively describe the complex ecosystem of natural fermented dairy products, giving useful information for starter culture design and preservation of artisanal fermented food technology.

TI  == the potential of a polyphasic pcr-dgge approach in evaluating microbial diversity of natural whey cultures for water-buffalo mozzarella cheese production: bias of  culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses.
AB  == a polyphasic pcr-dgge approach was used to describe the microbial population occurring in natural whey cultures (nwcs) for water-buffalo mozzarella cheese production. total microbial community was assessed without cultivation by analyzing dna directly extracted from the original samples of nwc. in addition, dna extracted from bulks of cells formed by harvesting colonies from the serial dilution agar plates of a variety of culture media was used to profile the "cultivable" community. the 16s rdna v3 region was amplified using dna from nwc as well as dna from bulks as templates and the amplicons were separated by dgge.  the microbial entities occurring in nwcs were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing of dgge bands: four lactic acid bacteria (lab) closest relative of streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus crispatus were revealed by the analysis of dna directly extracted from nwc while two other lab, lactobacillus fermentum and enterococcus faecalis,  were identified by analyzing dna from the cultivable community. the developed pcr-dgge analysis of the "cultivable" community showed good potential in evaluating microbial diversity of a dairy environment: it usefully highlighted the bias introduced by selective amplification when compared to the analysis of the total community from nwc and allowed suitability of media and growth conditions to be evaluated. moreover, it could be used to complete the culture independent study of microbial diversity to give information on concentration ratios among species occurring in a particular environment and can be proposed for rapid identification of dominant microorganisms in alternative to traditional tools.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular identification and clustering of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts from wheat (species triticum durum and triticum aestivum) sourdoughs of southern italy.
AB  == the microflora of 25 wheat sourdoughs from the apulia region, southern italy, was characterized. the sourdoughs were mainly produced from triticum durum wheat. the number of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts ranged from ca. log 7.5 to log 9.3 colony forming units (cfu)/g and from log 5.5 to log 8.4 cfu/g, respectively. about 38% of the 317 isolates of lactic acid bacteria were identified by conventional physiological and biochemical tests. phenotypic identification was confirmed by 16s rdna and 16s/23s rrna spacer region pcr. overall, 30% of the isolates were identified as lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, 20% as lb. alimentarius, 14% as lb. brevis, 12% as leuconostoc citreum, 7% as lb. plantarum, 6% as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 4% as lb. fermentum and lb. acidophilus,  2% as weissella confusa and 1% as lb. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. some of these species have not been previously isolated from sourdoughs. since bakers yeast is widely used in sourdough production, saccharomyces cerevisiae was largely found. the phenotypical relationships within the main lactic acid bacteria identified were established by using cluster analysis. a microbial map of the 25 sourdoughs was plotted showing characteristic associations among lactic acid bacteria and differences in the lactic acid bacteria species which were mainly due to the species of wheat flour, use of bakers yeast and type of bread.

AB  == the broad-host-range plasmid pam beta 1 (erythromycin resistance) was transferred conjugally from streptococcus lactis to lactobacillus reuteri, l. murinus, and l. fermentum. transfer of pam beta 1 between two l. reuteri strains occurred, and lactobacillus transconjugants could act as donors of pam beta 1 in crosses with enterococcus faecalis jh2-2.
