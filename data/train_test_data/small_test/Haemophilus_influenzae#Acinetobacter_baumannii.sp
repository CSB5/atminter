TI  == development of two real-time multiplex pcr assays for the detection and quantification of eight key bacterial pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the frequent lack of a positive and timely microbiological diagnosis in patients  with lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) is an important obstacle to antimicrobial stewardship. patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but, because these  are often slow, negative, or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice. the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two multiplex real-time pcr assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. we found that all eight bacterial targets could be reliably quantified from sputum specimens down to a concentration of 100 cfus/reaction (8333 cfus/ml). furthermore, all 249 positive control isolates were correctly detected with our assay, demonstrating effectiveness on both reference strains and local clinical isolates. the specificity was 98% on a panel of nearly 100 negative control isolates. bacterial load was quantified accurately when three bacterial targets were present in mixtures of varying concentrations, mimicking likely clinical scenarios in lrti.  concordance with culture was 100% for culture-positive sputum specimens, and 90%  for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, and additional culture-negative bacterial infections were detected and quantified. in conclusion, a quantitative  molecular test for eight key bacterial causes of lrti has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time-point of patient admission than current standard methods. this should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == global assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility among gram-negative organisms collected from pediatric patients between 2004 and 2012: results from the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial.
AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) was designed to monitor  susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents among important pathogens. we report here on susceptibility among gram-negative pathogens collected globally from pediatric patients between 2004 and 2012. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using guidelines published by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). most enterobacteriaceae showed high rates of susceptibility (>95%) to amikacin, tigecycline, and the carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem); 90.8% of acinetobacter baumannii isolates were susceptible to minocycline, and susceptibility rates were highest in north america, europe, and asia/pacific rim. amikacin was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa (90.4% susceptibility), with susceptibility rates being highest in north america. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were reported for 11.0% of escherichia  coli isolates and 24.2% of klebsiella pneumoniae isolates globally, with rates reaching as high as 25.7% in the middle east and >43% in africa and latin america, respectively. statistically significant (p<0.01) differences in susceptibility rates were noted between pediatric age groups (1 to 5 years, 6 to  12 years, or 13 to 17 years of age), globally and in some regions, for all pathogens except haemophilus influenzae. significant (p<0.01) differences were reported for all pathogens globally and in most regions, considerably more frequently, when pediatric and adult susceptibility results were compared. amikacin, tigecycline, and the carbapenems were active in vitro against most gram-negative pathogens collected from pediatric patients; a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were susceptible to fewer antimicrobial agents. susceptibility rates among isolates from pediatric patients were frequently different from those among isolates collected from adults.

TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of china.
AB  == background: bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aecopd). therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. so far, data on this topic among chinese are lacking. methods: a surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with aecopd at five areas in china between october 2006 and april 2008. the sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. results: three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with aecopd. the predominant bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and escherichia coli (3.6%). the majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. conclusions: gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with aecopd in china. haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in aecopd. this study provides evidence for local surveillance of aecopd pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in china.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

TI  == high burden of antimicrobial resistance in asia.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. marked variations in the resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens as well as the quality of public hygiene have had a considerable impact on the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents in asian countries. in asia, one of  the epicentres of antimicrobial drug resistance, there is an alarming number of antibiotic-resistant species, including penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, multidrug-resistant (mdr) acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (particularly mediated by ctx-m-9, ctx-m-14 and ctx-m-15), new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (ndm-1)-producing enterobacteriaceae, mdr salmonella enterica serotypes choleraesuis and typhi, carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii (oxa-58 and oxa-23 carbapenemases) and azole-resistant candida glabrata. a few clones of mdr a. baumannii and hospital-acquired meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) have been widely disseminated in hospital settings in asia, and k. pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing k. pneumoniae strains have been widely distributed  in china. in addition, the emergence of extensively drug-resistant mycobacterium  tuberculosis (xdr-tb) has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of resistance profiles of clinical isolates as well as the deliberative use of fluoroquinolones. continuous surveillance of resistance data from clinical isolates as well as implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings are required to mitigate the progression of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia in trauma patients is associated with lower mortality: results from eu-vap study.
AB  == background: differences in trauma patients developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) are described regarding etiology and risk factors associated. we  aim to describe the differences in outcomes in trauma and nontrauma patients with vap. methods: a prospective, observational study conducted in 27 intensive care units from nine european countries. we included patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for >48 hours who developed vap. logistic regression model was used to assess the factors independently associated with mortality in trauma  patients with vap. results: a total of 2,436 patients were evaluated; 465 developed vap and of these 128 (27.5%) were trauma patients. trauma patients were younger than nontrauma (45.3 +/- 19.4 vs. 61.1 +/- 16.7, p < 0.0001). nontrauma had higher simplified acute physiology score ii compared with trauma patients (45.5 +/- 16.3 vs. 41.1 +/- 15.2, p = 0.009). most prevalent pathogens in trauma  patients with early vap were enterobacteriaceae spp. (46.9% vs. 27.8%, p = 0.06)  followed by methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (30.6% vs. 13%, p = 0.03) and then haemophilus influenzae (14.3% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.02), and the most prevalent pathogen in late vap was acinetobacter baumannii (12.2% vs. 44.4%, p <  0.0001). mortality was higher in nontrauma patients than in trauma patients (42.6% vs. 17.2%, p < 0.001, odds ratio [or] = 3.55, 95%ci = 2.14-5.88). a logistic regression model adjusted for sex, age, severity of illness at intensive care unit admission, and sepsis-related organ failure assessment score at the day of vap diagnosis confirmed that trauma was associated with a lower mortality compared with nontrauma patients (odds ratio [or] = 0.37, 95%ci = 0.21-0.65). conclusions: trauma patients developing vap had different demographic characteristics and episodes of etiology. after adjustment for potential confounders, vap episodes in trauma patients are associated with lower mortality  when compared with nontrauma patients.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == streptococcus pneumoniae coinfection is correlated with the severity of h1n1 pandemic influenza.
AB  == background: initial reports in may 2009 of the novel influenza strain h1n1pdm estimated a case fatality rate (cfr) of 0.6%, similar to that of seasonal influenza. in july 2009, however, argentina reported 3056 cases with 137 deaths,  representing a cfr of 4.5%. potential explanations for increased cfr included virus reassortment or genetic drift, or infection of a more vulnerable population. virus genomic sequencing of 26 argentinian samples representing both  severe and mild disease indicated no evidence of reassortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs, or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence. furthermore, no evidence was found for increased frequency of risk factors for h1n1pdm disease. methods/principal findings: we examined nasopharyngeal swab samples (nps) from 199 cases of h1n1pdm infection from argentina with masstag pcr, testing for 33 additional microbial agents. the  study population consisted of 199 h1n1pdm-infected subjects sampled between 23 june and 4 july 2009. thirty-nine had severe disease defined as death (n = 20) or hospitalization (n = 19); 160 had mild disease. at least one additional agent of  potential pathogenic importance was identified in 152 samples (76%), including streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 62); haemophilus influenzae (n = 104); human respiratory syncytial virus a (n = 11) and b (n = 1); human rhinovirus a (n = 1)  and b (n = 4); human coronaviruses 229e (n = 1) and oc43 (n = 2); klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2); acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2); serratia marcescens (n = 1); and staphylococcus aureus (n = 35) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa, n = 6). the presence of s. pneumoniae was strongly correlated with severe disease. s. pneumoniae was present in 56.4% of severe cases versus 25% of mild cases; more than one-third of h1n1pdm nps with s. pneumoniae were from subjects with severe disease (22 of 62 s. pneumoniae-positive nps, p = 0.0004). in subjects 6 to 55 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (or) of severe disease in the presence of s. pneumoniae was 125.5 (95% confidence interval [ci], 16.95, 928.72; p<0.0001).  conclusions/significance: the association of s. pneumoniae with morbidity and mortality is established in the current and previous influenza pandemics. however, this study is the first to demonstrate the prognostic significance of non-invasive antemortem diagnosis of s. pneumoniae infection and may provide insights into clinical management.

AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == sputum bacteriology in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in taiwan with an emphasis on klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == background and objective: bacterial infection is one of the major causes of acute exacerbation of copd (aecopd). this study was undertaken to investigate the microbiology of aecopd. methods: medical records from 494 episodes of aecopd in patients admitted to the national taiwan university hospital from january 2000 to june 2004 were reviewed. severity of copd was classified according to the 2003 global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease guideline. results: potential pathogenic microorganisms were isolated from patients in 328 (66.4%) episodes of aecopd. the predominant bacteria were klebsiella pneumoniae (19.6%),  pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.8%) and haemophilus influenzae (7.5%), followed by acinetobacter baumannii (6.9%), enterobacter species (6.1%) and staphylococcus aureus (6.1%). the incidence of streptococcus pneumoniae was 2.4%. spirometry results obtained within 1 year of the exacerbation were available in 186 cases. k. pneumoniae was more frequently isolated in stage i copd (39.1%) than stage ii  (16.6%), iii (13.8%) and iv (9.4%). no glucose non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli were isolated in stage i patients. multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that p. aeruginosa (odds ratio (or) 3.19; 95% confidence interval (ci): 1.21-8.38), intubation (or 14.81; 95% ci: 5.08-43.12) and age (or  1.1; 95% ci: 1.03-1.17) were independent risk factors for mortality. conclusions: klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa are the most common sputum pathogens in hospitalized patients with aecopd in taiwan, with the former being more commonly  isolated from mild copd and the latter associated with poor clinical outcome. these results should be considered when deciding which antibiotics should initially be used to treat patients with aecopd.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance surveillance: vira study 2006].
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two vira studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. methods: in february 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant haemophilus  influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli (365), pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and acinetobacter baumannii (92). the hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. susceptibility was determined with  a broth microdilution method. results: among the non-penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). among mrsa, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin mic of 4  microg/ml. the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli was 12.1%. resistance of a. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). conclusion: these results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.

TI  == nosocomial pneumonia : rationalizing the approach to empirical therapy.
AB  == nosocomial pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) causes considerable morbidity and mortality. it is the second most common nosocomial infection and the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infections. in 1996 the american thoracic society (ats) published guidelines for empirical therapy of hap. this review focuses on the literature that has appeared since the ats statement. early diagnosis of hap and its etiology is crucial in guiding empirical therapy. since 1996, it has become clear that differentiating mere colonization from etiologic pathogens infecting the lower respiratory tract is best achieved by employing bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) or protected specimen brush (psb) in combination with quantitative culture and detection of intracellular microorganisms. endotracheal aspirate and non-bronchoscopic bal/psb in combination with quantitative culture provide a good alternative in patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia. since culture results take 2-3 days, initial therapy of hap is by definition empirical. epidemiologic studies have identified the most frequently involved pathogens: enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus ('core pathogens'). empirical therapy covering only the 'core pathogens' will suffice in patients without risk factors for resistant microorganisms. studies that have appeared since the ats statement issued in 1996, demonstrate several new risk factors for hap with multiresistant pathogens. in patients with risk factors, empirical therapy should consist of antibacterials with a broader spectrum. the most important risk factors for resistant microorganisms are late onset of hap (>/=5 days after admission), recent use of antibacterial therapy, and mechanical  ventilation. multiresistant bacteria of specific interest are methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae. each of these organisms has its specific susceptibility pattern, demanding appropriate antibacterial treatment. to further improve outcomes, specific therapeutic options for multiresistant pathogens and pharmacological factors are discussed. antibacterials developed since 1996 or antibacterials with renewed interest (linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, meropenem, new fluoroquinolones, and fourth-generation cephalosporins) are discussed in the light of developing resistance.since the ats statement, many reports have shown increasing incidences of resistant microorganisms. therefore, one of the most important conclusions from this review is that empirical therapy for hap should not be based on general guidelines alone, but that local epidemiology should be taken into account and used in the formulation of local guidelines.

TI  == in vitro activities of tigecycline against clinical isolates from shanghai, china.
AB  == to evaluate the in vitro activity of tigecycline, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of tigecycline against 1,201 strains of recent clinical isolates from 10 hospitals in shanghai, china were determined and compared with selected comparators. results showed that tigecycline had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. it was highly active against gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., penicillin-intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. tigecycline also  had good activity against most strains of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and moraxella catarrhalis. however, it was poorly active against acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. tigecycline was highly active against anaerobic gram-positive cocci such as peptococcus spp. the in vitro activity of tigecycline was significantly better than that of minocycline and tetracycline. it was as active as or slightly more active than vancomycin and teicoplanin in the activity against resistant aerobic  gram-positive cocci. tigecycline was bactericidal against all gram-positive cocci tested except enterococcus spp. inoculum size but not ph of medium or concentration of human serum in broth had significant effect on the in vitro activity of tigecycline. aged media (48-72 hours after preparation) used in the test and specific resistance problem in china may have some effects on mic values of tigecycline.

TI  == [surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: vira study 2004].
AB  == introduction: the objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the vira study carried out in 2001.  methods: the 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in february 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium (89) and enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli (346), pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and acinetobacter baumannii (130). the hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. results: the number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). global methicillin-resistance in s. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the e. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. one p. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the e-test mbl assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. the strains of imipenem-resistant a. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. conclusion: these results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. this emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use  of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia in infants after cardiac surgery.
AB  == background: the pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (np) in infants in a pediatric surgical icu after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult icus. study objectives: the primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of np  in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. methods: data were collected between june 1999 and june 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. we retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. results: of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired np after cardiac surgery. the incidence of np was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (chd) compared to simple chd (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). the proportion of late-onset np was higher in patients with complex chd (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). a total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. gram-negative bacilli (gnb) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). the main gnb were acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen gnb were flavobacterium meningosepticum (7  isolates, 8.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). the most commonly seen gram-positive cocci were staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). the frequent fungi were candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). most gnb were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. the bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from k pneumoniae and e coli; the susceptibility of esbl-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. there were one case of methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant s epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. from 1999 to 2002 in infants with np after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant gnb such as a baumanii, p aeruginosa, and k pneumoniae. however, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. early onset episodes of np were frequently caused by haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive s aureus, and other susceptible enterobacteriaceae. conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset np, p aeruginosa, a baumannii, other multiresistant gnb, mrsa, and fungi were the predominant organisms. conclusions: the pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in np in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of gram-positive pathogens as reported by several  adult icus. gnb still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years  in our hospital. there was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.

AB  == objective: to classify infections according to the carrier state determined by surveillance cultures of throat and rectum, rather than by the traditional criterion of the time of onset after admission. methods: an observational cohort  study of 3 months' duration was performed in a mixed medical---surgical intensive care unit (icu) in a district general hospital of a subset of patients requiring  mechanical ventilation for 3 days. surveillance cultures from throat and rectum were obtained on admission to the icu and then twice weekly to distinguish carriage of potentially pathogenic microorganisms (ppm) brought in by the patient from microorganisms acquired during the icu stay. results: out of the total population of 104 patients, 21 patients were enrolled over 3 months. eight patients (38%) developed 12 infections, half of which were of primary endogenous  pathogenesis and caused by haemophilus influenzae, candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa carried by the patients on admission. the remaining six were of secondary endogenous pathogenesis and caused by acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa acquired in the unit. conclusions: traditional classifications of hospital infection are challenged. if the traditional 48-h cut-off point was used, then 9 of 12 cases (75%) of infection would have been classified as nosocomial, whereas using the method based on the carrier state, 50% of all infections were caused by microorganisms carried by the patient on admission to the icu. moreover, we believe that the distinction between primary endogenous, secondary endogenous and exogenous is valid because these three types of infection each require different control methods.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in china.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. a total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. the mic of cefpiramide for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). fifty-one percent (26/51) of enterobacter cloacae  isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against e. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. cefpiramide was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. cefpiramide-resistant p. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant s. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 2 microg/ml). against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an mic90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. these results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylo-coccus aureus, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae. thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the ddc homolog encoding l-2,4-diaminobutyrate decarboxylase in enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == l-2,4-diaminobutyrate decarboxylase (daba dc) catalyzes the formation of 1,3-diaminopropane (dap) from daba. in the present study, the ddc gene encoding daba dc from enterobacter aerogenes atcc 13048 was cloned and characterized. determination of the nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 1470 bp encoding a 53659-da protein of 490 amino acids, whose deduced nh2-terminal sequence was identical to that of purified daba dc from e. aerogenes. the deduced amino acid sequence was highly similar to those of acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae daba dcs encoded by the ddc genes. the lysine-307 of the e. aerogenes daba dc was identified as the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate binding residue by site-directed mutagenesis. furthermore, pcr analysis revealed the distribution of e. aerogenes ddc homologs in some other species of enterobacteriaceae. such a  relatively wide occurrence of the ddc homologs implies biological significance of daba dc and its product dap.

TI  == high prevalence of antibiotic resistance of common pathogenic bacteria in taiwan. the antibiotic resistance study group of the infectious disease society of the republic of china.
AB  == we analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibilities of all clinical isolates of 14 common pathogenic bacteria recovered from patients in eight medical centers in taiwan during 1995 and 1996. susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents was tested by the disk diffusion method as recommended by the national committee  for clinical laboratory standards. of the staphylococcus aureus isolates, 59.3% and 62% were oxacillin-resistant in 1995 and 1996, respectively, whereas 63.2% of the coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates during the study period were oxacillin-resistant. the rate of penicillin-resistance among streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was 39.7% in 1995 and 53.7% in 1996. macrolide-resistance was found in 71.4%, 42.1%, and 46.7% of s. pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans streptococci, respectively, in 1996. less than 2% of the enterococcal isolates were vancomycin resistant, but 77% of them were gentamicin  resistant. resistance to gentamicin was also common in enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. various degrees of resistance to ampicillin, piperacillin, cephalosporins, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin were detected in enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa, and a. baumannii. more than 55% of haemophilus influenzae isolates were ampicillin resistant. in summary, resistance to many antimicrobial agents in various common  pathogenic bacteria is very common in taiwan. our results implicate that antibiotic resistance in the developing countries need to be monitored closely.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of levofloxacin against hospital isolates: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of the fluoroquinolone,  levofloxacin, against hospital isolates of bacteria. mics of levofloxacin were determined for 2154 strains by agar dilution. breakpoints for susceptibility testing were calculated using the agar diffusion technique with 5 micrograms discs. the activity of levofloxacin against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible enterobacteriaceae (n = 668) was higher (mic50/90 0.06-0.12 mg/l) than previously reported for ofloxacin. as seen with other fluoroquinolones, this activity was reduced against nalidixic acid-resistant and  pefloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains (mic 1-8 mg/l). mics for pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 104) were between 0.12 and 128 mg/l. levofloxacin had good activity against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible acinetobacter baumannii (n = 12; mic 0.06-0.25 mg/l), but the activity was reduced against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-resistant strains (n = 80; mic 1-32 mg/l). haemophilus influenzae (n = 70), haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 47) and moraxella catarrhalis (n = 64) were inhibited by low concentrations of levofloxacin (mics 0.016-0.03 mg/l, 0.03-0.12 mg/l) and 0.03-0.12 mg/l, respectively). clostridium perfringens (n = 23; mic 0.25-1 mg/l) was more susceptible than bacteroides fragilis (n = 60; mic 0.5-4 mg/l). levofloxacin showed superior activity compared with ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci (n = 107; mic 0.03-0.5 mg/l); the resistant strains (mics 2-32 mg/l) were usually also resistant to methicillin. levofloxacin was less effective against enterococci (n = 105; mic 1-32 mg/l), but streptococci (n = 192) and pneumococci (n = 129), including 58 penicillin-non-susceptible strains, were inhibited by low concentrations (mics 0.5-2 mg/l). according to the regression curve, zone diameters were usually 20-22 mm, 17-19 mm and 15-16 mm for mics of 1, 2 and 4 mg/l, respectively. in conclusion, this study, performed on a large number of strains, confirms the superior anti-bacterial activity of levofloxacin  compared with ofloxacin, especially against pathogens isolated from respiratory tract infections.

TI  == the global epidemiology of resistance to ciprofloxacin and the changing nature of antibiotic resistance: a 10 year perspective.
AB  == many studies have examined the in-vitro activity of ciprofloxacin. the results are for the most part encouraging but we must guard against complacency. levels of ciprofloxacin resistance vary geographically, while some predictably difficult-to-treat organisms such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter baumannii present challenges globally. the emergence of  resistance in species previously exquisitely sensitive to ciprofloxacin, such as  neisseria gonorrhoeae, in countries associated with 'pirate' production and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials represents a major challenge. ciprofloxacin  continues to show excellent activity against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catharralis. in general, ciprofloxacin shows good activity against enterobacteriaceae although the emergence of reduced susceptibility and, sometimes, quinolone resistance in multi-resistant isolates should be noted.

TI  == korean nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of bacteria in 1997.
AB  == antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are known to be prevalent in tertiary-care hospitals in korea. twenty hospitals participated to this surveillance to determine the nationwide prevalence of resistance bacteria in 1997. seven per cent and 26% of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were resistant to 3rd-generation cephalosporin. increased resistance rates, 19% of acinetobacter baumannii to ampicillin/sulbactam, and 17% of pseudomonas aeruginoa to imipenem,  were noted. the resistance rate to fluoroquinolone rose to 24% in e. coli, 56% in a. baumannii and 42% in p. aeruginosa. mean resistance rates were similar in all  hospital groups: about 17% of p. aeruginosa to imipenem, 50% of haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin, 70% of staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, and 70% of pneumococci to penicillin. in conclusion, nosocomial pathogens and problem resistant organisms are prevalent in smaller hospitals too, indicating nosocomial spread is a significant cause of the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria  in korea.

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

AB  == the action of piperacillin-tazobactam on 4,137 of the 4,364 strains collected in  a spanish multicenter study involving 46 participating hospitals was studied. the samples were from the following: 41% urine, 18% exuded from wound abscesses, 13%  respiratory, 9% blood, 3% peritoneal liquid, and the remainder from other various sources. the gram-negative bacteria included 2,778 strains from 13 genera: escherichia (1,289), pseudomonas (451), proteus (230), klebsiella (203), haemophilus (172), enterobacter (145), acinetobacter (88), salmonella (60), bacteroides (57), morganella (53), serratia (46), citrobacter (46), stenotrophonomas (23) and moraxella (21). the gram-positive bacteria were s. aureus (316), e. faecalis (239), s. epidermis (130), s. pneumoniae (115) and clostridium spp. (12). the global susceptibility of the gram-negatives to piperacillin-tazobactam was 94%: e. coli 98%, p. aeruginosa 92%, and p. mirabilis, morganella, k. pneumoniae, serratia and salmonella spp. all greater than 94%. the susceptibility of other bacteria was as follows: 91% citrobacter, 77% e. cloacae, 42% a. baumannii, 61% s. maltophilia, 97% e. faecalis, 93% s. epidermidis, 100% m. catarrhalis, 99% h. influenzae and 100% anaerobic bacteria.  the action on s. pneumoniae and s. aureus varied according to the susceptibility  or lack there of to penicillin or methicillin. in comparison to other antibiotics (piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem and ciprofloxacin), piperacillin-tazobactam was far better than piperacillin alone and better or similar to the others.

AB  == we retrospectively reviewed the variation of the organisms recovered from 403 protected bronchopulmonary specimens in three surgical intensive care units according to the time elapsed from admission. the predominant pathogens during the four first days were haemophilus influenzae (33.3%), staphylococcus aureus (18.2%), mostly methicillin susceptible strains, and streptococcus pneumoniae (14.3%). after the fourth day, they were progressively replaced by typical nosocomial bacteria such as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. for pseudomonas aeruginosa and cephalosporinase-producing enterobacteriaceae, strains resistant to third generation cephalosporins occurred significantly later than the susceptible strains. these results indicate that the time elapsed from intensive care unit admission has a major influence on the bacteriology of respiratory tract infections, but no clear cut-off point between early-onset and late onset pneumonia is evident.

(2) although all patients were colonized, the infection rate was lower after tracheotomy. this may be due to enhanced immunity (medically stable) and improved tracheobronchial toilet. (3) microorganisms in children with tracheotomy differ from those in adults.

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.

AB  == mics of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin for 852 recent clinical isolates were determined by broth microdilution methods. frequency distribution curves, scattergrams, and regression analyses were used to compare in vitro activities and describe cross-resistance. clarithromycin was the most active drug against bacteroides spp. but the least active against haemophilus influenzae. azithromycin was most active against h. influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pasteurella multocida, and fusobacterium spp. but the least active against streptococcus spp. and enterococcus spp. all three drugs had equivalent activities against staphylococcus spp. and gram-positive anaerobes. none of the three drugs was particularly active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae or nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, although concentrations of 4 micrograms of azithromycin per ml inhibited some strains of the family enterobacteriaceae (particularly escherichia coli and citrobacter diversus) and acinetobacter baumannii. although relative drug activities varied by organism, organisms relatively susceptible to one were relatively susceptible  to all and organisms relatively resistant to one were relatively resistant to all; an exception was fusobacteria, which were usually susceptible only to azithromycin. cross-susceptibility and cross-resistance were, therefore, the rule (except for fusobacterium spp.), although the percentage of susceptible organisms could be varied considerably on the basis of the selection of breakpoints.

AB  == the aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin ru 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester hr 916. ru 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. against methicillin-sensitive staphylococci ru 29 246 (mic90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. ru 29 246 inhibited hemolytic streptococci of the serogroups a, b, c and g as well as penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (mic90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). mic90s of ru 29 246 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella spp., shigella spp.,  proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. only ru 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). most strains of pseudomonas spp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., hafnia alvei and bacteroides spp. were resistant to ru 29 246. ru 29 246 killed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times mic. the ph value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of ru 29 246. ru 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.
