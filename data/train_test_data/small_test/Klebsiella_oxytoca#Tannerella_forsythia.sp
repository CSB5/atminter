TI  == changes in the subgingival microbiota and periodontal parameters before and 3 months after bracket placement.
AB  == introduction: dental plaque is organized in a biofilm complex that provides protection and nutrients for periodontopathic bacteria. several factors can affect microbial colonization, including restorations and orthodontic brackets. the aim of this study was to investigate changes in subgingival microbiota and clinical parameters before and after bracket placement. methods: clinical parameters and subgingival microbial samples were collected from 30 patients before and after bracket placement. thirty additional patients with no orthodontic treatment served as controls. samples were cultured and analyzed for  periodontopathic and superinfecting bacteria. a descriptive analysis was conducted, and chi-square, student t, wilcoxon matched, and mann whitney rank sum tests were used to test for differences between groups (p < or=.05). results: no  changes in probing depth or clinical attachment level were observed, but scores for bleeding on probing, plaque index, and gingival index increased after bracket placement (p < or =.05). porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium species were elevated in the experimental group after bracket placement compared with the control group (p < or =.01). superinfecting microorganisms such as enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens were  also found. conclusions: bracket placement influences the accumulation of plaque  and the colonization of important periodontopathic and superinfecting bacteria, resulting in more inflammation and bleeding. special attention should be paid to  oral hygiene methods in orthodontic patients.
