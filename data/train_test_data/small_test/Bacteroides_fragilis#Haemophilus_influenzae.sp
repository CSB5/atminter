TI  == microbiology of acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis in smokers and nonsmokers.
AB  == objectives: we evaluated the microbiology of sinus aspirates of smokers and nonsmokers with acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis. methods: cultures were obtained from 458 patients, 244 (87 smokers and 157 nonsmokers) of whom had acute maxillary sinusitis and 214 (84 smokers and 130 nonsmokers) of whom had chronic maxillary sinusitis, between 2001 and 2007. results: a greater number of staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa), and beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (blpb) were found in the 87 smokers with acute  sinusitis than in the nonsmokers with acute sinusitis (p < 0.005, p < 0.025, and  p < 0.05, respectively). a greater number of these organisms were found in the 84 smokers with chronic sinusitis than in the nonsmokers (p < 0.01, p < 0.025, and p < 0.001, respectively). eighty-five blpb isolates were recovered from 73 patients (30%) with acute sinusitis. these included moraxella catarrhalis, s aureus, haemophilus influenzae, prevotella spp, and fusobacterium spp; 40 blpb isolates were found in smokers, and 45 in nonsmokers (p < 0.05). one hundred twenty-five blpb isolates were recovered from 91 patients (43%) with chronic sinusitis, including m catarrhalis, bacteroides fragilis group, s aureus, h influenzae, prevotella spp, and fusobacterium spp; 69 blpb isolates were found in smokers, and 56 in nonsmokers (p < 0.001). antimicrobial therapy had been administered in  the past month to 130 patients (28%; 60 smokers and 70 nonsmokers; p <0.025). both mrsa and blpb were isolated more often from these individuals (p < 0.025). however, the higher isolation rates of mrsa and blpb in smokers were independent  of previous antimicrobial therapy. conclusions: these data illustrate a greater frequency of isolation of s aureus, mrsa, and blpb in patients with acute and chronic sinusitis who smoke.

TI  == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2009].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 2655 strains including 810 strains of gram-positive  bacteria, 1635 strains of gram-negative bacteria, and 210 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2009 was examined. the results were as follows; (1) mepm was more active than the other carbapenem antibiotics tested against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae. mepm was also active against most  of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multidrug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). (2) mepm maintained potent and stable antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the proportion of mepm-resistant strains to ciprofloxacin-resistant strains or imipenem-resistant strains were 53.1% and 58.0% respectively. (3) the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 3.1% (26 strains) in enterobacteriaceae. and the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 2.0% (6 strains) in p. aeruginosa. (4) of all  species tested, there were no species except for bacteroides fragilis group, which mic90 of mepm was more than 4-fold higher than those in our previous study. therefore, there is almost no significant decrease in susceptibility of clinical  isolates to meropenem. in conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem for serious infections treatment at present, 14 years passed after available for commercial use in japan.

TI  == bsac standardized disc susceptibility testing method (version 8).
AB  == there have been considerable changes to the format of the recommendations since the previous version (version 7). the majority of the footnotes to the tables have been removed and the notations added to the end column; it is hoped that this change will avoid confusion in interpretation. antibiotics have been separated into groups, e.g. beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, etc. recommendations for urinary tract infections (utis) have been removed for most agents except for  those that are administered solely for the treatment of uncomplicated utis or where there are limited recommendations for specific organisms, e.g. trimethoprim. for agents that previously had dual recommendations, systemic recommendations remain and the intermediate category can be used for interpretation for utis because intermediate susceptibility infers that the infection may respond as the agent is concentrated at the site of infection. this change will also avoid errors in interpretation when an organism is isolated from multiple sites, e.g. blood and urine. the changes that have been made to version  7 are as follows: mic and zone diameter breakpoints (bps) for trimethoprim, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin for utis (table 7); mic and zone diameter breakpoints (bps) for doripenem (tables 7-9); colistin mic bps for pseudomonas spp. (table 9), co-trimoxazole mic bps for stenotrophomonas maltophilia (table 10); staphylococci mic and zone diameter bps for clarithromycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, trimethoprim uti, nitrofurantoin uti and rifampicin (table 11); streptococcus pneumoniae mic and zone diameter bps for azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, co-trimoxazole, linezolid, rifampicin and telithromycin (table 12); addition of streptomycin recommendations for enterococci (table 13); enterococcal mic and zone diameter bps for quinupristin/dalfopristin, nitrofurantoin uti and trimethoprim uti (table 13); beta-haemolytic streptococci mic and zone diameter bps for azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin and telithromycin (table 15); clarithromycin and erythromycin mic and zone diameter bps for moraxella catarrhalis (table 16); azithromycin mic bps for neisseria gonorrhoeae (table 17); chloramphenicol and rifampicin mic bps for neisseria meningitidis (table 18); azithromycin mic bps for haemophilus influenzae (table 19); mic bps for metronidazole for bacteroides  fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and clostridium perfringens (tables 23-25, respectively); susceptibility testing of listeria spp. (appendix 3); the acceptable range for atcc 25923 to a 10 microg tobramycin disc (table 26).

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of dc-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == dc-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. dc-159a showed activity against streptococcus spp. (mic(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. the mic 90s of dc-159a against staphylococcus  spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the mic 90 of dc-159a was 8 microg/ml. dc-159a was the most active against enterococcus spp. (mic 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml)  and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of dc-159a against mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. the mics of dc-159a against chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and dc-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against peptostreptococcus spp., clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. dc-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, dc-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. the bactericidal activity of dc-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. these activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with dc-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16srrna genes pcr amplification and genechip hybridization].
AB  == objective: to explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  methods: (1) the primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16srrna gene. the gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. the gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, gram positive bacterial probe, gram negative bacterial probe 1, gram negative bacterial probe 2, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) 1, cons 2, escherichia coli, hemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus, meningococcus, corynebacterium, propionibacterium; (2) blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16s rrna gene was detected separately; dna isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by pcr, and pcr products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. results: (1) of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by pcr and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (p < 0.01). when blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of pcr was 100% and specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) the 17 specimens which showed positive results by pcr were further hybridized on the gene chip. all were positive by universal probes. among all of them, 5 were positive by e. coli probe; 4 were positive by staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by bacillus and propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by cons. the 8 specimens which showed positive results by both pcr and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. conclusion: detection of the bacterial 16srrna genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia  rapidly. this method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical  in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems and carbapenems. a total of 3,245 strains in 32 species of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabillis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp. (p. alcalifaciens, p. rettgeri, p. stuartii), pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, acinetobactor baumannii, acinetobactor lwoffii, bacteroides fragilis  group (b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron),  and prevotella spp. (p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. bivia, p. oralis, p. denticola). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, c. freundii, c. koseri, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, s. marcescens, p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, providencia spp., p. aeruginosa, and a. lwoffii throughout 6 years. the mic90 of  czop against those strains were consistent with those obtained from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. on the other hand, the mic90 of czop against h. influenzae yearly obviously increased with approximately 64-time difference during the study period. the mic90 of cefpirome, cefepime, and flomoxef against h. influenzae also yearly tended to rise. the present results demonstrated that czop had maintained the antibacterial activity against almost gram-negative strains tested. however, the decrease in antibacterial activities of czop against b. cepacia, and h. influenzae was suggested.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the c-2 side chain. in agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) with a mic(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. furthermore, sm-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against mrsa, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the mic. sm-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of mrsa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. the mics of sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. these drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against enterococcus faecium, and the mic(90) s for ampicillin-resistant e. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. however, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity  of sm-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an e. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in cfu at four times the mic after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. in addition, sm-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the e. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the mics (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus spp. thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

TI  == joint and bone infections due to anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  == the current review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria in children. staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae type-b, and group a streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae, kingela kingae, neisseria meningiditis and salmonella spp are the predominant aerobic bacteria that cause arthritis in children. gonococcal arthritis can occur in sexually active adolescents. the predominant aerobes causing osteomyelitis in children are s. aureus, h. influenzae type-b, gram-negative enteric bacteria, beta-hemolytic streptococci, s. pneumoniae, k. kingae, bartonella henselae and borrelia burgdorferi. anaerobes have rarely been  reported as a cause of these infections in children. the main anaerobes in arthritis include anaerobic gram negative bacilli including bacteroides fragilis  group, fusobacterium spp., clostridium spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. most of the cases of anaerobic arthritis, in contrast to anaerobic osteomyelitis, involved a single isolate. most of the cases of anaerobic arthritis are secondary to hematogenous spread. many patients with osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria have evidence of anaerobic infection elsewhere in the body, which is the source of the organisms involved in osteomyelitis. treatment of arthritis and osteomyelitis involving anaerobic bacteria includes symptomatic therapy, immobilization in some cases, adequate drainage of purulent material and antibiotic therapy effective to these organisms.

TI  == cefditoren, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin.
AB  == cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the food and drug administration in september 2001. it has been used in japan for several years. the greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus.  nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and legionella sp. moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit pseudomonas aeruginosa or bacteroides fragilis. in virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == pharmacodynamic properties of hmr 3004, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  == objective: the pharmacodynamic properties of the novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide) antibiotic, hmr 3004, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. methods: the time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and bacteroides fragilis. the postantibiotic effects of hmr 3004 were also investigated on these organisms  at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x mic. results: the time kill-kinetic data demonstrated that hmr 3004 is inoculum dependent and predominantly bacteriostatic being only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. hmr 3004  exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect with all strains studied, ranging from 1.9--6.2 h at 10 x mic. conclusions: the bacteriostatic activity and significant postantibiotic effect demonstrated by hmr 3004 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial spectrum of a new broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial spectrum of gatifloxacin was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent than  comparator quinolones against staphylococci, streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci (gatifloxacin mic90s, < or =1 mg/l, except 4 mg/l against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium). gatifloxacin was two-fold less potent than ciprofloxacin, and the same as or two-fold more potent than ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae (mic90s, 0.06-0.5  mg/l against most members of the enterobacteriaceae and < or =1 mg/l against proteus/morganella spp.). relative to the comparator quinolones, gatifloxacin was two- to four-fold more potent against providencia spp., and had good potency against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.25-1 mg/l). gatifloxacin and ofloxacin had  similar anti-pseudomonal potency, with corresponding mic90s of 4, 8 and 0.25 mg/l for pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens and pseudomonas stutzeri, while ciprofloxacin had two- to eight-fold more potency. the three quinolones were equipotent against burkholderia cepacia (mic90s, 8 mg/l), but gatifloxacin was two-fold more potent against stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic90, 4 mg/l). gatifloxacin was highly potent (mic90s, 0.03-0.06 mg/l) against haemophilus influenzae, legionella spp., helicobacter pylori and had at least eight-fold better anti-chlamydial and anti-mycoplasma potency (gatifloxacin mic90s, 0.13 mg/l). the higher quinolone mics for ureaplasma (mic90s, 4-8 mg/l) may be due to  the acidic ph of the ureaplasma test medium, which antagonizes quinolones. like other quinolones, gatifloxacin had poor potency against mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, though it was eight- to 16-fold more potent against mycobacterium tuberculosis (mic90, 0.25 mg/l). of the three quinolones, only gatifloxacin had activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridium difficile. in summary, gatifloxacin is a broad-spectrum 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that is more potent than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria, chlamydia, mycoplasma, mycobacteria and anaerobes.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activity of levofloxacin against hospital isolates: a multicentre study.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of the fluoroquinolone,  levofloxacin, against hospital isolates of bacteria. mics of levofloxacin were determined for 2154 strains by agar dilution. breakpoints for susceptibility testing were calculated using the agar diffusion technique with 5 micrograms discs. the activity of levofloxacin against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible enterobacteriaceae (n = 668) was higher (mic50/90 0.06-0.12 mg/l) than previously reported for ofloxacin. as seen with other fluoroquinolones, this activity was reduced against nalidixic acid-resistant and  pefloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains (mic 1-8 mg/l). mics for pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 104) were between 0.12 and 128 mg/l. levofloxacin had good activity against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible acinetobacter baumannii (n = 12; mic 0.06-0.25 mg/l), but the activity was reduced against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-resistant strains (n = 80; mic 1-32 mg/l). haemophilus influenzae (n = 70), haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 47) and moraxella catarrhalis (n = 64) were inhibited by low concentrations of levofloxacin (mics 0.016-0.03 mg/l, 0.03-0.12 mg/l) and 0.03-0.12 mg/l, respectively). clostridium perfringens (n = 23; mic 0.25-1 mg/l) was more susceptible than bacteroides fragilis (n = 60; mic 0.5-4 mg/l). levofloxacin showed superior activity compared with ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible  staphylococci (n = 107; mic 0.03-0.5 mg/l); the resistant strains (mics 2-32 mg/l) were usually also resistant to methicillin. levofloxacin was less effective against enterococci (n = 105; mic 1-32 mg/l), but streptococci (n = 192) and pneumococci (n = 129), including 58 penicillin-non-susceptible strains, were inhibited by low concentrations (mics 0.5-2 mg/l). according to the regression curve, zone diameters were usually 20-22 mm, 17-19 mm and 15-16 mm for mics of 1, 2 and 4 mg/l, respectively. in conclusion, this study, performed on a large number of strains, confirms the superior anti-bacterial activity of levofloxacin  compared with ofloxacin, especially against pathogens isolated from respiratory tract infections.

(5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == the periplasmic, group iii catalase of vibrio fischeri is required for normal symbiotic competence and is induced both by oxidative stress and by approach to stationary phase.
AB  == the catalase gene, kata, of the sepiolid squid symbiont vibrio fischeri has been  cloned and sequenced. the predicted amino acid sequence of kata has a high degree of similarity to the recently defined group iii catalases, including those found  in haemophilus influenzae, bacteroides fragilis, and proteus mirabilis. upstream  of the predicted start codon of kata is a sequence that closely matches the consensus sequence for promoters regulated in escherichia coli by the alternative sigma factor encoded by rpos. further, the level of expression of the cloned kata gene in an e. coli rpos mutant is much lower than in wild-type e. coli. catalase  activity is induced three- to fourfold both as growing v. fischeri cells approach stationary phase and upon the addition of a small amount of hydrogen peroxide during logarithmic growth. the catalase activity was localized in the periplasm of wild-type v. fischeri cells, where its role could be to detoxify hydrogen peroxide coming from the external environment. no significant catalase activity could be detected in a kata null mutant strain, demonstrating that kata is the predominately expressed catalase in v. fischeri and indicating that v. fischeri carries only a single catalase gene. the catalase mutant was defective in its ability to competitively colonize the light organs of juvenile squids in coinoculation experiments with the parent strain, suggesting that the catalase enzyme plays an important role in the symbiosis between v. fischeri and its squid host.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

TI  == bacteriological evaluation of 194 adult patients with acute frontal sinusitis and findings of simultaneous maxillary sinusitis.
AB  == in a prospective study bacteriological findings from frontal and maxillary sinus  secretes were analyzed. frontal sinus trephination was performed to 103 and maxillary irrigation to 192 patients. main pathogens in the frontal as well as in the maxillary sinus secretes were haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae. beta-lactamase production of h. influenzae was found in 17% of frontal and in 16% of maxillary sinus samples. bacteriological findings were supported by the staining results. the portion of anaerobic pathogens in cultures were poor, though bacteroides fragilis antigen was detected in 8 frontal and 6 maxillary sinus samples. the acute frontal sinusitis should be treated with respective antibiotics. complications seem not to develop in the acute phase and  the disease can primarily be treated conservatively. it should however be controlled properly to avoid prolonged disease and late complications.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem, was studied in comparison with other beta-lactam antimicrobials against 711 recent clinical isolates including gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. mic data showed that faropenem was active against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (mics <  or = 4 mg/l), with reduced activity against serratia spp. (mic90 = 32 mg/l). in common with its comparators, faropenem had weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic > 128 mg/l). faropenem was active against staphylococci, although for mrsa mics were raised (mic90 = 2 mg/l) compared with those for mssa (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l). faropenem was also found to be  active against streptococci, neisseria spp., enterococcus faecalis and beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and  moraxella catarrhalis. of the anaerobic bacteria studied, faropenem was most active against peptostreptococci and clostridium perfringens (mic90 < or = 1 mg/l) and bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 4 mg/l). an increase in inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu raised faropenem mics for morganella morganii from 0.06-1 mg/l to 2-4 mg/l and for mrsa from 0.25-2 mg/l to 8 mg/l (a similar increase was not observed for mssa). the mics of faropenem were not affected by the presence of either 20% or 70% (v/v) serum. mics for faropenem to 11 well characterized beta-lactamase producers were similar to those of non-producers. in hydrolysis studies, faropenem was shown to be highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases,  including tem-1, shv-1, the extended spectrum beta-lactamases, tem-3 and tem-9, and the beta-lactamase produced by staphylococcus aureus (nctc 11561).

TI  == cloning and genetic characterization of helicobacter pylori catalase and construction of a catalase-deficient mutant strain.
AB  == the n-terminal sequence of a protein, originally described as an adhesin of helicobacter pylori, was used in an oligonucleotide-based screening procedure of  an h. pylori plasmid library in escherichia coli. five independent plasmid clones were isolated, all mapping to the same chromosomal region and encoding the h. pylori catalase. the gene, designated kata, comprises 1,518 nucleotides and encodes a putative protein of 505 amino acids with a predicted mr of 58,599. a second open reading frame, orf2, encoding a putative 32,715-da protein of unknown function, follows kata. the transcriptional start site of kata mrna was determined, but no typical consensus promoter sequence was present. a potential binding site for the fur protein is located upstream of kata. when introduced into the catalase-deficient e. coli double-mutant um255, the cloned gene readily  complemented e. coli for catalase activity. h. pylori kata is highly homologous to catalases in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with the highest homology being  shown to bordetella pertussis (64.9%), bacteroides fragilis (59.8%), and haemophilus influenzae (57.9%) catalases. transposon insertion mutants were generated in three independent h. pylori strains by tnmax5-mediated transposon shuttle mutagenesis. in contrast to the wild-type strains, no significant catalase-specific enzymatic activity could be detected in the mutant strains, consistent with the fact that no additional kata-homologous gene copies were found in the h. pylori chromosome. no significant difference between wild-type and mutant strains for binding to epithelial cells was apparent, suggesting that  kata is not involved in h. pylori adhesion. the cloning and genetic characterization of kata are essential steps for further investigation of the role of catalase in the defense of h. pylori against oxygen-dependent killing mechanisms by polymorphonuclear granulocytes, a process not well understood for this chronically persisting pathogen.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in  our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december  of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the  range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp.  and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus  spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == an evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the tem and shv types found in escherichia coli and klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as bacteroides species. its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, tem and shv beta-lactamase producing gram negative bacteria and anerobes. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with mic values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. mics were determined by agar dilution (nccls 1990 and 1992). piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. it was also active against the majority of enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. it was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing klebsiella species and some high level tem and shv beta-lactamase producing e. coli and klebsiella species. activity against gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. however some enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these class i beta lactamases. activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for gram negative rods. imipenem was the most active agent against esbl producing klebsiella species. piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide gram positive as well as gram negative cover of  febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.

AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble cd14.
AB  == in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. lps-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte lps receptor, scd14. we evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial e-selectin and tissue factor expression through scd14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huve). both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, and klebsiella pneumoniae) but not  viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent e-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. tissue factor activity  on huve, indicated by factor x activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in huve, indicated by the appearance of e-selectin-specific mrna and by the demonstration of activation of nf-kappa b, a trans-activating factor necessary for e-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. in contrast, neither e-selectin mrna nor activation of nf-kappa b was detected in huve treated with gram-positive bacteria. endothelial  cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against cd14. furthermore, cho-k1 cells, transfected with human recombinant cd14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by cho-k1 nf-kappa b activation. we conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common scd14-dependent pathway.

TI  == biochemical and genetic analyses of a catalase from the anaerobic bacterium bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == a single catalase enzyme was produced by the anaerobic bacterium bacteroides fragilis when cultures at late log phase were shifted to aerobic conditions. in anaerobic conditions, catalase activity was detected in stationary-phase cultures, indicating that not only oxygen exposure but also starvation may affect the production of this antioxidant enzyme. the purified enzyme showed a peroxidatic activity when pyrogallol was used as an electron donor. it is a hemoprotein containing one heme molecule per holomer and has an estimated molecular weight of 124,000 to 130,000. the catalase gene was cloned by screening a b. fragilis library for complementation of catalase activity in an escherichia  coli catalase mutant (kate katg) strain. the cloned gene, designated katb, encoded a catalase enzyme with electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the  purified protein from the b. fragilis parental strain. the nucleotide sequence of katb revealed a 1,461-bp open reading frame for a protein with 486 amino acids and a predicted molecular weight of 55,905. this result was very close to the 60,000 da determined by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified catalase and indicates that the native enzyme is  composed of two identical subunits. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified catalase obtained by edman degradation confirmed that it is a product of katb. the amino acid sequence of katb showed high similarity to haemophilus influenzae hkte (71.6% identity, 66% nucleotide identity), as well as to gram-positive bacterial and mammalian catalases. no similarities to bacterial catalase-peroxidase-type enzymes were found. the active-site residues, proximal and distal hemebinding ligands, and nadph-binding residues of the bovine liver catalase-type enzyme were highly conserved in b. fragilis katb.

TI  == multicenter clinical laboratory evaluation of a beta-lactamase disk assay employing a novel chromogenic cephalosporin, s1.
AB  == s1, a new chromogenic cephalosporin (international bioclinical, inc., portland, oreg.), was used to detect beta-lactamase production among a variety of commonly  encountered bacteria in a four-center collaborative study. results of an s1 disk  assay were compared with those obtained by a nitrocefin-based disk procedure (cefinase; becton-dickinson microbiology systems, cockeysville, md.), with repetitive testing of five quality control organisms and with individual tests of recent clinical isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae (162 strains), haemophilus influenzae (162 strains), moraxella catarrhalis (155 strains), staphylococcus aureus (161 strains), and bacteroides fragilis (164 strains). the performances of the two beta-lactamase disk assays were comparable for the first three species cited above. however, the s1 assay appeared to be a more sensitive procedure than the cefinase assay when applied to s. aureus and b. fragilis, with respect to both total numbers of positive results and length of time to a definitive positive endpoint.

TI  == development, characterization, and initial evaluations of s1. a new chromogenic cephalosporin for beta-lactamase detection.
AB  == a novel, chromogenic cephalosporin reagent (s1) for beta-lactamase testing was produced that shares physicochemical characteristics with nitrocefin (formerly 87/312). s1 and nitrocefin in a disk-testing format for beta-lactamase performed  at 100% agreement for detecting enzyme-producing isolates of bacteroides fragilis group, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, staphylococcus aureus, and selected enterobacteriaceae. the time required to achieve an initial color change or a strong positive reaction was comparable for  both chromogenic reagents for all organisms except the gram-positive species. s1  reaction times were approximately 50% faster than nitrocefin for beta-lactamase-positive enterococci and s. aureus. these results from the developmental studies and a commercially prepared disk lot indicate that s1 is a  promising beta-lactamase disk test reagent with the ability to detect all significant enzyme-producing species strains, some significantly earlier than the nitrocefin disk method.

TI  == a bacteriologic basis for the evolution and severity of empyema.
AB  == the management of pediatric empyema remains controversial. an experimental study  was undertaken to evaluate the role of bacteria in the evolution and severity of  empyema, using specific bacteria that are pathogens of empyema in children. a rabbit model was used. the groups were haemophilus influenzae (n = 9), bacteroides fragilis (n = 8), the combination (n = 12), staphylococcus aureus (n  = 6), and control (n = 6). the total bacterial inoculum (10(8)) was constant. diagnostic thoracentesis was performed at regular intervals. characteristics of the empyema were evaluated when the rabbits were killed (at 4, 7, and 10 days). most rabbits other than those of the mixed-bacteria group cleared the bacteria from their pleural cavities. eleven of 12 mixed-bacteria animals had multiloculated empyemas; only one resolved spontaneously. in the other groups, the tendency was toward unilocular empyemas, which resolved by the 10th day in one third of the h influenzae animals, two thirds of the bacteroides fragilis animals, and half the s aureus animals. the empyemas that persisted until the 10th day were in the exudative or fibrinopurulent stage, except for those of the  mixed-bacteria group, all of which were in the advanced organizing stage. the amount of pleural debris and the degree of organization were significantly greater for the mixed bacteria group (p > .01). these findings support the clinical management of monobacterial empyema by simple drainage, whereas mixed aerobic-anaerobic empyemas may require more aggressive drainage procedures.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

AB  == cefetamet pivoxil is an oral, third-generation cephalosporin whose broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and favorable pharmacokinetic profile make it particularly suitable for the treatment of a wide range of infectious diseases. cefetamet has high in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that cause a number of respiratory tract and urinary tract infections. these include penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus spp, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus spp., klebsiella spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae. it is not active against staphylococci, enterococci, pseudomonas spp. or bacteroides fragilis but does inhibit most bile-sensitive (oral) bacteroides spp. animal toxicology studies indicate that neither cefetamet pivoxil nor the active compound cefetamet have significant teratogenic, mutagenic, photogenic or allergenic potential. cefetamet is eliminated unchanged in the urine with a half-life of 2.2 h. volume of distribution approximates the extracellular fluid space (0.3 1/kg), protein binding is minima (22%) and oral bioavailability of cefetamet pivoxil is approximately 50% when taken with food. no significant drug interactions have been noted to date. the efficacy and tolerability of cefetamet pivoxil have been  evaluated in the treatment of gram-positive and gram-negative infections in almost 5,000 patients. in comparative studies, cefetamet pivoxil was at least as  effective, and in many cases clinically superior, to most currently recommended antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections including gonorrhea and complicated infections in high risk patients. efficacy has also been demonstrated in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pneumonia and infections of the ear, nose and throat. clinical trials have shown that a 7 day treatment period with cefetamet pivoxil is as effective as a 10 day course of phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of pharyngotonsillitis. cefetamet pivoxil has been well-tolerated in clinical trials with only 1.2% of patients on  standard doses discontinuing therapy prematurely. the most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) which occur in less than 10% of patients. many current antibiotic treatment regimens involve the administration of three or more daily doses. however, standard doses of cefetamet pivoxil 500 mg twice daily provide unbound plasma concentrations of cefetamet which generally exceed the mic(90) for susceptible organisms throughout the dosing interval and have been demonstrated to be clinically effective. this should result in good compliance with therapy in out-patients. dosing regimens for cefetamet pivoxil should be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function while standard doses  can be given to elderly patients and those with liver disease. standard doses in  children are 10 mg/kg or alternatively, children may receive a dose reduced in proportion to the ratio of their body surface area to that of an adult.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of ro 09-1227, a novel catechol-substituted cephalosporin.
AB  == ro 09-1227 is a novel 7-position catechol-substituted parenteral cephalosporin that also has a 3-position radical similar to previously described cephems. the ro 09-1227 spectrum was slightly wider than that of ceftazidime against members of the family enterobacteriaceae tested, principally because of greater activity  against species producing richmond-sykes type i beta-lactamases. ro 09-1227 was also more active than ceftazidime against some strains producing extended-spectrum plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases, such as tem-3, -4, -5, -6, -7, and -9, shv-2 and -3, and caz-2. most strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, xanthomonas maltophilia, and acinetobacter spp. were also more susceptible to ro  09-1227 than cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. haemophilus  influenzae (mic for 90% of strains tested [mic90], 0.5 micrograms/ml), neisseria  gonorrhoeae (mic90, 0.015 micrograms/ml), and moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) were also ro 09-1227 susceptible. ro 09-1227 activity  against important gram-positive cocci was most comparable to that of ceftazidime. bacteroides fragilis (mic90, greater than 32 micrograms/ml) and the enterococci (mic90, greater than 32 micrograms/ml) were resistant to ro 09-1227. these in vitro results indicate that this catechol-substituted cephalosporin may be useful as an empiric agent, especially for some isolates resistant to currently available broad-spectrum cephalosporins.

TI  == transferrins and heme-compounds as iron sources for pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the low concentration of free iron in body fluids creates bacteriostatic conditions for many microorganisms and is therefore an important defense factor of the body against invading bacteria. pathogenic bacteria have developed several mechanisms for acquiring iron from the host. siderophore-mediated iron uptake involves the synthesis of low molecular weight iron chelators called siderophores which compete with the host iron-binding glycoproteins lactoferrin (lf) and transferrin (tf) for iron. other ways to induce iron uptake, without the mediation of siderophores, are the possession of outer membrane protein receptors that actually recognize the complex of tf or lf with iron, resulting in the internalization of this metal, and the use of heme-compounds released into the circulation after lysis of erythrocytes. in this review, the nonsiderophore-mediated iron-uptake systems used by certain pathogenic bacteria are emphasized. the possible contribution of these iron-uptake systems to the virulence of pathogens is also discussed.

AB  == we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1989. the susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and xanthomonas maltophilia. ipm has been found to have activities  superior to those of other antibiotics tested against e. faecalis, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis. no antibiotics tested showed good activities against mrsa except minocycline.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.
AB  == tazobactam (ytr 830), a new beta-lactamase inhibitor, was evaluated for its effect in combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum, but beta-lactamase sensitive, penicillin, against 14 common bacteria. a total of 1,086 clinical isolates from different clinical specimens were tested for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities  to piperacillin alone and in combination with tazobactam in a ratio of 8:1 by the agar dilution method were evaluated. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 14.5% to 100% in these tested species. in general, the beta-lactamase producers were more resistant to piperacillin than the beta-lactamase nonproducers with higher minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). for the beta-lactamase producers, tazobactam decreased the mics of piperacillin prominently in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, salmonella species and bacteroides fragilis, with a 4-fold or greater decrease in mic50, mic90 and the geometric mean of mic. for serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the mics did not change after adding tazobactam. for other species, there was a moderate decrease in mics. we conclude that tazobactam is an effective beta-lactamase inhibitor for increasing the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin against beta-lactamase producing strains of many species of bacteria.

TI  == [beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations for oral administration].
AB  == beta-lactamase inhibitors are compounds which are able to bind many beta-lactamase and to inactivate them irreversibly ("suicide inactivators"). their intrinsic antimicrobial activity is weak. however, in combination with aminopenicillins they exhibit marked synergism both in vitro and in vivo against  many beta-lactamase producing bacterial strains. at the achievable serum and tissue concentrations after oral administration, various aminopenicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations are active against many strains of beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococci. at levels achievable in the  urine, they are also active against many strains of escherichia coli, proteus spp. and klebsiella spp. clinically, they have been shown to be effective in the  treatment of various human infections of the urinary tract, airways, skin, soft tissues, ear and sinuses. mild gastrointestinal disturbances are the most commonly encountered side effects. aminopenicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations may be a suitable therapeutic option in treating mild to moderately  severe infections, i.e. in an outpatient setting.

TI  == in vitro activity evaluations of cefdinir (fk482, ci-983, and pd134393). a novel  orally administered cephalosporin.
AB  == cefdinir, a so-called third-generation oral cephalosporin was tested in vitro against over 700 pathogens from patients with bacteremia. cefdinir was very active against the enterobacteriaceae with a 50% minimum inhibitory concentration (mic50) value range of less than or equal to 0.03-8 micrograms/ml. the enteric species having the highest mic90s (greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml) were citrobacter freundii, and the enterobacters, morganella morganii, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. cefdinir was generally two- to fourfold less active than cefixime, but markedly more potent with a wider spectrum compared with older oral cephalosporins, cefaclor or cefuroxime. in contrast to cefixime,  cefdinir inhibited staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml) and other staphylococci. pneumococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, haemophilus influenzae,  moraxella catarrhalis, and pathogenic neisseria spp. (mic90s, 0.12-0.5 micrograms/ml) were cefdinir susceptible, but pseudomonas aeruginosa, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and bacteroides fragilis gr. strains were resistant. cefdinir was generally bactericidal with a minimal inoculum effect at  10(6) colony-forming units per spot. cefdinir beta-lactamase hydrolysis by some recently described extended broad spectrum beta-lactamases was suspected. cefdinir exhibited a wide, balanced spectrum for an oral cephalosporin indicating possible clinical use against susceptible pathogens in respiratory tract, urinary tract, genital and cutaneous infections.

TI  == a comparison of the in-vitro activity of clarithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, with erythromycin and other oral agents.
AB  == on the basis of minimum inhibitory concentrations clarithromycin (6-o-methylerythromycin), a new macrolide, was found to be slightly more active than erythromycin against staphylococcus aureus, enterococci. moraxella catarrhalis, gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides fragilis (sensu stricto) and b. ureolyticus and slightly less active against coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha- and beta-haemolytic streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter coli/jejuni and the b. melaninogenicus/oralis groups. there was complete cross-resistance between the two agents. reports of potentiation of the activity  against haemophilus influenzae of clarithromycin by its own metabolite and by human serum appear to operate in vivo, and therefore the new agent shows great promise, especially for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == antibacterial activities of amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic  acid correlated with beta-lactamase production.
AB  == amoxicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, was tested for its effect in combination with clavulanic acid, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, against 9 species of bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. a total of 698 strains of bacteria were tested  for beta-lactamase production by the rapid chromogenic cephalosporin method. their susceptibilities to amoxicillin alone and in combination with clavulanic acid were tested by the agar dilution method. the percentage of beta-lactamase producing strains ranged from 46.6% in proteus mirabilis to 100% in klebsiella pneumoniac. in general, beta-lactamase nonproducers were more susceptible to amoxicillin than beta-lactamase producers. for beta-lactamase producers, clavulanic acid decreased the mics of amoxicillin prominently in strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae and bacteroides fragilis, when combining clavulanic acid with amoxicillin in the ratio of 1:2. their mic50s, mic90s and geometric means of mics all decreased 4 folds or greater. for beta-lactamase non-producing strains, the mics did not show significant differences by adding clavulanic acid in most species we tested, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, n. gonorrhoeae, h. influenzae, proteus vulgaris and e. cloacae.

AB  == sparfloxacin (at-4140, ci-978, pd 131501) was tested against over 800 recent bacteremic strains and compared with ciprofloxacin and six other fluoroquinolones. the 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) ranges for the enterobacteriaceae species were (a) sparfloxacin, 0.03-1 microgram/ml and (b) ciprofloxacin, 0.015-0.25 microgram/ml. moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae were very susceptible to sparfloxacin (mic90s, 0.004- less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml) and the other comparison drugs. staphylococcus aureas and other staphylococci were generally susceptible to the tested fluoroquinolones but very susceptible to sparfloxacin and win 57273. all beta-hemolytic streptococci, enterococci, and pneumococci had sparfloxacin mics of less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. sparfloxacin was quite active against anaerobic bacteria including bacteroides fragilis gr. and gram-positive strains (mic90s, less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). the most resistant enteric bacilli were among serratia marcescens and the proteae, especially the providencia spp. (two- to eightfold higher mics). pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were also susceptible to sparfloxacin (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml). magnesium ions, co2 incubation, and low ph had some adverse effect on sparfloxacin mics, and resistance development was documented among current clinical isolates of staphylococci, pseudomonas, and some enteric species.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of e-1040, a novel thiadiazolyl cephalosporin compared with other parenteral cephems.
AB  == e-1040, a new parenteral fourth-generation cephalosporin, was tested against greater than 600 bacteremic pathogens and compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime,  and cefpirome. e-1040 activity against staphylococcus aureus was comparable (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) to ceftazidime, but inferior to cefotaxime (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml) and cefpirome (mic90, 0.5 microgram/ml). beta-hemolytic streptococci and most gram-positive anaerobes were also susceptible to e-1040. some strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci, all oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., enterococci, and bacteroides fragilis group strains were resistant to e-1040 (mic90, greater than 64 micrograms/ml). comparative tests for e-1040 and the three other cephalosporins against pseudomonads and nonenteric gram-negative bacilli showed e-1040 to be generally most active. the e-1040 mic90 for pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1 microgram/ml and for ceftazidime it was 4 micrograms/ml. haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria spp.  has e-1040 mic90s ranging from 0.12 to 2 micrograms/ml. neisseria gonorrhoeae, strains resistant to penicillin, did not have markedly elevated e-1040 mics compared with penicillin-susceptible strains. enterobacteriaceae species had all  mics of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for e-1040 and cefpirome, indicating activity against strains producing stably derepressed beta-lactamases. e-1040 appeared to be beta-lactamase stable, little influenced by testing systems or media, and was bactericidal. e-1040 seems to have promise as a parenteral beta-lactam for use on strains resistant to "third-generation" cephalosporins and other families of drugs such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  == in in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains  resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of acinetobacter spp. and aeromonas hydrophila. they were also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. other pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. both agents were highly active against haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher mics. gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and campylobacter coli/jejuni usually  susceptible. both antibiotics had good activity against staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. all streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. both antibiotics had little useful activity against the bacteroides fragilis group or bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. clostridium difficile and some other clostridium species were resistant.

TI  == in vitro activity of dirithromycin (ly 237216) compared with activities of other  macrolide antibiotics.
AB  == dirithromycin inhibited streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and other hemolytic streptococci at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.03 to 0.12 micrograms/ml, with 90% inhibition at 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is comparable to results using erythromycin. group a streptococci, listeriae, and enterococci resistant to erythromycin were resistant to dirithromycin. erythromycin-susceptible staphylococci were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but for erythromycin-resistant isolates mics were greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. for haemophilus influenzae, mics were greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold greater than for erythromycin. the activity of dirithromycin against staphylococci and streptococci was not decreased by the addition of human serum.

TI  == microbiology of empyema in children and adolescents.
AB  == the microbiology of empyema was studied in 72 children and adolescents whose specimens yielded bacterial growth after inoculation for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. a total of 93 organisms, 60 aerobic or facultative and 33 anaerobic, were isolated. aerobic bacteria was isolated in 48 (67%) patients, anaerobic bacteria in 17 (24%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 7 (10%). the predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were haemophilus influenzae (15 isolates), streptococcus pneumoniae (13), and staphylococcus aureus (10). the predominant anaerobes were bacteroides sp (15 isolates, including 7 bacteroides fragilis group and 5 bacteroides melaninogenicus group), anaerobic cocci (9), and fusobacterium sp (6). beta-lactamase activity was detected in at least one isolate in 20 (37%) of the 54 tested patients. these included all 8 tested s aureus and 7 b fragilis group, 3 of 10 h influenzae, 2 of 4 b melaninogenicus group, and 1 of 2 klebsiella pneumoniae. most cases of s pneumoniae and h influenzae were associated with pneumonia. the recovery of anaerobic bacteria was mostly associated with the concomitant diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, subdiaphragmatic abscess, and abscesses of dental or oropharyngeal origin. the data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in selected cases of empyema in children and adolescents.

TI  == implications of beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations.
AB  == resistance of many species of bacteria to beta-lactam antibiotics is mediated via inactivation by beta-lactamase. beta-lactamase inhibitors irreversibly bind to beta-lactamases and thus can prevent the destruction of active beta-lactam antibiotics. in the united states three beta-lactam-antibiotic/beta-lactam-inhibitor combinations are commercially available--the orally absorbed amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (a/c), the parenteral  formulations of ampicillin/sulbactam (a/s) and ticarcillin/clavulanate (t/c). in  a multicenter study that focused on t/c, the in vitro activity of amoxicillin (amox), ampicillin (amp) and ticarcillin (tic) against neisseria gonorrhoeae and  haemophilus influenzae was obliterated when beta-lactamase-positive strains were  tested, but all tested strains were susceptible to the antibiotics in combination with their respective beta-lactamase inhibitors. clavulanic acid improved the activity of tic against most species of enterobacteriaceae but not against those  enterobacteriaceae that elaborate type i beta-lactamase or against non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negative bacilli (except for pseudomonas maltophilia). staphylococci are generally beta-lactamase positive and considered  resistant to amp and tic, but greater than 99% of 1,137 staphylococcus aureus isolates and 92% of coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to t/c, with comparable figures obtained for a/c and a/s. the activity of tic against bacteroides fragilis was improved up to 64-fold by clavulanic acid, with  a definite but less pronounced effect on the non-fragilis bacteroides species. ninety-seven percent of strains of other anaerobic genera were susceptible to both tic and t/c.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity and susceptibility testing of ofloxacin. current  status.
AB  == the fluoroquinolone, ofloxacin, exhibits a broad antibacterial spectrum. based on our data and a review of the literature, ofloxacin inhibited essentially 100 percent of staphylococci, including oxacillin-resistant strains, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria spp. and branhamella catarrhalis. ninety-five percent of enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to ofloxacin. pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci were less susceptible: 79 and 63 percent, respectively, were susceptible (minimal inhibitory concentration [mic], less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml); 15 and 25 percent, respectively, were intermediate (mic, 4 micrograms/ml); 3 and 6 percent, respectively, were resistant (mic, more than or  equal to 4 micrograms/ml). clostridium spp., including clostridium difficile, were resistant to ofloxacin, but other anaerobic species, including the bacteroides fragilis group (over 90 percent) were either susceptible or intermediate to ofloxacin. ofloxacin is bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations of ofloxacin rarely exceed the mics by one doubling concentration. a modest inoculum effect has been observed with ofloxacin: mics with inocula of 10(7) colony-forming units/ml are often two- to fourfold higher than those with inocula of 5 x 10(5) colony-forming units/ml. susceptible organisms exposed serially to increasing concentrations of nalidixic acid developed increasing resistance to not only nalidixic acid, but also to all other quinolones, including ofloxacin. correlations of disk diffusion inhibitory zone diameters using the 5-micrograms ofloxacin disk with ofloxacin mics have been performed, and the disk diffusion zone diameter breakpoints recommended are: susceptible, greater than or equal to 16 mm; intermediate, 13 to 15 mm; resistant, less than or equal to 12 mm. quality control parameters also are summarized.

TI  == [determination of the mic of cefotetan against freshly isolated gram-negative bacilli].
AB  == antimicrobial activities (mics) of cefotetan (ctt) against 575 strains of 16 spp. of gram-negative bacilli isolated in 1988 were determined to investigate distribution of mics in comparison with those of cefmetazole (cmz), cefoxitin (cfx), latamoxef (lmox) and cefazolin (cez). the change in frequencies of incidence of cephem-resistant strains in the latter half of the 1980 was also investigated. distribution of mic of ctt varied with test strains. no or very few mics were at or higher than 12.5 micrograms/ml at an inoculation of 10(6) cfu/ml, thus rates of ctt-resistant strains were low among escherichia coli, citrobacter  diversus, klebsiella spp., proteus spp., providencia spp., and haemophilus influenzae. high rates of resistance to ctt were observed, however, among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, morganella morganii, and bacteroides fragilis. 2. most ctt-resistant strains of c. freundii, enterobacter spp. and s. marcescens were also resistant to lmox. these resistant  strains were considered to be multi-resistant strains to antibiotics including oxime type cephalosporins and monobactams. 3. cephem-resistant e. coli was confirmed to be resistant to 22% of cez, 14% of cfx, 10% of cmz and 2% of ctt tested. the incidence of cephem-resistant e. coli unconditionally showed an increasing tendency. 4. the incidence of resistant strains against cephamycins including ctt is discussed with regard to the mechanism of resistance against all beta-lactam antibiotics, and the problem of the appearance of resistant strains is close and inseparable from social background.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem alp-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new penem derivative alp-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. for comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. alp-201 was found to be highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, propioni-bacterium acnes, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium difficile were resistant to alp-201. when tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of alp-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. further investigations are warranted with alp-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.

AB  == beta-lactamase-producing staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis in a localized mixed infection has been found to degrade the beta-lactam antibiotic at the focus of infection, thus protecting both the bacteria and pathogens susceptible to the antibiotic. to determine if beta-lactamase produced by hemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis have similar importance in mixed infections, a thread infection model in mice was used to evaluate the capacity of beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus, b. catarrhalis, or h. influenzae to hydrolyze ampicillin in a mixed infection with streptococcus pneumoniae in mice. for both s. aureus and b. catarrhalis, the ampicillin concentrations at infection sites where beta-lactamase was produced were lower than at sites where beta-lactamase was not produced; however, this difference was not found when clavulanic acid was added to the ampicillin. in mixed infections with strains that did not produce beta-lactamase, ampicillin concentrations were  similar with or without clavulanic acid. s. aureus was the best "protector" followed by b. catarrhalis. the beta-lactamase produced by h. influenzae failed to protect the s. pneumoniae. no bactericidal effect of clavulanic acid was found.

TI  == inoculum effect.
AB  == the inoculum effect (ie) is a laboratory phenomenon that is described as a significant increase in the minimal inhibitory concentration of an antibiotic when the number of organisms inoculated is increased. the ie generally occurs with beta-lactam antibiotics in relation to beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. an ie occurs with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins against staphylococcus aureus and less often with the quinolones, beta-lactam-resistant penicillins, cefoxitin, and aminoglycosides. an ie occurs with the penicillins against the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas species, and a variable ie occurs  with cephalosporins; however, no ie occurs with aminoglycosides, quinolones, imipenem, and chloramphenicol against these organisms. an ie occurs with beta-lactam antibiotics against haemophilus influenzae and with the penicillins and the cephalosporins against penicillinase-producing neisseria gonorrhoeae and  branhamella catarrhalis. an ie occurs with the penicillins and cephalosporins against the bacteroides fragilis group; no ie occurs with cefoxitin and imipenem. although certain antibiotics exhibit an ie, they are still capable of eradicating infections when administered appropriately. thus, the clinical significance of this laboratory phenomenon has yet to be elucidated.

TI  == activities and sources of beta-lactamase in sputum from patients with bronchiectasis.
AB  == beta-lactamase activity was measured in secretions from patients with bronchiectasis. of 28 sputum samples, 23 contained measurable amounts of activity; values were significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in purulent samples than in mucoid or mucopurulent samples. beta-lactamase activity was usually present in saliva collected before and between sputum expectorations, although values for sputum were higher than for either group of saliva samples (p less than 0.025 and p less than 0.005, respectively). this difference suggests that at least part of sputum beta-lactamase activity originates in the bronchial tree. detailed microbiological study of a further eight specimens (seven were beta-lactamase positive) led to the isolation of haemophilus influenzae from six, although only two of these isolates were beta-lactamase positive. several other beta-lactamase-producing organisms were also isolated, including staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), escherichia coli (n = 1), proteus spp. (n = 1), and bacteroides spp. (n = 3). size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography of the sputum showed several peaks of beta-lactamase activity which usually coeluted in fractions similar to those of their beta-lactamase-positive isolates. therefore,  sources of sputum beta-lactamases are often bacteria not considered truly pathogenic or not isolated during routine bacteriological assessment. these observations should be considered when embarking on antimicrobial therapy in bronchiectatic patients and suggest that increased dosages of penicillins are indicated.

TI  == a clinical evaluation of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  == we have treated 42 episodes of pediatric infections with sulbactam/ampicillin since 1987. included were 9 cellulitis, 9 urinary tract infections, 5 cervical lymphadenitis, 4 meningitis, 2 thoracic empyema, 2 osteomyelitis, 2 sepsis, 1 furuncle, 1 perianal abscess, 1 dental abscess, 1 peritonsillitis, 1 salmonellosis, 1 shigellosis, 1 peritonitis, 1 suppurative thyroiditis, 1 infective endocarditis. responsible pathogens were escherichia coli in 8, staphylococcus aureus in 6, hemophilus influenzae in 2, streptococcus pneumoniae  in 3, streptococcus viridans in 2, staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, bacteroides fragilis in 1, salmonella d1 in 1, shigella sonnei in 1, klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, enterobacter agglomerans in 1, acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 1, enterobacter  cloacae in 1, group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus in 1, and polymicrobial infection in 4 cases. thirty-nine out of 41 (95%) clinically evaluable patients cured and all (34/34) bacteriologically evaluable patients eradicated their pathogens after treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin. side reactions were seen in  five patients; one maculopapular skin rash, one hemolytic anemia, two diarrhea, and one liver function impairment plus leukopenia. all these reactions were transient and did not require interruption of therapy. these results indicate that sulbactam/ampicillin is safe and effective in the treatment of common pediatric infections beyond the neonatal period.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == cefuroxime axetil.
AB  == cefuroxime axetil is a orally active prodrug formulation of cefuroxime, which upon absorption undergoes immediate deesterification to free cefuroxime. cefuroxime axetil offers an in vitro antibacterial spectrum against many gram-positive and some gram-negative organisms. its beta-lactamase stability makes it useful in treating a variety of infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and staphylococcus aureus. cefuroxime axetil has good activity against the enterobacteriaceae and moderate activity against non-bacteroides fragilis anaerobes. clinical studies suggest it is at least as effective as ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, penicillin v, or cefaclor in the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, acute otitis media, upper respiratory infections, skin and soft tissue infections, and uncomplicated  gonorrhea.

TI  == the role of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in respiratory tract infections.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, bacteroides sp. (bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, and bacteroides fragilis), peptostreptococci and fusobacterium sp. are important pathogens in respiratory tract infections (rti). these organisms are often recovered mixed with other aerobic, facultative  and anaerobic bacteria. a recent increase in numbers of bet-lactamase producing strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in rti has been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in eradication of these infections. these  infections include chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, chronic recurrent tonsillitis and lung abscesses. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin  therapy but also to protect penicillin susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of anaerobic bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.

TI  == changes in expression of bacterial surface antigens induced by antibiotics and their influence on host defenses.
AB  == concomitant with the discovery that a number of antibiotics were able to induce profound morphological changes (increased septation, thickened walls, filamentation) at low concentrations their ability to inhibit bacterial protein/polysaccharide synthesis was determined. in particular toxin and extracellular enzyme biosynthesis could be repressed by the lincosamines, fusidic acid, erythromycin and streptomycin in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, propionibacterium acnes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. several of these exoproducts act as antigens associated with microbial virulence  and are therefore of importance in pathogenicity. likewise structural components  such as fimbriae in escherichia coli, m protein in streptococcus pyogenes, protein a in staphylococcus aureus and capsule in bacteroides fragilis and haemophilus influenzae were not synthesised when the producer bacteria were grown in low concentrations of antibiotic. these products, through their importance as  impedins of opsonization and subsequent phagocytosis by white blood cells, are important determinants in the host-parasite relationship. by their loss during drug exposure, potentiation of opsonophagocytosis occurred leading to more rapid  killing of the pathogen. the immunogenicity of the antibiotic-damaged bacteria was also changed under these circumstances.

AB  == the tetracyclines are effective in the treatment of chlamydia, mycoplasma pneumoniae, and rickettsial infections and may also be used for gonococcal infections in patients unable to tolerate penicillins. these drugs may cause gastrointestinal irritation, photo-toxic dermatitis, diarrhea, vestibular damage, and hepatotoxicity in pregnant women. chloramphenicol is used primarily for anaerobic infections, haemophilus influenzae meningitis, and typhoid fever. the most important toxic effect of chloramphenicol is bone marrow suppression, which  can be dose related or idiosyncratic. erythromycin is the drug of choice for the  treatment of infections caused by m. pneumoniae, legionella species, group a beta-hemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the frequency of serious untoward effects associated with the use of erythromycin is low; epigastric distress may occur. clindamycin is active against bacteroides fragilis and other anaerobic microorganisms. pseudomembranous enterocolitis has developed  in as many as 10% of patients taking this drug. the use of clindamycin should be  discontinued promptly if diarrhea occurs.

AB  == ceforanide is a 'second generation' cephalosporin administered intravenously or intramuscularly. it is similar to cefamandole and cefonicid in its in vitro superiority to 'first generation' cephalosporins against several species of enterobacteriaceae as well as its activity against haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. its activity against staphylococcus aureus is less than that of cefamandole, cefuroxime and first generation cephalosporins. the in vitro activity against neisseria gonorrhoeae is excellent. pseudomonas, acinetobacter and serratia species, and bacteroides fragilis are resistant, as are many strains of proteus and providencia species. the elimination half-life is relatively long, although shorter than that of cefonicid, and in most clinical trials ceforanide has been administered twice daily. it appeared to be comparable in therapeutic efficacy to procaine penicillin and cephazolin in the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, to cephazolin in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections due  to s. aureus or beta-haemolytic streptococci and to cefapirin in s. aureus endocarditis in parenteral drug abusers. also, it was comparable in efficacy to cephalothin in the prophylaxis of infection in patients undergoing open heart surgery or vaginal hysterectomy, and to cephazolin in patients undergoing cholecystectomy. thus, ceforanide is an alternative to first and certain other second generation cephalosporins in several important therapeutic and prophylactic situations. it has no advantage over other cephalosporins with regard to spectrum of antibacterial activity, but has a longer half-life than other second generation cephalosporins, except cefonicid, and can be administered according to a twice daily dosage schedule.

TI  == recovery of beta-lactamase producing bacteria in pediatric infections.
AB  == the presence of beta-lactamase producing bacteria (beta lpb) was investigated in  specimens obtained from 1469 children who presented with infections of the skin and soft tissue (648), upper respiratory tract (514), pulmonary sites (137), surgical sites (113), and other (57). of 4989 bacterial isolates recovered, 910 (18%) were beta lpb, 492 (54%) aerobes, and 418 (46%) anaerobes. the beta lpb were recovered in 751 (51%) of the children. the most frequently recovered beta lpb was staphylococcus aureus, which was recovered in 356 (47%) patients. most isolates were recovered from patients with skin and soft-tissue infections (68% of patients), upper respiratory tract infections (49%), and pulmonary infections  (35%). bacteroides fragilis group was isolated in 35% of patients with beta lpb,  mostly from surgical infections (98% of patients), pulmonary infections (36%), skin and soft-tissue infections (25%), and upper respiratory tract infections (20%). twenty-five percent of the bacteroides melaninogenicus group produced beta-lactamase. these organisms were recovered in 15% of patients with beta lpb.  they were recovered in upper respiratory tract infections (38% of patients), pulmonary infections (22%), and skin and soft-tissue infections (7%). other beta  lpb were pseudomonas aeruginosa (8% of total patients with beta lpb), escherichia coli (4%), bacteroides oralis (3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), haemophilus influenzae (2%), proteus (1%), and branhamella catarrhalis (1%). the role of beta lpb in the failure of penicillin to eradicate many of the infections is discussed.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of cefuzonam in the field  of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  == to study the transfer of cefuzonam (czon, l-105) into female genital organs, concentrations of the compound in pelvic dead space exudate were measured in cases of radical hysterectomy due to cervical cancer and analyzed by the two-compartment model. when czon 1 g was drip-infused intravenously, the concentration in the cubital vein blood was 46.95 micrograms/ml at 1 hour after the start of infusion. concentrations in the pelvic dead space exudate reached the peak of 11.29 micrograms/ml at 2.44 hours after the start, were higher than 4 micrograms/ml after 8 hours and were higher than 1.7 micrograms/ml after 12 hours. the area under the concentration-time curve in the pelvic dead space exudate was 77.85 micrograms x hr/ml. from these results czon was considered to be effective when administered at 1 g against infections of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, and haemophilus influenzae, but increased dose levels seemed necessary  against infections of staphylococcus epidermidis and bacteroides fragilis. in 3 cases of obstetric and gynecological infections the efficacy of czon was good in  2 cases and unknown in the other case.

TI  == a review of the role of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in obstetric-gynecologic infections.
AB  == beta-lactam antibiotics are the most commonly used antibiotics in obstetrics and  gynecology. however, they are susceptible to inactivation when attacked by beta-lactamase, an enzyme produced by many bacterial species. during the past three decades, numerous penicillins and cephalosporins have been made with a stable beta-lactam ring that resists enzyme attack. more recently enzyme inhibitors have been discovered that inactivate beta-lactamase. the combination of an enzyme inhibitor with a beta-lactam antibiotic, such as ampicillin, restores the antimicrobial activity of the beta-lactam against formerly resistant strains of staphylococci, haemophilus influenzae, enterobacteriaceae, and bacteroides fragilis.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. a total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). ofloxacin was highly active against e. coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, salmonella sp., campylobacter jejuni, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, eubacterium sp., propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus sp. pseudomonas sp., serratia sp. and proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. high percentages of resistance to ofloxacin  were found only for providencia sp., proteus rettgeri and bacteroides fragilis. with regard to streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and mic determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of roxithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, in comparison with that of erythromycin.
AB  == a study was made of the in-vitro activity of roxithromycin in comparison with that of erythromycin on selected recent clinical isolates of a wide range of organisms. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by an agar dilution method with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu. minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) and the effect of ph were determined by a broth dilution method on selected strains. in general the in-vitro activity of roxithromycin mirrored that of erythromycin, but it was slightly less active. most strains of streptococci, with the exception of enterococci, were highly sensitive to roxithromycin, as were isolates of gardnerella vaginalis. branhamella catarrhalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. staphylococci and enterococci were only moderately sensitive to both agents as was haemophilus influenzae. most anaerobic bacteria were sensitive although bacteroides fragilis, fusobacteria and some strains of some clostridial species were moderately resistant. the mbcs were usually at least 16-fold higher than mics for most staphylococci, enterococci, alpha-haemolytic streptococci and b. fragilis; but for beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, h. influenzae and b. catarrhalis the mbcs were usually only 2- to 4-fold higher than mics. roxithromycin was most active at ph 8 and generally for each unit fall in ph there was a 4-fold diminution of activity. however, the effect was less marked for pneumococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci and h. influenzae.

TI  == sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  == bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides  fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == variation in the potentiation of beta-lactam antibiotic activity by clavulanic acid and sulbactam against multiply antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == using a broth microdilution method, we studied 120 strains of beta-lactamase-producing clinical isolates to determine the potentiating effect of clavulanic acid and sulbactam (both beta-lactamase inhibitors) on the antibacterial activity of a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics. all antibiotics were tested alone and in combination with each inhibitor simultaneously using low (10(5) cfu/ml) and high (10(7) cfu/ml) inocula. against the strains of escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae the addition of both inhibitors significantly potentiated the activity of most antibiotics at the low inoculum. at the high inoculum, however, this effect was abrogated against e. coli and most strains of h. influenzae. antibiotic activity was significantly enhanced by the inhibitors at both inoculum sizes with bacteroides fragilis. antibiotic resistance of pseudomonas aeruginosa was little affected by the inhibitors. among methicillin-resistant staphylococci, antibiotic potentiation by the inhibitors was more significant for staphylococcus aureus than the coagulase-negative staphylococci.

AB  == the antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. these included ticarcillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. in addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of  hemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. the bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). in these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in  vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of a novel penem fce 22101 compared to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == fce 22101 is a penem antibiotic which inhibits the majority of enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations of 0.5-4 mg/l. it inhibits staphylococci, haemolytic streptococci  and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species are resistant. bacteroides fragilis and  clostridium species are inhibited by less than or equal to 1 mg/l. fce 22101 is not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chrosmosomal beta-lactamases. it shows minimal discrepancy between mic and mbc values and there is minimal effect of inoculum size. although fce 22101 is generally less active against enterobacteriaceae than are cefotaxime and ceftazidime, it does inhibit some enterobacter spp. resistant to these agents. fce 22101 and imipenem are similar in activity against gram-positive and anaerobic species.

TI  == the activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefotetan compared to other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefotetan was assessed against beta-lactamase producing  clinical isolates. the majority of enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml with 50% of isolates inhibited by less than or equal  to 1 microgram/ml. cefotetan inhibited organisms resistant to cefazolin, cefonicid and cefoperazone, but not isolates of enterobacter, citrobacter or serratia resistant to ceftizoxime. cefotetan inhibited beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, but it did not inhibit acinetobacter or pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefotetan was as active as cefoxitin against anaerobic species such as bacteroides fragilis and clostridium. cefotetan was not hydrolyzed by richmond-sykes plasmid beta-lactamases of type iii such as tem and shv, nor by the oxa or pse beta-lactamases. it also was not hydrolyzed by cephalosporinases of richmond-sykes type ia or id. cefotetan inhibited beta-lactamases of the type  ia and id, but it also induced these beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae and c. freundii.

TI  == sch 34343: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of the penem sch 34343 was assessed in comparison with third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and imipenem. sch 34343 was active, with mics generally 2 mg/1 or less, against a broad spectrum of organisms amongst which were staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), streptococci  (though enterococci were less susceptible with sch 34343 mics mostly 4-8 mg/1), anaerobes (including the bacteroides fragilis group), haemophilus influenzae and  neisseria gonorrhoeae. it was also active against the enterobacteriaceae though enterobacter cloacae and serratia spp. were somewhat less susceptible than other  members of this group. sch 34343 lacked useful activity against most species of pseudomonas (including ps. aeruginosa) but was active against ps. acidovorans and some isolates of ps. cepacia. sch 34343 showed a high degree of resistance to plasmid-determined and most chromosomally-determined beta-lactamases; however, it was hydrolysed rapidly by enzymes from some isolates of aeromonas hydrophila and  more slowly by enzymes from ps. maltophilia and bact. melaninogenicus subspecies  intermedius. we did not observe any reduction in sensitivity to sch 34343 for most beta-lactamase-producing organisms, including strains of enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii that were resistant to most other beta-lactams.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a new n-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (ama-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against staphylococcus aureus. the mics of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest mics of the antibiotics tested. the mic of carumonam for 90% of klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. the superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. the mic of carumonam for 90% of p. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the mics of aztreonam and ceftazidime. carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of s. aureus and bacteroides fragilis. carumonam was  resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal  beta-lactamases. it was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of k. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. in general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam  and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (mic); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == encapsulation and protection against phagocytosis by bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the capsular polysaccharide of bacteroides fragilis is most probably an important virulence factor as shown by its ability to protect against phagocytosis in in vitro studies, and by its abscess-promoting ability in experimental in vivo studies. immunity against the capsular polysaccharide, either in the form of humoral antibodies or as cell-mediated immunity, can facilitate phagocytosis or prevent abscess formation. the capsular polysaccharides in two reference strains  examined so far are complex in structure, and seem to be strain specific. the b.  fragilis lipopolysaccharide has a relatively low endotoxic activity when compared to lipopolysaccharides from bacteria belonging to enterobacteriaceae. structurally the b. fragilis lipopolysaccharide has a relatively low molecular weight, and short polysaccharide chains similar to those found in lipopolysaccharides from rough mutants of enterobacteriaceae or from capsulated bacteria such as neisseria meningitidis and haemophilus influenzae.

TI  == cefonicid: a long-acting, second-generation cephalosporin. antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy and adverse effects.
AB  == cefonicid is a new second-generation cephalosporin with a broad antimicrobial spectrum of activity and a prolonged serum elimination half-life. it has good in  vitro activity against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, nonenterococcal streptococci, hemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis and many of the commonly isolated enterobacteriaceae. organisms usually resistant to cefonicid include species of pseudomonas, serratia, acinetobacter and providencia, and bacteroides fragilis. the drug is 98% protein bound in human serum, which probably contributes to its significant reduction of antimicrobial activity measured in serum. limited clinical trials have demonstrated it to be effective for surgical prophylaxis and for treating infections of the urinary tract, lower respiratory tract and bone. failures have  been reported in treatment of soft tissue infections and endocarditis caused by s. aureus. a potential cost reduction may be achieved by administering a single daily dose of cefonicid for established infections or a single preoperative dose  for effective surgical prophylaxis instead of multiple-dose regimens of other, similar agents.

AB  == a review is given of the microbiological properties of imipenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic with an exceptionally broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. an evaluation of results of numerous in vitro studies reveals that imipenem effectively inhibited growth of 53 of 55 bacterial species, the mean mic90 being  less than 8 mg/l. the mic90 for cocci, with the exception of staphylococcus epidermidis, is in the range of 0.01-3.1 mg/l. the mic90 for all enterobacteriaceae is equal to or less than 8 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are generally susceptible to imipenem, only pseudomonas maltophilia and pseudomonas cepacia showing intrinsic  resistance. imipenem is currently the most active drug available against anaerobic bacteria, the mic usually being below 1 mg/l even for bacteroides fragilis. rare bacteria such as nocardia asteroides, listeria monocytogenes or fast growing mycobacterium spp. which cause difficult-to-treat infections are also susceptible to imipenem. increases in inoculum size have only a minimal effect on activity of the drug. in most species the mbc only slightly exceeded the mic; however in the case of streptococcus faecalis the mbc value was many times the mic value. synergism has been observed in combinations of imipenem with aminoglycosides, and antagonism in combinations with other beta-lactam antibiotics against pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens. imipenem is stable in the presence of the common chromosomal and plasmid-mediated enzymes. induction of inactivating enzymes was observed in staphylococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens.

TI  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of desacetylcefotaxime compared to other related beta-lactams.
AB  == like all other cephalosporins that contain an acetyl side chain in the 3' position, cefotaxime (ctx) is partially desacetylated in vivo. desacetylcefotaxime (des-ctx) possesses a broad antimicrobial spectrum and high beta-lactamase stability. with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, morganella morganii, bacteroides fragilis, and staphylococcus aureus, most strains of other species tested usually had mean mics of des-ctx lower than 1 microgram/ml. its activity is generally lower than that of the parent compound. it was only against some strains of p. cepacia that des-ctx surpassed the activity of ctx. the activity of des-ctx markedly exceeds the activity of many therapeutically used cephalosporins. this is especially true for haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, most species of enterobacteriaceae, and streptococci other than streptococcus faecalis.

TI  == in vitro comparison of the activity of ru 28965, a new macrolide, with that of erythromycin against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == ru 28965, a novel macrolide antibiotic, inhibited most gram-positive species at concentrations similar to that of erythromycin but was not active, even at alkaline ph, against pseudomonas spp. or members of the family enterobacteriaceae. staphylococci and streptococci resistant to erythromycin were resistant to ru 28965. ru 28965 inhibited haemophilus influenzae, including a number of beta-lactamase, ampicillin-resistant isolates, and neisseria meningitidis and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations similar to those of erythromycin. against anaerobic species, bacteroides fragilis and clostridia and  fusobacterium spp., ru 28965 was less active than erythromycin, but its activity  against campylobacter and legionella spp. was similar to that of erythromycin.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of ciprofloxacin , a new 4-quinolone, was compared with that of norfloxacin and nalidixic acid against recent clinical isolates of medically important bacteria. overall, ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin had similar  spectra of activity, but ciprofloxacin had somewhat greater intrinsic activity against most organisms. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were in the range 0.004-4 mg/l for enterobacteriaceae, 0.016-2 mg/l for pseudomonas spp., 0.004-1 mg/l for acinetobacter, 0.004-0.016 mg/l for haemophilus influenzae, 0.001-0.004  for gonococci, 0.004-0.03 mg/l for cmpylobacter , 0.12-2 mg/l for staphylococci,  0.25-4 mg/l for streptococci, 1-32 mg/l for the bacteroides fragilis group and mostly in the range 0.25-8 mg/l for other obligate anaerobes. resistant variants  could be selected readily in vitro by culture on any of the three compounds investigated. however, while the mics of nalidixic acid were high for these variants those of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin were much lower.

TI  == significance of encapsulated bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups in mixed infections.
AB  == organisms of the bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides fragilis groups are  often found mixed with facultatively anaerobic organisms in infections. the relative importance of these bacteroides groups and facultative anaerobic pathogens in mixed infections was investigated in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. this was determined by observing the effect of antimicrobial therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. clindamycin or metronidazole was used for treatment of infections caused by bacteroides species, and either gentamicin, penicillin, ampicillin, or oxacillin was used for treatment of infections caused by facultative flora. in almost all instances the  aerobic counterparts in the infection were more important than the unencapsulated bacteroides species. on the other hand, encapsulated b. melaninogenicus group organisms were found to be more important in abscess formation than were group a  streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus. encapsulated b. fragilis group organisms were found to be more important than or as important as escherichia coli and group d streptococci and less important than s. aureus, group a streptococci, and k. pneumoniae in induction of subcutaneous abscesses. this study demonstrates that encapsulated bacteroides species are a factor that should be considered in the treatment of mixed infections with antibiotics.

AB  == three derivatives of oleandomycin in which the c"-4 hydroxyl moiety was replaced  for the first time with a nitrogen functionality have been compared with erythromycin base and oleandomycin base. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of these derivatives for 90% of a group of clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus were one-half to one-fourth those of erythromycin. the minimum inhibitory  concentrations of the experimental macrolides for 50% of a group of s. aureus isolates resistant to greater than 12.5 micrograms of erythromycin per ml ranged  from 0.2 to 0.39 micrograms/ml. the activities of these experimental compounds were equivalent to the activities of erythromycin against staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides fragilis, and haemophilus influenzae isolates. in general, erythromycin was more active against streptococcus species. each experimental macrolide was superior to erythromycin in inhibiting rna-directed, cell-free polypeptide synthesis. the three experimental compounds were markedly more active than erythromycin base after oral administration to mice infected with s. aureus. the 50% protective doses of the experimental compounds ranged from 27.4 to 45.7 mg/kg; that of erythromycin was approximately 100 mg/kg.

TI  == trends in the development of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == in many ways it is ironic that the first description of a beta-lactamase occurred in 1940 with an enzyme isolated from escherichia coli since in recent years there has been a major interest in gram-negative species and the development of agents  to overcome the hydrolytic action of beta-lactamases of gram-negative species. there have been four distinctly different approaches to the development of new beta-lactam antibiotics. these have been the search for inhibitors of beta-lactamases and agents such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam are examples of  compounds which by virtue of kcat function act as suicide inhibitors and make old antibiotics new. there has been the modification of the penicillin and cephem nucleus to increase beta-lactamase stability or failing that to improve the ability of the compounds to pass through the cell wall and increase affinity for  critical beta-lactam receptors, i.e. penicillin-binding proteins. there has been  the development of carbapenem type of agents such as imipenem which would have broad activity including aerobic, anaerobic, gram-positive and gram-negative species. there has been the discovery of the monobactam agents of which aztreonam is an example of a compound with great beta-lactamase stability but with activity limited to gram-negative aerobic species. bacterial resistance has indeed been the major factor that has modified use of beta-lactams and influenced the development of the aforementioned types of drugs. the widespread presence of beta-lactamases in common pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis has made it necessary to have beta-lactamase stable compounds for initial therapy of infection. it is possible to analyze structure-activity relations of beta-lactam compounds to determine changes which  will be most advantageous in light of known and expected resistance patterns. but the increased realization in recent years of the importance of the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam drugs has made it essential that the development  of new compounds be based on an integration of microbiological and pharmacokinetic parameters. interest in the prevention of resistant flora has also affected the development of new drugs since it is increasingly appreciated that alteration of intestinal flora contributes to selection of drug resistant microorganisms. finally, new toxicities or adverse effects associated with the use of certain new agents has modified the development of certain compounds.

AB  == the in vitro activity of the novel beta-lactam antibiotic, n-formimidoyl thienamycin (n-f thienamycin) has been compared with those of cefoxitin and tobramycin. an agar dilution method was employed. n-f thienamycin was active against all enterobacteriaceae isolates (mic less than or equal to 4 mg/l). all pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 2 mg/l. n-f thienamycin was also active against acinetobacter calcoaceticus (96 per cent inhibited by 0.5 mg/l) and gram-positive cocci. all enterococci were inhibited by 2 mg/l. the drug was active against haemophilus influenzae (mic less than or equal to 1 mg/l) and  the bacteroides fragilis group (mic less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l). cefoxitin was inactive against most enterobacter and a. calcoaceticus isolates and all p. aeruginosa and enterococcal isolates. tobramycin was virtually inactive against gram-positive cocci other than staphylococcus aureus. n-f thienamycin thus has a  broad spectrum of in vitro activity, greater than that of cefoxitin and tobramycin, and may therefore be useful in the treatment of serious infection, particularly when the aetiology is unknown.

TI  == cefotetan: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefotetan was assessed against recent clinical isolates of common bacteria and also against reference strains that produced known beta-lactamases. the compound was active against most staphylococci (mics 4 to 8 mg/l) though methicillin-resistant strains were less sensitive. it was also generally active against streptococci (mics mostly in the  range 1 to 16 mg/l). however, enterococci and penicillin-resistant pneumococci were resistant. cefotetan was highly active against enterobacteria, with 75% of isolates inhibited by 0.5 mg/l and 90% inhibited by 4 mg/l. it was also highly active against haemophilus influenzae (mics 0.5 to 4 mg/l) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics 0.06 to 2 mg/l) but had relatively poor activity against acinetobacter spp. (mics mostly 4 to 128 mg/l). cefotetan had little useful activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics 16 to 512 mg/l) but was more active against most other pseudomonads. cefotetan had moderate activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mics mostly less than or equal to 32 mg/l), though bact. fragilis sensu stricto and bact. vulgatus were more sensitive (mics usually less than or equal to 4 mg/l). it was more active against most other anaerobes, though its activity was always exceeded by that of ampicillin. cefotetan possessed a high degree of resistance to both plasmid-mediated and chromosomally-determined beta-lactamases.

AB  == cefotetan is a new, potent, 7 alpha-methoxy cephalosporin (cephamycin). the in vitro activity of cefotetan tested in a multiphasic, collaborative study against  12,260 consecutive clinical isolates and 448 selected isolates showed 93% of enterobacteriaceae, 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (broth dilution), 83% of bacteroides fragilis, and 72% of non-enterococcal streptococci  to be inhibited by less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. beta-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing haemophilus influenzae strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. cefotetan's inhibitory spectrum paralleled those of the newest generation of cephems and exceeded those  of cefoxitin and cefamandole. no useful activity was present against streptococcus faecalis or pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefotetan was bactericidal without significant inoculum effect and was highly resistant to hydrolysis by richmond-sykes types i, iii, and iv beta-lactamases. hydrolysis of the chromogenic cephalosporin padac (pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline cephalosporin)  by type i beta-lactamases was markedly inhibited by concentrations of cefotetan similar to those of the potent inhibitor dicloxacillin. analysis of agar disk diffusion for several disk potencies and broth dilution susceptibility tests by regression and error rate-bounding methods produced preliminary tentative zone standards (30-micrograms disk, using minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml susceptible and greater than 32 micrograms/ml resistant, or 75-micrograms disk, using minimal inhibitory concentration breakpoints of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml susceptible and greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml resistant) of greater than or equal to 18 mm susceptible, less than or equal to 14 mm resistant, and 15 to 17 mm indeterminate. staphylococcus aureus testing with the 30-micrograms disk is not recommended.

TI  == cefotaxime: a review of in vitro antimicrobial properties and spectrum of activity.
AB  == cefotaxime has remarkable potency against all enterobacteriaceae, including enterobacter species, citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, and morganella morganii, proteus vulgaris, and providencia species--all of which are resistant to earlier cephalosporins. cefotaxime generally inhibits greater than 90% of enteric bacilli at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml; in one study it inhibited greater than 98% of isolates at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. for staphylococci and nonenterococcal streptococci, the mean values for the minimal inhibitory concentration50 (mic50) of cefotaxime (i.e., the lowest concentration inhibiting growth of 50% of tested strains) are 1.1-1.9  microgram/ml and 0.01-0.05 microgram/ml, respectively. cefotaxime is inactive against streptococcus faecalis and most other serogroup d streptococci. it is moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50, 19 microgram/ml) and acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus (mic50, 18 microgram/ml). because the activity of cefotaxime against other pseudomonads and nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli varies, in vitro susceptibility testing must be used as a guide to therapy. cefotaxime is potent against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria species. infections due to beta-lactamase-producing gonococci have been treated effectively with cefotaxime (mic, mode = less than or equal to 0.004 microgram/ml). most anaerobes are highly susceptible to cefotaxime, but the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 10%-20% of bacteroides fragilis strains (mic50, 5.3 microgram/ml) and other bacteroides species may exceed obtainable serum concentrations. the potent antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime appears to  be the result of a combination of characteristics which include: beta-lactamase stability (types i, iii, iv, and v), good ability to pass through the cell membrane, strong affinity for lethal penicillin-binding proteins 1a, 1b(s), and 3, minimal limitation by the inoculum effect, and bactericidal action at or close to the inhibitory concentration. clinically useful methods of susceptibility testing have been developed and can be recommended for clinical laboratory use.

TI  == the history and background of augmentin.
AB  == bacterial resistance to the beta-lactam group of antibiotics is frequently due to the production of beta-lactamase which brings about the inactivation of the antibiotic. clavulanic acid is a naturally occurring inhibitor of beta-lactamase  which is capable of rendering penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant organisms sensitive. the compound is obtained by fermentation from streptomyces clavuligerus. clavulanic acid shows some structural similarity to the penicillins and cephalosporins and functions as a progressive inhibitor of a wide range of beta-lactamases including those found in escherichia coli, klebsiella aerogenes,  proteus species, bacteroides fragilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococcus aureus. clavulanic acid is well absorbed when given by mouth and a formulation with amoxycillin (augmentin; beechams) is now available for clinical use.

TI  == chloramphenicol: properties and clinical use.
AB  == chloramphenicol was introduced into medical practice in 1949. at therapeutic concentrations of 10 to 20 micrograms drug per ml, the drug inhibits bacterial ribosomal and, to a lesser extent, mammalian mitochondrial protein synthesis but  concentrations above 60 micrograms drug per ml induce progressive reduction of oxygen-dependent cellular metabolism. some adverse reactions (e.g. bone marrow suppression and the "gray baby syndrome") reflect these effects. the pathogenesis of chloramphenicol-induced aplastic anemia remains unclear. chloramphenicol is most bioavailable after oral administration and has a remarkable ability to diffuse into body fluids and tissues. however, there are wide interindividual variations in its metabolism and elimination, particularly in newborns. chloramphenicol is indicated for invasive ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae infections; for patients allergic to penicillin with pneumococcal, meningococcal  or h. influenzae meningitis; in patients under 8 years of age with rocky mountain spotted fever; and for the treatment of brain abscess and other severe anaerobic  infections (excluding endocarditis) due to b. fragilis. other indications include selected patients with salmonella meningitis or carditis, rickettsioses and intraocular infections. unravelling the pathogenesis of chloramphenicol-induced aplastic anemia is critical to more widespread application of this remarkable antimicrobial.

TI  == pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore, a new chromogenic cephalosporin for rapid beta-lactamase testing.
AB  == a new chromogenic cephalosporin, pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore,  was evaluated for use in a rapid paper strip or tube test for the detection of beta-lactamases from a variety of microorganisms. a 1-min pyridinium-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline chromophore paper strip test was found to be a convenient and accurate method for the detection of beta-lactamase-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, although it could not be relied upon to detect beta-lactamases produced by staphylococci, enteric organisms, or bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == chloramphenicol: recent developments and clinical indications.
AB  == recent developments (including more accurate assays) that have led to revised recommendations for route of administration, dosage, and indications for chloramphenicol are reviewed. chloramphenicol is most bioavailable by the oral route; doses of 75 mg/kg/day provide adequate therapeutic concentrations for most clinical indications. serum concentrations of the drug should be monitored to ensure adequate therapeutic concentrations and to avoid toxicity. this is particularly important in newborns, in patients with liver dysfunction, and in those receiving concomitant drugs that may influence free chloramphenicol concentrations. the indications for chloramphenicol therapy evaluated are: haemophilus influenzae infections, anaerobic infections, salmonellosis, rocky mountain spotted fever, and eye infections. chloramphenicol is useful in the treatment of invasive haemophilus influenzae infections resistant to ampicillin,  in selected anaerobic and ocular infections, and for rickettsioses in patients under the age of eight years. because the rare but life-threatening complication  of chloramphenicol (aplastic anemia) persists, indications for the drug's clinical use are narrowing once again with the advent of third-generation cephalosporins highly active against gram-negative bacilli including ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae. similarly, metronidazole or clindamycin may be preferred for some anaerobic infections.

AB  == the in vitro activity of norfloxacin (mk-0366) compared with that of beta-lactam  antibiotics and, where appropriate of gentamicin or metronidazole was assessed against recent clinical isolates of common bacteria. the compound was highly active against most enterobacteria (minimal inhibitory concentrations [mics], 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml; 90% inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml), haemophilus influenzae (mics, 0.03 to 0.12 micrograms/ml), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics, 0.008 to 0.016 micrograms/ml). it was also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa  (mics, 0.12 to 2 micrograms/ml), most other pseudomonads (mics, 0.03 to 32 micrograms/ml), and acinetobacter calcoaceticus (mics 0.06 to 4 micrograms/ml). norfloxacin was somewhat less active against staphylococci (mics, 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml; 1 microgram/ml required to inhibit 50% of isolates) and streptococci (mics, 0.5 to 64 micrograms/ml). members of the bacteroides fragilis group of anaerobes were relatively resistant to norfloxacin (mics, 8 to 128 micrograms/ml), as were most other anaerobes.

TI  == efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  == ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. the clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. the bacteria isolated included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, other bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. there were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. no serious drug toxicities were observed. at a dosage regimen of 1 g  every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.

TI  == the in vitro activity of moxalactam against 430 clinical, bacterial isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the novel beta-lactam antibiotic moxalactam against 430  bacterial isolates was determined by an agar dilution method. moxalactam was highly active against enterobacteriaceae including indole-positive proteus and providencia, all isolates being susceptible to 1.0 microgram/ml or less. the drug was somewhat less active against gram-positive cocci and pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and enterococci were highly resistant. all haemophilus influenzae isolates were inhibited by 0.06 microgram/ml or less. activity against bacteroides fragilis was good but wide variations of minimal inhibitory concentrations were noted. moxalactam may become a useful alternative to the aminoglycosides in the treatment of serious infections caused by gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == augmentin: laboratory studies.
AB  == clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam antibiotic which, although it has little intrinsic activity, is a potent inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases. when combined with amoxycillin its range of activity includes penicillinase-producing  strains of staphylococcus aureus and many of the beta-lactamase-producing strains of gram-negative bacilli. bacteria sensitive to augmentin include amoxycillin-resistant strains of haemophilus influenzae and escherichia coli, in  addition strains of klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and bacteroides fragilis are usually sensitive. the beta-lactamases produced by enterobacter spp, proteus morgani, serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa are less susceptible to clavulanic acid and these bacteria are usually resistant  to augmentin (1).

TI  == cefmenoxime (sce-1365), a new cephalosporin: in vitro activity, comparison with other antimicrobial agents, beta-lactamase stability, and disk diffusion testing  with tentative interpretive criteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce-1365) was evaluated in a multiphased collaborative investigation. over 7,500 consecutive clinical isolates were tested in five laboratories, and greater than 90% of the following organisms were inhibited by cefmenoxime at the following concentrations: enterobacteriaceae and  non-enterococcal streptococci, </=0.125 mug/ml; staphylococcus aureus, </=2.0 mug/ml; and nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli and bacteroides fragilis group, </=32 mug/ml. both beta-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by cefmenoxime at </=0.03 mug/ml. the spectrum of cefmenoxime was similar to that of other, newer cephalosporins, particularly cefotaxime. a pronounced inoculum effect was found with some species upon increasing inocula from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units per ml, resulting in an approximate eightfold increase in minimum inhibitory concentrations. cefmenoxime was bactericidal when tested with inocula  of 10(5) colonyforming units per ml, and mean differences between the minimum inhibitory concentration and the minimum lethal concentration were less than one  log(2) dilution. no significant hydrolysis of cefmenoxime by five different beta-lactamases was detectable, and cefmenoxime exhibited marked inhibition of type i beta-lactamases. regression and error rate-bounded analyses of results of  disk diffusion and reference broth microdilution susceptibility tests were performed on 421 bacterial isolates, and the following tentative zone size breakpoints are proposed: >/=22 mm, susceptible; </=14 mm, resistant; and 15 to 21 mm, moderately susceptible (indeterminate). these data and cross-resistance studies with other newer cephalosporins indicate marked similarity of in vitro activity within this group of drugs, particularly between cefmenoxime, moxalactam, and cefotaxime. any one of these could serve as the representative for the disk diffusion testing of this group of drugs if comparable minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints were used for each drug.

TI  == moxalactam therapy for bacterial infections.
AB  == moxalactam, a novel beta-lactam antimicrobial agent in which oxygen has replaced  sulfur in the six-membered ring of the conventional cephem nucleus, has in vitro  activity against almost all commonly isolated bacterial pathogens including staphylococcus aureus, the enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and haemophilus influenzae. the clinical efficacy an toxicity of moxalactam alone was evaluated in the treatment of 100 infections, including 22 septicemias. thirty-two infections involved p aeruginosa, while organisms resistant to one or more of the currently available cephalosporins or cefoxitin were isolated from cultures in 63 of the cases. the overall clinical response was favorable (infection cured or improved) in 86% of the infections. a  child with klebsiella pneumoniae ventriculitis and meningitis was cured with intravenous moxalactam alone. six of 14 treatment failures involved p. aeruginosa, and p aeruginosa isolates resistant to moxalactam emerged during therapy of 12 infections. side effects, usually mild diarrhea, occurred in only 8.8% of the patients. except for some severe p aeruginosa infections outside the  urinary tract, moxalactam is effective and safe single-agent therapy for infections caused by susceptible organisms and represents a major advancement in  beta-lactam antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == ceftazidime: in-vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility to beta-lactamases compared with that of cefotaxime, moxalactam and other beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of ceftazidime was assessed against recent clinical isolates of common bacteria and also against reference strains that produced known beta-lactamases. the compound was active, though less so than cephaloridine against staphylococci and streptococci with mics mostly 0.12-2 mg/l for streptococci and 8 mg/l for staphylococci, but enterococci (mics > or =64 mg/l) and methicillin-resistant staphylococci (mics 16-32 mg/l) were resistant. penicillin-resistant pneumococci (mics 2-4 mg/l) were much less sensitive than other pneumococci (mics 0.12-0.25 mg/l). ceftazidime was also active, but slightly less so than cefotaxime or moxalactam, against enterobacteria (mics mostly 0.12-0.25 mg/l). its activity was also inferior to that of cefotaxime against neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly 0.03-0.06 mg/l) and haemophilus influenzae (mics mostly 0.06-0.25 mg/l). however it was about eightfold more active than cefotaxime or moxalactam against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mics mostly  1-4 mg/l), and it was also more active than these compounds against other pseudomonads. ceftazidime was less active than cefoxitin against bacteroides spp. (mics mostly 16-64 mg/l for bact. fragilis and 2-8 mg/l for other bacteroides) and less active than ampicillin or cefoxitin against other anaerobes. the compound was highly resistant to hydrolysis by most beta-lactamases including oxa-1 and the enzymes from klebsiella 1082e and proteus vulgaris pc37 which hydrolyse cefuroxime and cefotaxime. however, it was hydrolysed slowly by the enzyme from a highly ampicillin-resistant isolate of bact. fragilis.

AB  == a 4-h micro-id technique for direct identification of oxidase-negative gram-negative rods from positive blood cultures was compared to subculture and species identification of single colonies by api 20e and micro-id, using standardized inocula. a total of 127 patients (220 positive cultures) were studied. isolates included 96 escherichia coli, 46 klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 klebsiella oxytoca, 8 enterobacter aerogenes, 17 enterobacter cloacae, 19 serratia marcescens, 2 serratia liquefaciens, 8 proteus mirabilis, 1 salmonella species, 1 morganella morganii, 6 haemophilus influenzae, 2 haemophilus parainfluenzae, 3 bacteroides fragilis, 3 acinetobacter calcoaceticus biotype anitratus, and 1 pseudomonas maltophilia. in 90% of the cultures, identification  by micro-id was identical to that obtained after subculture; if the 15 non-enterobacterial isolates were excluded, the corresponding figure was 96.6%. enterobacteria identified incorrectly by direct micro-id were three s. marcescens (two identified as s. liquefaciens, one as hafnia alvei), two s. liquefaciens (both identified as e. cloacae), and two k. pneumoniae (one identified as klebsiella ozaenae, the other as serratia rubidaea). none of the 15 non-enterobacterial cultures were correctly identified by micro-id (non-identifiable, or classified as providencia/yersinia/klebsiella species). although biochemical discrepancies between direct and final micro-id tests occurred in 41% of the enterobacterial cultures, this did not seriously interfere with identification. direct species identification of enterobacteriaceae from blood cultures by direct micro-id is accurate and easily performed and identified organisms within 4 h compared to at least 24 h by most other methods; the direct  micro-id technique would be rendered even more valuable by the additional capability of identifying non-enterobacterial gram-negative isolates.

TI  == comparative in vitro appraisal of piperacillin, including its activity against salmonella typhi.
AB  == piperacillin was evaluated in vitro against 711 clinical isolates of aerobic and  anerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including 76 isolates of salmonella typhi. piperacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were compared with those of a range of beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and other antimicrobial agents, and inoculum size effects were considered. the relationship between dilution and disk diffusion tests was studied by regression analysis. in addition, piperacillin was assessed  in combination with aminoglycoside and other beta-lactam drugs. this investigation has confirmed the activity of piperacillin against a broad range of bacteria, including pseudomonas, enterobacteriaceae, neisseria, beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus as well as enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, and other anaerobes. all strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by </=32 mug/ml or less, demonstrating again the potential usefulness of piperacillin in the treatment of pseudomonal infections. s. typhi proved susceptible to piperacillin, all isolates being inhibited by 1 mug/ml. inoculum size experiments showed that inocula of 10(8) cfu resulted in mics and mbcs appreciably higher than those resulting from inocula of 10(6) cfu, and inocula of 10(2) cfu resulted in mics and mbcs appreciably lower than those resulting from inocula of 10(4) cfu. piperacillin was active against all gentamicin-resistant pseudomonads tested, but not against gentamicin-resistant klebsiellas and enterobacters. combinations of piperacillin  with tobramycin and amikacin were consistently synergistic against pseudomonas and serratia isolates. less consistent results were shown when piperacillin was combined with aminoglycosides or cephalothin against klebsiella and indole-positive proteus isolates, although synergy was observed in most cases. occasional antagonistic reactions were encountered with piperacillin-cephalothin  or piperacillin-tobramycin combinations against the latter isolates.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity and susceptibility of the cephalosporin ro 13-9904 to beta-lactamases.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ro 13-9904 was assessed against clinical isolated of common bacteria. its activity against most enterobacteria was similar to that of  cefotaxime and moxalactam, but it was even more active than these compounds against all proteus species. it was also highly active against haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including beta-lactamase producers. like cefotaxime and moxalactam, or 13-9904 was approximately eightfold more active than carbenicillin against most isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and also active against highly carbenicillin-resistant isolates, but it was relatively inactive against moderately carbenicillin-resistant isolates. ro 13-9904 also resembled cefotaxime and moxalactam in that it was active, though less so than cephaloridine, against staphylococci and streptococci, except for methicillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococcus faecalis, which were resistant to it. it was less active than cefoxitin but slightly more active than  ampicillin against both bacteroides fragilis and other bacteroides spp. ro 13-9904 was resistant to most beta-lactamases but was attacked by enzymes from b. fragilis, isolates of indole-positive proteus species, and also by a cefoxitin-hydrolyzing enzyme from an isolate of enterobacter cloacae.

AB  == cp-45,899 is a new, semisynthetic beta-lactamase inhibitor. when tested alone, cp-45,899 displayed only weak antibacterial activity, with the notable exception  of its potent action against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant neisseria gonorrhoeae. a combination of 3.12 microgram of cp-45,899 per ml with 3.12 microgram of ampicillin per ml, tested in broth cultures, inhibited ca. 90% of resistant staphylococcus and haemophilus influenzae strains; similar data were obtained in a variety of media. the same combination of cp-45,899 with ampicillin or penicillin g inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis as interpreted from agar dilution minimal inhibitory concentrations. inhibitory concentrations of cp-45,899-ampicillin were bactericidal against h. influenzae strains and were as  bactericidal as nafcillin or cephalothin against s. aureus. ampicillin-resistant  s. aureus, h. influenzae, and b. fragilis strains did not develop resistance to cp-45,899-ampicillin when transferred as many as six passages in the presence of  a sublethal concentration of the combination.

TI  == moxalactam (6059-s), a novel 1-oxa-beta-lactam with an expanded antibacterial spectrum: laboratory evaluation.
AB  == moxalactam (6059-s) {7beta-[2-carboxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]-7alpha-methoxy-3-[[(1-methyl-1h-t etrazol-5-yl)thio]-methyl]-1-oxa-1-dethia-3-cephem-4- carboxylic acid disodium salt} is a new semisynthetic 1-oxa-beta-lactam derivative for parenteral use. it  was highly active against a broad range of gram-negative microorganisms, including those resistant to other cephalosporins. moreover, it had widely expanded antibacterial spectra which included haemophilus influenzae, indole-positive proteus, enterobacter, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacteroides fragilis. when a large number of clinical isolates of the above-named bacilli were tested by the agar dilution method, using an inoculum size of one loopful of 10(6) or 10(8) organisms or both per ml, the 70%  minimal inhibitory concentrations at the lower inoculum were 0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8,  25, and 0.8 mug/ml, respectively. its activity appeared to be independent of inoculum size and addition of serum. in these organisms, morphological response of the exposed cells revealed that the bacteriolytic effect of 6059-s was initiated by a concentration equivalent to the minimal inhibitory concentration.  6059-s was markedly bactericidal to both beta-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing strains of escherichia coli; this was well reflected by its extraordinary stability to microbial beta-lactamase degradation. administered subcutaneously in mice, 6059-s attained plasma levels and a half-life similar to  those of cefazolin and exhibited potent protective efficacy against systemic infections; it also proved to be significantly more effective than either sulbenicillin or piperacillin against pseudomonas aeruginosa and than either cefazolin or cefmetazole against a variety of other gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == in vitro studies of moxalactam (ly127935), a new beta-lactam antibiotic with significant activity against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == moxalactam (ly127935) is a new beta-lactam antibiotic which is chemically related to the cephalosporins. the agent is highly active against the enterobacteriaceae, with most organisms sensitive to 0.1 mcg/ml or less. it is also active at low concentration against gentamicin-resistant strains of providencia and serratia. minimal inhibitory concentrations of moxalactam for pseudomonas aeruginosa are approximately four-fold lower than those of carbenicillin for the same isolates.  it is highly active against hemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains, with all strains tested sensitive to 0.1 mcg/ml or less. the majority of strains of neisseria gonorrheae and neisseria meningitidis are sensitive to 0.1 mcg/ml or less. moxalactam is more active against bacteroides fragilis than cefoxitin. however, activity of moxalactam against gram-positive cocci was uniformly less than cephalothin and other cephalosporins tested. little effect of inoculum size was observed with moxalactam except for particular strains of gram-negative bacilli. the drug was found to be 40-43% bound to human serum proteins.

TI  == ly-127935: a novel beta-lactam antibiotic with unusual antibacterial activity.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ly-127935, a new beta-lactam antibiotic, was examined by using 370 clinical bacterial strains. in comparison with several other beta-lactam agents, ly-127935 was the most inhibitory against the enterobacteriaceae. it was remarkably active against multi-drug-resistant strains of enterobacter spp., serratia spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa. ly-127935 had four- to eightfold greater activity than did cefoxitin against bacteroides fragilis. production of beta-lactamase by enterobacteriaceae did not influence the minimal inhibitory concentration of ly-127935. however, the beta-lactamase-producing strains of b. fragilis and haemophilus influenzae had generally higher minimal inhibitory concentrations. ly-127935 was the least active agent tested against gram-positive aerobic cocci. variations in ph, salt content, protein content, or inocula size had little influence on susceptibility  to ly-127935. although combination studies with ly-127935 and gentamicin demonstrated synergy for p. aeruginosa, the rates of killing for the combination  and for gentamicin alone were similar.

TI  == development of a lysis-filtration blood culture technique.
AB  == a lysed-blood culture system that quickly lyses patients' blood near neutrality and is relatively noninjurious to more delicate pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae and bacteroides fragilis is reported. the lysing solution includes culture medium, 0.004 m sodium carbonate and bicarbonate, 0.04% triton x-100,and  0.6% rhozyme (a mixture of proteases). most of the pathogens tested multiplied in the lysing solution. the lysed blood normally is immediately filtered. the membrane is transferred to culture broth. the greatest advantage realized from this blood culture technique is separation of pathogens from antibiotics, bactericidal antibodies, complement, opsonins, and phagocytic systems. another advantage is the concentration of organisms into a small volume of clear medium for faster growth and visualization of growth. it was observed that both gram-negative and -positive organisms were attracted during filtration to the filter material and were not removed from it by backwashing with buffer. thus, filter membranes with porosities much larger than would nominally be expected to  retain bacteria retained all or part of light and heavy escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus suspensions. advantage may be taken of this phenomenon to use filters with larger pore sizes and avoid filter clogging by poorly lysed specimens. porr lysis may result from addition of too much blood to the lysing solution, blood with elevated numbers of erythrocytes or leukocytes, or blood from some people whose blood is naturally more resistant to lysis.

TI  == the effect of carbon dioxide on the sensitivity of bacteroides fragilis to certain antibiotics in vitro.
AB  == the effect of 10% carbon dioxide on the sensitivity to four antibiotics of 10 strains of bacteroides fragilis was studied. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of erythromycin and lincomycin hydrochloride for these strains were four to 32 times higher, when grown in hydrogen plus 10% carbon dioxide, than the values obtained when the strains were grown in pure hydrogen. a similar  effect was obtained by growing the strains in hydrogen on an acid medium. except  for haemophilus influenzae and clostridium tertium the sensitivity to erythromycin and lincomycin hydrochloride of other species of bacteria examined was not affected by the atmosphere in which the tests were carried out. 7-chlorolincomycin and rifamycin b diethylamide, to which the strains of b. fragilis were uniformly sensitive, were not significantly affected by additional  carbon dioxide. the possible mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and its clinical implications are discussed, and a case report describing the successful  use of erythromycin in the treatment of a cerebral abscess due to b. fragilis is  presented. in a recent study in this laboratory of the sensitivity to antibiotics of b. fragilis the majority of strains were found to be inhibited by 0.15 mug/ml  of erythromycin and by 0.55 mug/ml of lincomycin hydrochloride (ingham, selkon, codd, and hale, 1968). after this work had been completed hydrogen plus 10% carbon dioxide was substituted for pure hydrogen in the anaerobic technique. strains of b. fragilis isolated on routine culture now appeared to be relatively  resistant to erythromycin and lincomycin hydrochloride when their sensitivity was examined by the disc diffusion method. a more detailed investigation of this phenomenon was carried out, the results of which are reported here. the opportunity was also taken to examine the susceptibility of b. fragilis to two new antibiotics, namely, 7-chlorolincomycin and rifamycin b diethylamide.
