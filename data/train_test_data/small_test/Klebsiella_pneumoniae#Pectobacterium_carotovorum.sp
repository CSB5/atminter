TI  == novel low-temperature-active phytase from erwinia carotovora var.carotovota accc  10276.
AB  == a phytase with high activity at low temperatures has great potential for feed applications, especially in aquaculture. therefore, this study used a degenerate  pcr and tail pcr to clone a phytase gene from erwinia carotovora var. carotovota, the cause of soft rot of vegetables in the ground or during cold storage. the full-length 2.5-kb fragment included an open reading frame of 1,302 bp and encoded a putative phytase of 45.3 kda with a 50% amino acid identity to the klebsiella pneumoniae phytase. the phytase contained the active site rhgxrxp and  hd sequence motifs that are typical of histidine acid phosphatases. the enzyme was expressed in escherichia coli, purified, and displayed the following characteristics: a high catalytic activity at low temperatures (retaining over 24% activity at 5 degrees c) and remarkably thermal lability (losing >96% activity after incubation at 60 degrees c for 2 min). the optimal phytase activity occurred at ph 5.5 and approximately 40 degrees c, and the enzyme activity rapidly decreased above 40 degrees c. when compared with mesophilic counterparts, the phytase not only exhibited a high activity at a low temperature, but also had a low k(m) and high k(cat). these temperature characteristics and kinetic parameters are consistent with low-temperature-active enzymes. to our knowledge, this would appear to be the first report of a low-temperature-active phytase and its heterogeneous expression.

TI  == ahld, an n-acylhomoserine lactonase in arthrobacter sp., and predicted homologues in other bacteria.
AB  == quorum sensing is a signalling mechanism that controls diverse biological functions, including virulence, via n-acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) signal molecules in gram-negative bacteria. with the aim of isolating strains or enzymes capable of blocking quorum sensing by inactivating ahl, bacteria were screened for ahl degradation by their ability to utilize n-3-oxohexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (ohhl) as the sole carbon source. among four isolates, strain ibn110, identified as arthrobacter sp., was found to grow rapidly on ohhl, and to degrade various ahls with different lengths and acyl side-chain substitutions. co-culture of arthrobacter sp. ibn110 and the plant pathogen erwinia carotovora significantly reduced both the ahl amount and pectate lyase activity in co-culture medium, suggesting the possibility of applying arthrobacter sp. ibn110 in the control of ahl-producing pathogenic bacteria. the ahld gene from arthrobacter sp. ibn110 encoding the enzyme catalysing ahl degradation was cloned, and found to encode a protein of 273 amino acids. a mass spectrometry analysis showed that ahld probably hydrolyses the lactone ring of n-3-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone, indicating that ahld is an n-acylhomoserine lactonase (ahlase). a comparison of ahld with other known ahl-degrading enzymes,  bacillus sp. 240b1 aiia, a bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kyushuensis aiia homologue and agrobacterium tumefaciens attm, revealed 25, 26 and 21 % overall identities, respectively, in the deduced amino acid sequences. although these identities were relatively low, the hxdh approximately h approximately d motif was conserved in all the ahlases, suggesting that this motif is essential for ahlase activity. from a genome database search based on the conserved motif, putative ahld-like lactonase genes were found in several other bacteria, and ahl-degrading activities were observed in klebsiella pneumoniae and bacillus stearothermophilus. furthermore, it was verified that ahlk, an ahld homologue, encodes an ahl-degrading enzyme in k. pneumoniae. accordingly, the current results suggest the possibility that ahld-like ahlases could exist in many other  micro-organisms.

TI  == nkbor, a mini-tn10-based transposon for random insertion in the chromosome of gram-negative bacteria and the rapid recovery of sequences flanking the insertion sites in escherichia coli.
AB  == we have constructed an r6k-based suicide vector that permits the random insertion of a mini-transposon named nkbor into the chromosome of gram-negative bacteria and the subsequent rapid cloning of sequences flanking the insertion site in escherichia coli. this mini-transposon contains a conditional r6k plasmid origin  of replication, a kanamycin resistance gene and unique restriction sites between  the is10 inverted repeats. nkbor can be propagated by replication in an e. coli strain containing the r6k replicase pi protein. alternatively the mini-transposon can be replicated in a psc 101 derivative that is thermosensitive for its replication so that the mini-transposon acts as a suicide plasmid at nonpermissive temperatures. efficient nkbor transposition is ensured by expression of an adjacent transposase gene and has been demonstrated in e. coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, and erwinia carotovora. sequences flanking the insertion sites in these strains can be rapidly recovered and identified in e. coli strains expressing the r6k pi protein.

TI  == identification and characterization of the fis operon in enteric bacteria.
AB  == the small dna binding protein fis is involved in several different biological processes in escherichia coli. it has been shown to stimulate dna inversion reactions mediated by the hin family of recombinases, stimulate integration and excision of phage lambda genome, regulate the transcription of several different  genes including those of stable rna operons, and regulate the initiation of dna replication at oric. fis has also been isolated from salmonella typhimurium, and  the genomic sequence of haemophilus influenzae reveals its presence in this bacteria. this work extends the characterization of fis to other organisms. very  similar fis operon structures were identified in the enteric bacteria klebsiella  pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, erwinia carotovora, and proteus vulgaris but not in several nonenteric bacteria. we found that the deduced amino acid sequences for fis are 100% identical in k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, e. coli, and s. typhimurium and 96 to 98% identical when e. carotovora and p. vulgaris fis are considered. the deduced amino acid sequence for h. influenzae fis is about 80% identical and 90% similar to fis in enteric bacteria. however, in spite of these  similarities, the e. carotovora, p. vulgaris, and h. influenzae fis proteins are  not functionally identical. an open reading frame (orf1) preceding fis in e. coli is also found in all these bacteria, and their deduced amino acid sequences are also very similar. the sequence preceding orf1 in the enteric bacteria showed a very strong similarity to the e. coli fis p region from -53 to +27 and the region around -116 containing an ihf binding site. both beta-galactosidase assays and primer extension assays showed that these regions function as promoters in vivo and are subject to growth phase-dependent regulation. however, their promoter strengths vary, as do their responses to fis autoregulation and integration host  factor stimulation.
