TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from sour congee in inner mongolia of china.
AB  == sour congee is a popular food in the western regions of inner mongolia in china.  it has a complex microbial population, which contributes to its unique flavor and functional properties. in this study, we chose 28 sour congee samples that were collected from different areas in inner mongolia for analysis of the microbial community of lactic acid bacteria (lab) by classical biochemical tests, 16s rrna  gene sequencing, multiplex pcr assay of reca gene and restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis of the tuf gene (encoding elongation factor tu). the results revealed that all the isolates were identified as lactobacillus (l.) paracasei (38 strains), l. fermentum (28 strains), l. plantarum (7 strains), l. brevis (4 strains), l. reuteri (2 strains), l. amylolyticus (1 strain), enterococcus (e.) faecalis (3 strains), e. italicus (2 strains) or lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (1 strain). the predominant lab were l. casei and l. fermentum in sour congee samples. the diversity of lab derived from sour congee could offer useful information for further research on sour congee, and the results demonstrated that the combination of tuf gene and rflp patterns can be considered as a useful tool for differentiation of the l. casei group.
