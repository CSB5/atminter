TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == evaluation of the etest for antimicrobial spectrum and potency determinations of  anaerobes associated with bacterial vaginosis and peritonitis.
AB  == one hundred ninety-seven anaerobic organisms (24 gardnerella vaginalis, 16 mobiluncus spp., 19 peptostreptococcus spp., 20 lactobacillus spp., 20 prevotella bivia/disiens, 81 bacteroides fragilis group, 12 clostridium spp., and five fusobacterium spp.) were processed by the etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) and a reference (brucella blood agar) method against 10 antimicrobial agents. for the bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens, the etest was more reproducible and correlated acceptably with the reference agar test: within +/- 1 log2 dilution for 74.4% of mobiluncus spp. to 96.0% for peptostreptococcus spp. (all organisms, 83.4%). the quantitative correlation +/- 2 log2 dilution steps between test results was 94.3%. results with b. fragilis group strains demonstrated 97.3% correlation (+/- 2 log2 dilution) with a trend toward slightly lower etest minimum inhibitory concentrations for ampicillin-sulbactam, cefotaxime, imipenem, and clindamycin. the absolute qualitative interpretive agreement between etest and the reference agar dilution method results was 94.4%, with only a 0.4% false-susceptible error rate. the etest appears to be a very practical, quantitatively accurate, alternative procedure for clinical microbiology laboratories routinely testing the susceptibilities of anaerobes and, by these presented data, organisms associated with female tract infections.

TI  == the normal vaginal flora, h2o2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  == in this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (bv) on the basis of a vaginal smear. bv was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. h2o2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with bv, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and  61% of those with a normal flora. h2o2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. the microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with bv included gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia/disiens, bacteroides ureolyticus, prevotella corporis/bacteroides levii, fusobacterium nucleatum, mobiluncus species, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus tetradius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, ureaplasma urealyticum, and mycoplasma hominis (p < .05 for each).  the presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by h2o2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were b. ureolyticus,  f. nucleatum, and p. prevotii. other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without bv. we conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with bv in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with bv and those inhibited by h2o2-producing lactobacilli.
