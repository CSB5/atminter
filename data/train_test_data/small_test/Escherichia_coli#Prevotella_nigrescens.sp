TI  == the gene coding for nigrescin produced by prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261.
AB  == aim: to identify the gene that encodes nigrescin, a bacteriocin produced by prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261. methods and results: each open reading frame (orf) of the nig gene cluster (niga, nigb, nigc and nigd) was transferred into an expression vector. the recombinant proteins encoded by niga, nigb, nigc and nigd  were purified and assayed for bacteriocin activity against porphyromonas gingivalis. the orfs of the nig gene cluster in pr. nigrescens atcc 25261 were re-analysed. it revealed that the position of nig orfs was similar to previously  designated locations, except that the start codon of nigc was reassigned. the new nigc gene started at the nucleotide base position 2454 and stopped at position 3608 (the position designated is relative to the first nucleotide base of the nig locus) and putatively encoded a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 41.9 kda. the n-terminal 6xhistidine-tag recombinant proteins of niga, nigb, nigc and  nigd were overexpressed in escherichia coli bl21 star (de3) and were purified using ni-nta resins. only recombinant nigc showed inhibitory activity against p.  gingivalis a244 with minimal inhibition concentration (mic) of 40 microg ml(-1).  conclusion: these results indicate that nigc is the gene that encodes nigrescin.  significance and impact of the study: this is the first report that indicates that the gene nigc codes for nigrescin, a bacteriocin produced by pr. nigrescens  atcc 25261.

TI  == effect of calcium hydroxide-treated prevotella nigrescens on the gene expression  of matrix metalloproteinase and its inhibitor in mg63 cells.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to monitor the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (mmp-1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (timp-1)  produced by an osteoblastic cell line mg63 stimulated with prevotella nigrescens  lipopolysaccharides (lps), and to compare the level of secretion before and after the p. nigrescens lps was treated with calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2]. the underlying hypothesis is that the balance between mmp and timp secretion is the key to an understanding of the host degradative pathways involved in the pathogenesis of bacterial derived pulpal and periapical diseases. confluent monolayers of mg63 human osteosarcoma cells were exposed to varying concentrations of p. nigrescens or escherichia coli lps. alternately, confluent cultures were exposed to 10 microg/ml of bacterial lps pretreated with ca(oh)2 (12.5 mg/ml) for 72 hours. at the end of the experimental period, total rna was extracted and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed for mmp-1, timp-1, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh). the results showed that the expression of mmp-1 mrna was low and invariant for the experimental period in the negative controls. however, exposure to p. nigrescens lps increased expression after 48 hours. expression of timp-1 mrna was highly increased at 24 and 48 hours with lower concentrations of lps in  contrast to a suppression with a concentration of 10 microg/ml. treatment of p. nigrescens lps with ca(oh)2 resulted in a down-regulation of mmp-1, whereas pretreated e. coli lps demonstrated no stimulatory activity for mmp-1 gene expression. both types of lps when pretreated with ca(oh)2 induced slightly up-regulated expression of timp-1.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of candida albicans biofilms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro candida albicans biofilm development. a single isolate of c. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species  of oral bacteria comprising, actinomyces israelii, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. a viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on candida biofilm formation. co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (p<0.05), except for l. acidophilus, s. mutans, and, s. intermedius co-cultures. further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration  of either p. gingivalis or e. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (p<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate c. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.

TI  == characterization of minimal bacteriocin operon from prevotella nigrescens atcc 25261.
AB  == aims: to characterize a minimal bacteriocin operon of prevotella nigrescens atcc  25261. methods and results: a genomic dna library of pr. nigrescens atcc 25261 was constructed and screened for bacteriocin production by an agar overlay assay. sequence analysis of the bacteriocin-producing recombinant plasmid, pgp2, has shown that the insert dna consists of 4868 base pairs, termed nig locus. there is a cluster of four genes within the nig locus, respectively designated niga, b, c  and d. deleting 160 nucleotides at the 3'-end of nigab resulted in loss of bacteriocin production, indicating that nigab may belong to a bacteriocin operon. niga is thought to be the bacteriocin gene, while nigb may encode an immunity protein. escherichia coli containing pgp2 expressed the bacteriocin, which is similar in size, antimicrobial activity, and biochemical properties to that purified from pr. nigrescens atcc 25261. conclusion: nig locus is a chromosomal fragment of pr. nigrescens atcc 25261, consisting of 4868 base pairs, and has been proved to be important for bacteriocin production. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report of the successful cloning and expression of the bacteriocin from pr. nigrescens atcc 25261 into e. coli. this will facilitate the construction of bacteriocin analogues and permit investigation of  their structure/function relationships.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == possible potentiation of toxins from prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and porphyromonas gingivalis by cotinine.
AB  == background: smoking is a recognized risk factor for the initiation and progression of periodontitis. however, the mechanism by which smoking induces its negative effects on the periodontium is not clear. this study aimed to test the hypothesis that synergy may occur between cotinine and bacterial products isolated from 3 putative periodontopathogens. methods: a chick embryo toxin assay was used to investigate bacterial toxins (cell-free extracellular toxins and cell-free cell lysates) from 5 species with and without cotinine. a total of 9 putative periodontopathogens (3 species) and 2 non-oral controls (2 species) were studied. the periodontal species were: prevotella intermedia (n = 4), prevotella  nigrescens (n = 4), and porphyromonas gingivalis (n = 1). the control species tested were: staphylococcus aureus (n = 1) and escherichia coli (n = 1). results: the toxicity kill was significantly greater than expected by simple addition alone (p <0.05, fisher's exact test) between cotinine (800 ng/ml) and 1) the cell-free extracellular toxins of p. nigrescens mh1 and 2) the cell-free cell lysates of p. intermedia mh2. synergy occurred with cotinine plus the cell-free extracellular toxins in all but 3 periodontal isolates, and the cell-free cell lysates in all but 2 periodontal isolates. cotinine significantly (p <0.05, fisher's exact test) enhanced the effects of cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates from one control species (e. coli), but not the other (s. aureus). conclusions: these findings indicate that synergy in an in vitro assay can occur  between cotinine and toxins from putative periodontopathogens. this may be one important mechanism by which smoking increases the severity of periodontitis.

TI  == purification and functional analysis of the dnak homologue from prevotella intermedia omz 326.
AB  == this study examined heat shock proteins (hsps) of the periodontal pathogen prevotella intermedia and the closely related species, prevotella nigrescens and  prevotella corporis. after heat shock at 45 degrees c for 5 min, cell-free extracts were analysed by sds-page and western blotting with polyclonal antibodies against escherichia coli hsps. p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and p. corporis all expressed a dnak homologue. the p. nigrescens dnak was of a similar  molecular mass to e. coli dnak (70 kda), whilst those of p. intermedia and p. corporis were approximately 69 kda. dnaj homologues were expressed in each species; however, no homologue of grpe was detected. p. intermedia dnak was purified to homogeneity by ion-exchange and affinity-chromatography, and was shown to restore activity of denatured luciferase. this molecular chaperone activity was enhanced by e. coli dnaj and grpe which are components of the hsp70  molecular chaperone machine.

TI  == ribotyping of bacteria from root canal and blood of patients receiving endodontic therapy.
AB  == dna restriction patterns and corresponding ribotypes of 26 bacterial isolates (propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis) recovered from patients with infected root canals and their peripheral blood, collected during and after endodontic therapy, were examined. eleven additional reference strains including type strains were also examined. purified dna was digested with bgli,ecori, and hindiii. hybridization was carried out with a digoxigenin-labeled cdna probe obtained by reverse transcription of escherichia coli 16s + 23s rrna. ribotypes of the bacteria recovered from root canal and blood showed identical characteristics within the patients, and differed between the patients. the results were confirmed when the similarity coefficient (s(ab)) of the ribotypes from the isolates were assessed by the dendron computer-assisted system. these results suggested that the bacteria isolated from the blood originated from the root canal.

TI  == extracts of periodontopathic microorganisms lack functional superantigenic activity for murine t cells.
AB  == products of periodontopathic bacteria exert immunomodulatory effects on various lymphoid cell populations, some of which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. it has recently been suggested that some of these bacterial products may possess superantigenic (sag) activity. sag bind simultaneously to the v beta chain of t cell receptors and to class ii major histocompatibility complex molecules, thereby activating as many as 35% of t cells to proliferate and produce cytokines. in order to examine this question, the proliferation of splenic and thymic t cells from immunologically naive, 3-6-wk-old balb/c (h-2d),  c57bl/6 (h-2b) and c3h/hej (h-2k) mice was assessed in response to sonic extracts of periodontopathogens. laboratory and/or reference strains of a.o. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens were used as stimulants. staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb), a known superantigen, was utilized as a positive control. unfractionated spleen cells responded to several of the tested preparations of the different bacteria, as well as to seb, con a and escherichia coli lps. thymocytes responded to con a and seb, but not to lps or to any sonic extract. spleen cells depleted of b cells by panning responded to seb and con a, but not to lps and showed a reduced response to sonicates. the residual response of b cell-depleted spleen cells was reduced essentially to background by treatment with anti-thy 1.2 + c'. similar results were obtained in the presence of 5% added mitomycin-treated antigen presenting cells, indicating that these cells were not  limiting. these results demonstrate that extracts of periodontopathic bacteria do not stimulate murine t cells in a manner consistent with superantigenic activation.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide increases cell surface-associated fibronectin in fibroblasts in vitro.
AB  == this study assessed the fibronectin expression by fibroblasts derived from noninflamed and inflamed gingiva by measuring the amount of cell surface-associated fibronectin and fibronectin released into the medium. the effects of added lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens and escherichia coli on both types of fibroblasts were also studied. in the absence of lipopolysaccharide, the amounts of the two types of fibronectin were significantly larger in the fibroblasts from inflamed than from noninflamed  gingiva. the specific lipopolysaccharide had no effect on the amount of fibronectin released into the medium by either fibroblast type. the amount of cell surface-associated fibronectin increased significantly when lipopolysaccharide (0.1 and 1 microgram/ml) was added to the cells from the noninflamed gingiva (the effect was evident in the order: p. gingivalis>p.nigrescens>e. coli). lipopolysaccharide from p. gingivalis significantly increased the cell surface-associated fibronectin even at a low concentration of lipopolysaccharide (0.01 microgram/ml). in fibroblasts from the  inflamed gingiva, only the lipopolysaccharide from p. gingivalis was effective in increasing the amount of cell surface-associated fibronectin. our findings showed that the fibronectin expression was increased in the fibroblasts from inflamed gingiva and that lipopolysaccharide from p. gingivalis increased the cell surface-associated fibronectin.

TI  == identification of a chromosomally encoded kanamycin acetylase in porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == sonic extracts from the test strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens were tested for the ability to inactivate kanamycin sulfate in the presence of atp or acetyl coenzyme a (acetyl-coa). residual kanamycin activity was determined by a bio-assay using escherichia coli  jm109 as the assay organism. sonic extracts of all test strains of p. gingivalis  inactivated kanamycin. all strains tested in this study required the presence of  acetyl-coa for inactivation, indicating that inactivation was by acetylation. the gene of a kanamycin-inactivating protein from p. gingivalis 16-1 was cloned into  e. coli utilizing the plasmid vector ptz18r. the resultant kanamycin-resistant clone, harboring plasmid ppg16 with a p. gingivalis insert, expressed a kanamycin-inactivating activity, which was enhanced by the addition of acetyl-coa, confirming that the kanamycin was inactivated by acetylation. southern blot analysis indicates that the gene was conserved among all p. gingivalis strains tested.

TI  == effects of cytokines and periodontopathic bacteria on the leukocyte function-associated antigen 1/intercellular adhesion molecule 1 pathway in gingival fibroblasts in adult periodontitis.
AB  == we investigated the effects of inflammatory cytokines and periodontopathic bacteria on expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and e-selectin (endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1) in cultured human gingival fibroblasts (hgf). cell surface icam-1 was upregulated on hgf under transcriptional control by exposure not only to interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and gamma interferon but also to sonic extracts prepared from porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia (nigrescens) and lipopolysaccharides from escherichia coli. however, these stimuli induced only minimal expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and  e-selectin on hgf. binding assays using hgf and molt 4, the human t-cell leukemia cell line, showed induced icam-1 to be functional, and the increased binding was  blocked by a combination of monoclonal antibodies against icam-1 and leukocyte function-associated antigen 1. furthermore, gingival tissues from adult periodontitis patients showed increased mrna expression of icam-1 compared with that in tissues from normal healthy donors. in immunohistological analysis, we also observed in vivo that the expression of icam-1 on fibroblasts in adult periodontitis tissues was greater than that in normal gingiva. thus, the overexpression of icam-1 on gingival fibroblasts induced by cytokines and periodontopathic bacteria is speculated to be deeply involved in the accumulation and retention of leukocyte function-associated antigen 1-bearing leukocytes in adult periodontitis lesions.
