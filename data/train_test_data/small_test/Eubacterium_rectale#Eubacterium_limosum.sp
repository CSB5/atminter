TI  == immunological specificity of oral eubacterium species.
AB  == antigens of eubacterium species including e. alactolyticum, e. brachy, e. nodatum, e. saburreum, e. timidum, e. yurii subsp. yurii and e. yurii subsp. margaretiae, which have been isolated frequently from periodontal pockets and associated with periodontal diseases, were extracted by ultrasonication from whole bacterial cells. antigens were also prepared from e. aerofaciens, e. lentum and e. rectale, which have been found in intestinal tracts and infected abscesses in human oral cavities. the antigens of the oral eubacterium species were compared with antigens from e. limosum, the type species of the genus eubacterium, by using sds-page and western immunoblot assays. sds-page gels stained with coomassie brilliant blue indicated that no major peptide bands were  common among the eubacterium species examined. the protein profile patterns were  distinctly different from each other. western immunoblotting reactions with rabbit antisera showed that the eubacterium species could be clearly distinguished serologically, and that the species-specific antigens were peptide  components of ultrasonic extracts from the whole bacterial cells. the present study demonstrates that these eubacterium species show great heterogeneity in their peptide components and immunological reactions, which may be useful for identification of the eubacterium species from human oral specimens.

TI  == chronic arthritis induced in rats by cell wall fragments of eubacterium species from the human intestinal flora.
AB  == to investigate arthritis-inducing properties of eubacterium species, which are major residents of the human intestinal flora, cell wall fragments (cwf) of several eubacterium strains were prepared and tested in an animal model. after a  single intraperitoneal injection in the rat, cwf of e. aerofaciens, e. contortum, and e. lentum induced a chronic polyarthritis. e. limosum and e. tortuosum cwf induced an acute self-limiting joint inflammation, whereas e. rectale cwf failed  to do so. the rhamnose contents of the isolated cwf were not related to their arthritis-inducing properties. paradoxically, the sensitivity of cwf to lysozyme  digestion, which is regarded as a parameter for the clearance of cwf in tissues,  appeared to be positively correlated with the ability of eubacterium cwf to induce chronic joint inflammation. our findings show the diversity in arthritis-inducing properties among different species of the anaerobic genus eubacterium and underline the importance of the anaerobic intestinal flora in the induction of joint inflammation.
