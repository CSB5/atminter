##The @MInter bacterial interaction detection system.


###1. Core components


__pretrained SVMs__

data/SVMs/core_trained_svm.p
	pickled SVM object for use in svm_scanner.py.
	Trained on only interactions involving Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus acidophilus
data/SVMs/full_trained_svm.p
	pickled SVM object for use in svm_scanner.py.
	Trained on entire corpus

__SVM Tools__

SVM/svm_scanner.py
	SVM script. Takes in a directory of JSON files (format in 2.) returns a tagged JSON ("ABHT" field) for each file. 1 == interaction detected, 0 == no interaction detected. Refer to script help for more details.
SVM/svm_train.py
	Training script. Takes in an annotated corpus file (.ann), produces a trained, pickled SVM from that corpus. 

__Pattern Scanner__
patternScan/patternScan.py
	Pattern Scanner script. Takes in a directory of JSON files (format in 2.) returns a tagged JSON ("ABHT" field) for each file. If an interaction is detected, a list of all patterns signifying the interaction is inserted into the "ABHT" field. Refer to script help for more details.

__Annotated Corpus__

Annotated abstracts/annotations for @SVM training

/data/train_test_data/lactobacillus_acidophilus#escherichia_coli.ann
	Core dataset

/data/train_test_data/collated_train.ann
	Extended dataset: training ready

/data/train_test_data/collated_annotations.tar.gz
	Extended dataset

###2. Input format

The @MInter system, as input, takes in JSONs of the following format:
**filename:**

Species_1#Species_2.json

**Contents:**

	{"SUMMARY":
		{
			"INT": <bool>, #Interaction between the two species
			"NEG": <bool>, #Negative interaction between the two species
			"POS": <bool>, #Positive interaction between the two species
	}
	{"PAPERS":[			#List of paper dictionaries
		{
			"PMID":<str>,	#Paper PMID
			"TI":<str>,		#Paper Title
			"AB":<str>,		#Paper Abstract
			"TIHT":<str>,	#Depreciated
			"ABHT":<str>,	#Sentenced detected if pattern found (Patternscan); Numeric value depending on interaction (SVM)

			}, 

	]}
