TI  == antimicrobial impacts of essential oils on food borne-pathogens.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of twelve essential oil (pine oil, eucalyptus, thyme,  sage tea, lavender, orange, laurel, lemon, myrtle, lemon, rosemary and juniper) was tested by a disc diffusion method against food borne pathogens (escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus  faecalis, staphylococcus aureus). the major components in essential oils were monoterpenes hydrocarbons, alpha-pinene, limonene; monoterpene phenol, carvacrol  and oxygenated monoterpenes, camphor, 1,8-cineole, eucalyptol, linalool and linalyl acetate. although the antimicrobial effect of essential oils varied depending on the chemical composition of the essential oils and specific microorganism tested, majority of the oils exhibited antibacterial activity against one or more strains. the essential oil with the lowest inhibition zones was juniper with the values varied from 1.5 to 6 mm. however, the components of essential oil of thyme and pine oil are highly active against food borne pathogen, generating the largest inhibition zones for both gram negative and positive bacteria (5.25-28.25 mm vs. 12.5-30 mm inhibition zones). these results  indicate the possibility use of the essential oils on food system as antimicrobial agents against food-borne pathogen. the article also offers some promising patents on applications of essential oils on food industry as antimicrobial agent.

TI  == purification and characterization of a cysteine-rich 14-kda antibacterial peptide from the granular hemocytes of mangrove crab episesarma tetragonum and its antibiofilm activity.
AB  == antimicrobial peptide (amp) crustin is a type of immune molecule present in the immune system of crustaceans and response against microbial invasion. in the present study, we have identified and characterized the cationic, amphipathic structure consisting of amp crustin from a mangrove crab episesarma tetragonum using cm sepharose-based cation exchange column chromatography. e. tetragonum crustin showed a single band of 14 kda on sds-page and the homogeneity showed retention time of 8.4 min in rp-hplc. functional studies of e. tetragonum crustin exhibits the antibacterial activity (2-4 mug/ml) and biofilm inhibition (20 mug/ml) against the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. hydrophobicity and extrapolysaccharide production of gram-positive bacteria were inhibited through the bactericidal inhibitory concentration. in situ visualization analysis of biofilm inhibition was observed through light and  confocal laser scanning microscopy. surface morphology and the bacterial biofilm  inhibition were viewed by scanning electron and atomic force microscopy. this study emphasizes the potential activity of e. tetragonum crustin, an interesting  candidate for the development of novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent against bacterial pathogens. graphical abstract antimicrobial peptide synthesis and host-pathogen interaction lead to production of immune molecules directed to destruction of pathogens.

TI  == telavancin activity tested against gram-positive clinical isolates from european, russian and israeli hospitals (2011-2013) using a revised broth microdilution testing method: redefining the baseline activity of telavancin.
AB  == objectives: to reassess the activity of telavancin when tested against gram-positive clinical pathogens recovered from hospitalized patients in european and adjacent regions using a revised broth microdilution method. methods: 11 601  consecutive, non-duplicate isolates originating from 36 institutions among 18 countries recovered between 2011 and 2013 were tested for susceptibility using a  revised broth microdilution method for telavancin. interpretive telavancin breakpoints appropriate for the method were those recently approved by the fda and eucast, as available. results: telavancin (mic50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) was equally potent against methicillin-susceptible ((mssa) and methicillin-resistant (mrsa) staphylococcus aureus. all enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to telavancin (mic50/90, 0.12/0.12 mg/l) and inhibited at the susceptibility breakpoint (i.e. </= 0.25 mg/l), except for vana-phenotype vancomycin-resistant isolates (telavancin mic, >1 mg/l). telavancin ( </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l) was active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium,  while higher mic values were obtained for vana strains. telavancin (both mic50 and mic90, </= 0.015 mg/l) was potent against streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic50/90, </= 0.015/0.06 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (mic50/90, </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l). conclusions: telavancin exhibited potent activity against this contemporary (2011-2013) collection of organisms, inhibiting indicated pathogens at or below the fda/eucast-approved breakpoints for susceptibility. vana-phenotype enterococci were less susceptible to telavancin, a feature observed using the previous testing method. these results redefine telavancin's activity against isolates from europe.

TI  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of cymbopogon essential oil (lemon grass) and its interaction with silver ions.
AB  == background: it is well known that cymbopogon (lemon grass) essential oil exhibits antimicrobial activity while the efficacy of silver ions as a disinfectant is equally well reported. hypothesis: the antimicrobial activity of ceo and ag(+) and their synergistic combinations will be useful in improving the current treatment strategies for various infections. study design: in the present study,  we determined the chemical composition and in vitro antimicrobial activity of six different cymbopogon essential oils (ceo's) alone and in combination with silver  ions (ag(+)) against two gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis), two gram-negative (escherichia coli and moraxella catarrhalis) and two yeast species (candida albicans and candida tropicalis). the nature of potential  interactions was determined by fractional inhibitory concentration indices (ficis) for ceo's and ag(+) calculated from microdilution assays and time-kill curves. results: gas chromatography-mass spectrometry results confirmed the presence of nerol, geranial and geraniol as major volatile compounds. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values confirmed that all the tested pathogens are variably susceptible to both ceo's as well as ag(+). the mic of ceo's and ag(+) against all the tested pathogens ranged from 0.032 mg/ml to 1 mg/ml and 0.004 and 0.064 mg/ml respectively, whereas when assayed in combination the fici values were drastically reduced to range between 0.258 and 2.186, indicating synergy, additive and indifferent interactions. the most prominent interaction was observed between cymbopogon flexuosus essential oil and ag(+) against c. albicans with summation operatorfic = 0.254. the synergistic interactions were further confirmed through the construction of isobolograms and time-kill plots. transmission electron microscopy showed disturbance in the cell envelope upon the concomitant treatment of ceo's and ag(+), which ultimately leads to cell death. conclusion: results suggest that ceo's and ag(+) when used in combination offers  an opportunity to the formulation scientist to produce novel combinations acting  synergistically in the continued quest to control important infectious pathogens.

TI  == screening currency notes for microbial pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes  using a shotgun metagenomic approach.
AB  == fomites are a well-known source of microbial infections and previous studies have provided insights into the sojourning microbiome of fomites from various sources. paper currency notes are one of the most commonly exchanged objects and its potential to transmit pathogenic organisms has been well recognized. approaches to identify the microbiome associated with paper currency notes have been largely limited to culture dependent approaches. subsequent studies portrayed the use of  16s ribosomal rna based approaches which provided insights into the taxonomical distribution of the microbiome. however, recent techniques including shotgun sequencing provides resolution at gene level and enable estimation of their copy  numbers in the metagenome. we investigated the microbiome of indian paper currency notes using a shotgun metagenome sequencing approach. metagenomic dna isolated from samples of frequently circulated denominations of indian currency notes were sequenced using illumina hiseq sequencer. analysis of the data revealed presence of species belonging to both eukaryotic and prokaryotic genera. the taxonomic distribution at kingdom level revealed contigs mapping to eukaryota (70%), bacteria (9%), viruses and archae (~1%). we identified 78 pathogens including staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium glutamicum, enterococcus faecalis, and 75 cellulose degrading organisms including acidothermus cellulolyticus, cellulomonas flavigena and ruminococcus albus. additionally, 78 antibiotic resistance genes were identified and 18 of these were found in all the samples. furthermore, six out of 78 pathogens harbored at least one of the 18 common antibiotic resistance genes. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of shotgun metagenome sequence dataset of paper currency notes, which can be useful for future applications including as bio-surveillance of exchangeable fomites for infectious agents.

TI  == statins and antimicrobial effects: simvastatin as a potential drug against staphylococcus aureus biofilm.
AB  == statins are important lipid-lowering agents with other pleiotropic effects. several studies have explored a possible protective effect of statins to reduce the morbidity and mortality of many infectious diseases. staphylococcus aureus is one of the main pathogens implicated in nosocomial infections; its ability to form biofilms makes treatment difficult. the present study observed the mic of atorvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin against s. aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. simvastatin was the only  agent with activity against clinical isolates and reference strains of methicilin-sensitive s. aureus (mssa) and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). thus, the effects of simvastatin on the growth, viability and biofilm formation of s. aureus were tested. in addition, a possible synergistic effect between simvastatin and vancomycin was evaluated. simvastatin's mic was 15.65 microg/ml for s. aureus 29213 and 31.25 microg/ml for the other strains of s. aureus. the effect of simvastatin was bactericidal at 4xmic and bacteriostatic at the mic concentration. no synergistic effect was found between simvastatin and vancomycin. however, the results obtained against s. aureus biofilms showed that, in addition to inhibiting adhesion and biofilm formation at concentrations from 1/16xmic to 4xmic, simvastatin was also able to act against mature biofilms, reducing cell viability and extra-polysaccharide production. in conclusion, simvastatin showed pronounced antimicrobial activity against s. aureus biofilms,  reducing their formation and viability.

TI  == analysis of vancomycin susceptibility testing results for presumptive categorization of telavancin.
AB  == scattergrams between vancomycin and telavancin demonstrated susceptibility agreement rates of 99.96, 99.65 and 100.00% for staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and streptococci, respectively. a single very major error was obtained against e. faecalis, while vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), and vancomycin-resistant and teicoplanin-susceptible (vanb-phenotype) e. faecalis were responsible for the major and minor errors. these results support the use of vancomycin to infer telavancin susceptibility among indicated pathogens, except visa, which should be tested for telavancin susceptibility.

TI  == composition and antimicrobial activity of euphrasia rostkoviana hayne essential oil.
AB  == eyebright, euphrasia rostkoviana hayne (scrophulariaceae), is a medicinal plant traditionally used in europe for the treatment of various health disorders, especially as eyewash to treat eye ailments such as conjunctivitis and blepharitis that can be associated with bacterial infections. some euphrasia species have been previously reported to contain essential oil. however, the composition and bioactivity of e. rostkoviana oil are unknown. therefore, in this study, we investigated the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the eyebright essential oil against some organisms associated with eye infections: enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans. gc-ms analysis revealed more than 70 constituents, with n-hexadecanoic acid (18.47%) as the main constituent followed by thymol (7.97%), myristic acid (4.71%), linalool  (4.65%), and anethole (4.09%). the essential oil showed antimicrobial effect against all organisms tested with the exception of p. aeruginosa. the best activity was observed against all gram-positive bacteria tested with the minimum  inhibitory concentrations of 512 microg/ml. this is the first report on the chemical composition of e. rostkoviana essential oil and its antimicrobial activity.

TI  == probiotic features of lactobacillus strains isolated from ragusano and pecorino siciliano cheeses.
AB  == in the present study 177 lactobacillus spp. strains, isolated from ragusano and pecorino siciliano cheeses, were in vitro screened for probiotic traits, and their characteristics were compared to those of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, commercial strain. based on acidic and bile salt resistance, thirteen lactobacillus strains were selected. the multiplex-pcr application revealed that  nine strains belonged to l. rhamnosus species and four to lactobacillus paracasei species. all selected strains were further investigated for transit tolerance in  simulated upper gastrointestinal tract (gi), for adhesion capacity to human intestinal cell lines, for hydrophobicity, for co-aggregation and auto-aggregation and for antimicrobial activities. moreover, antibiotic resistance, hemolytic and bile salt hydrolase activities were investigated for safety assessment. viable counts after simulated gastric and duodenal transit revealed that overall the selected lactobacilli tolerated better pancreatic juice and bile salts than acidic juice. in particular, three l. rhamnosus strains (fs10, fs2, and ps11) and one l. paracasei strain (pm8) increased their cell density after the simulated gi transit. the same strains showed also high percentage of auto-aggregation and co-aggregation with escherichia coli. all strains were effective against both staphylococcus aureus and e. coli and variability was achieved versus listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus faecalis  used as pathogenic indicator strains. different behavior was revealed by strains  for adhesion ability and hydrophobicity, which are not always linked each other and are strongly strain-dependent. from the safety point of view, no isolate showed hemolytic and bile salt hydrolase activities, except one, and most of the  strains were sensitive to a broad range of clinical antibiotics. this work showed that the l. rhamnosus fs10 and the l. paracasei pm8 are good promising probiotic  candidates for further in vivo investigations.

TI  == [bloodstream infections in southwestern china: 2012 whire union report on bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  == objective: to test the susceptibility of blood culture isolates to antibiotics in a sample of hospitals in southwestern china in 2012. methods: blood culture samples were taken and tested from the patients under the whire union surveillance in three tertiary hospitals in southwestern china in 2012. we performed antimicrobial susceptibility analyses on the blood culture isolates using whonet5. 5 and spss19.0. results: a total of 1745 isolates were identified: 877 gram-positive (50.26%); 868 gram-negative (49.74%). coagulase-negative staphylococcius (cns, 541 strains, 31.00%), escherichia coli (eco, 379 strains, 21.72%), klebsiella spp. (170 strains, 9.74%), enterococcus spp. (143 strains, 8.20%) and staphylococcus aureus (sau, 128 strains, 7.34%) comprised the majority of isolates. methicillin-resistant was found in 37.5% of s. aureus and 85.4% of cns, respectively. zero and 6.3% resistance to vancomycin were found for enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, respectively,compared with a 1.4% and 7.9%  resistance to linezolid, respectively. imipenem-resistance occurred in 0.7% e. coli, 3.6% klebsiella spp., and 11.1% enterobacter spp.. nonfermenters were highly resistant to carbapenems, with an imipenem resistance rate of 25.0% in p.  aeruginosa and 79.1% in acinetobacter baumannii. antimicrobial usage and critical-care units were identified as risk factors for mrsa and multi-drug-resistant a. baumannii infections. patients undergoing tracheotomy/endotracheal intubation were likely to develop multi-drug-resistant a. baumannii infections than others. conclusion: cns, e. coli,klebsiella spp., enterococcus spp. and s. aureus were the predominant organisms in bloodstream infections in southwestern china. low methicillin-resistant rate was found in staphylococcus aureus. but vancomycin-resistant rate was high in e. faecium. imipenem-resistant rates varied in enterobacteriaceae: higher in non-fermenting bacteria especially in acinetobacter spp. use of abtimicrobial drugs and invasive procedures can lead to development of antimicrobial drugs-resistance.

TI  == a derivative of the thiopeptide ge2270a highly selective against propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == a chemical derivative of the thiopeptide ge2270a, designated nai003, was found to possess a substantially reduced antibacterial spectrum in comparison to the parent compound, being active against just a few gram-positive bacteria. in particular, nai003 retained low mics against all tested isolates of propionibacterium acnes and, to a lesser extent, against enterococcus faecalis. furthermore, nai003 showed a time- and dose-dependent killing of both a clindamycin-resistant and a clindamycin-sensitive p. acnes isolate. gel-shift experiments indicated that, like the parent compound, nai003 retained the ability to bind to elongation factors (ef) tu derived from escherichia coli, e. faecalis  or p. acnes, albeit with reduced efficiency. in contrast, ef-tu's derived from the nai003-insenstitive staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus pyogenes did not bind this compound. these results were confirmed by in vitro studies using a hybrid translation system, which indicated that nai003 can inhibit most efficiently protein synthesis driven by the p. acnes ef-tu. p. acnes mutants resistant to nai003 were isolated by direct plating. with one exception, all analyzed strains carried mutation in the tuf gene, encoding ef-tu. because of its selective effect on p. acnes in comparison to resident skin flora, nai003 represents a promising candidate for the topical treatment of acne, which has already completed a phase 1 clinical study.

TI  == decade-long use of the antimicrobial peptide combination tyrothricin does not pose a major risk of acquired resistance with gram-positive bacteria and candida  spp.
AB  == tyrothricin, an antimicrobial peptide combination produced by bacillus brevis consisting of gramicidins and tyrocidins commands broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and some yeasts in vitro. the polypeptide and its  components have been used therapeutically for about 60 years in the local treatment of infected skin and infected oro-pharyngeal mucous membranes. though older studies suggest that resistance development of originally susceptible microorganisms towards tyrothricin is a rare event, data concerning recent state  of resistance are lacking. in the present in vitro study the susceptibility to tyrothricin of clinical isolates of bacterial and yeast origin from superficial swabs of the skin and mucous membranes of outpatients and inpatients obtained from clinical material in the second half of the year 2003 was determined. using  a microdilution assay, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic and mic90, defined as the concentration that inhibits at least 90 percent of the tested strains) of 20 strains each of staphylococcus aureus of the variety mssa (susceptible to methicillin), staphylococcus aureus of the variety mrsa (methicillin resistant), staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium spec., candida albicans and candida parapsilosis was determined. all of the tested gram-positive bacteria turned out  to be highly susceptible to tyrothricin with mics </= 4mg/l. the tested yeast strains were susceptible to the polypeptide antibiotic as well, but (with mics of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l, respectively) to a lesser extent. no acquired resistance of  the tested strains was determined, indicating that the risk of resistance development against topically applied tyrothricin is only marginal, if there is any at all. thus, long-term-, i.e. decade-long use of topically applied tyrothricin and its components in the local treatment of infected skin does not pose a major risk with respect to acquired resistance of originally susceptible gram-positive bacteria and yeasts, not even in the case of staphylococcus aureus, both with mssa and mrsa strains. the broad anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity of tyrothricin combined with its lacking risk for resistance development make the antimicrobial peptide a valuable addition to our therapeutic armamentarium in the treatment of infected skin.

TI  == a novel gene, optra, that confers transferable resistance to oxazolidinones and phenicols and its presence in enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium of human and animal origin.
AB  == objectives: the oxazolidinone-resistant enterococcus faecalis e349 from a human patient tested negative for the cfr gene and 23s rrna mutations. here we report the identification of a novel oxazolidinone resistance gene, optra, and a first investigation of the extent to which this gene was present in e. faecalis and enterococcus faecium from humans and food-producing animals. methods: the resistance gene optra was identified by whole-plasmid sequencing and subsequent cloning and expression in a susceptible enterococcus host. transformation and conjugation assays served to investigate the transferability of optra. all optra-positive e. faecalis and e. faecium isolates of human and animal origin were analysed for their mics and their genotype, as well as the location of optra. results: the novel plasmid-borne abc transporter gene optra from e. faecalis e349 conferred combined resistance or elevated mics (when no clinical breakpoints were available) to oxazolidinones (linezolid and tedizolid) and phenicols (chloramphenicol and florfenicol). the corresponding conjugative plasmid pe349, on which optra was located, had a size of 36 331 bp and also carried the phenicol exporter gene fexa. the optra gene was functionally expressed in e. faecalis, e. faecium and staphylococcus aureus. it was detected more frequently in e. faecalis and e. faecium from food-producing animals (20.3%  and 5.7%, respectively) than from humans (4.2% and 0.6%, respectively). conclusions: enterococci with elevated mics of linezolid and tedizolid should be  tested not only for 23s rrna mutations and the gene cfr, but also for the novel resistance gene optra.

TI  == is256 abolishes gelatinase activity and biofilm formation in a mutant of the nosocomial pathogen enterococcus faecalis v583.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis is one of the most controversial species of lactic acid bacteria. some strains are used as probiotics, while others are associated with severe and life-threatening nosocomial infections. their pathogenicity depends on the acquisition of multidrug resistance and virulence factors. gelatinase, which  is required in the first steps of biofilm formation, is an important virulence determinant involved in e. faecalis pathogenesis, including endocarditis and peritonitis. the gene that codes for gelatinase (gele) is controlled by the fsr quorum-sensing system, whose encoding genes (fsra, fsrb, fsrc, and fsrd) are located immediately upstream of gele. the integration of a dna fragment into the  fsr locus of a derived mutant of e. faecalis v583 suppressed the gelatinase activity and prevented biofilm formation. sequence analysis indicated the presence of is256 integrated into the fsrc gene at nucleotide position 321. interestingly, is256 is also associated with biofilm formation in staphylococcus  epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus. this is the first description of an insertion sequence that prevents biofilm formation in e. faecalis.

TI  == polyamine derivatives of betulinic acid and beta-sitosterol: a comparative investigation.
AB  == beta-sitosterol and betulinic acid were used in designing their conjugates with selected polyamines bearing either an amide bond, or an ester and an amide bond simultaneously in the target molecule. the synthesized compounds were subjected to basic cytotoxic and antimicrobial tests. the synthetic protocol is described separately for each of the three series of the target amides, because each series of compounds required a different synthetic approach. the cytotoxicity was tested on cells derived from human t-lymphoblastic leukemia, breast adenocarcinoma and cervical cancer, and compared with the tests on normal human fibroblasts. most of the target compounds (5a-5c, 11a-11c and 16a-16c) showed medium to high cytotoxicity (0.7-7.8mum), however, in some cases the compounds showed high cytotoxicity even toward normal human fibroblasts (11a-11c). two compounds of this series (11c and 16c) also displayed antimicrobial activity with high and selective microbe specificity. the compound 11c was potent against escherichia coli (minimal inhibition concentration (mic) 6.25mugml(-1), i.e. 9.75nmml(-1)) and staphylococcus aureus (mic 12.5mugml(-1), i.e. 19.5nmml(-1)), and showed medium activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the compound 16c was highly active against enterococcus faecalis and s. aureus (both, mic 3.125mugml(-1), i.e. 4.22nmml(-1)), both gram-positive bacteria, however showed only weak activity against e. coli and no activity against p. aeruginosa, both gram-negative bacteria, which indicates possible microbe specificity of 16c. comparing beta-sitosterol-based series (5a-5c) and betulinic acid series (11a-11c and 16a-16c) of the target compounds, the latter one gave more promising structures. the compounds 11c and 16c showed effects which may be described as multifarious activity (pleiotropic effects).

TI  == preparation, characterization and antibacterial properties of zno/kaoline nanocomposites.
AB  == this paper describes laboratory preparation, characterization and antibacterial activity testing of zno/kaoline composites. zno/kaoline composites with 50wt.% of zno were laboratory prepared, dried at 105 degrees c and calcined at 500 degrees  c. xrpd analysis revealed that thermal treatment caused the phase transformation  of zn containing precursor into zno. scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were used for characterization of morphology of the prepared samples. a standard microdilution test was used for evaluation of antibacterial activity using four common human pathogens (staphylococcus aureus,  escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). daylight was used for induction photocatalytically based antibacterial activity. second possible explanation of antibacterial activity of zno/kaoline could be the presence of biologically available forms of zinc. during the antibacterial activity assays the zno/kaoline composites exhibited antibacterial activity, where differences in an onset of the antibacterial activity and activity against  bacterial strains were observed. the highest antibacterial activity was observed  against s. aureus, where the lowest value of minimum inhibitory concentration was determined equal to 0.41mg/ml.

TI  == evaluation of regional antibiograms to monitor antimicrobial resistance in hampton roads, virginia.
AB  == we studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the hampton roads area, virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated  with eastern virginia medical school. the data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. staphylococcus aureus was the most common gram- positive and e. coli the  most common gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. overall 53% of s.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. there was a broad scatter of mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and mic of 4 mug/ml was reported in 2012. penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of streptococcus pneumoniae. vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of enterococcus faecium and 2%  of enterococcus faecalis respectively. acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant gram negative organism in the data compiled. among the escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( sxt) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. we found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.

TI  == review and phylogenetic analysis of qac genes that reduce susceptibility to quaternary ammonium compounds in staphylococcus species.
AB  == the qac genes of staphylococcus species encode multidrug efflux pumps: membrane proteins that export toxic molecules and thus increase tolerance to a variety of  compounds such as disinfecting agents, including quaternary ammonium compounds (for which they are named), intercalating dyes and some antibiotics. in stapylococcus species, six different plasmid-encoded qac efflux pumps have been described, and they belong to two major protein families. qaca and qacb are members of the major facilitator superfamily, while qacc, qacg, qach, and qacj all belong to the small multidrug resistance (smr) family. not all smr proteins are called qac and the reverse is also true, which has caused confusion in the literature and in gene annotations. the discovery of qac genes and their presence in various staphylococcal populations is briefly reviewed. a sequence comparison  revealed that some of the pcr primers described in the literature for qac detection may miss particular qac genes due to lack of dna conservation. despite  their resemblance in substrate specificity, the qac proteins belonging to the two protein families have little in common. qaca and qacb are highly conserved in staphylococcus species, while qaca was also detected in enterococcus faecalis, suggesting that these plasmid-born genes have spread across bacterial genera. nevertheless, these qaca and qacb genes are quite dissimilar to their closest homologues in other organisms. in contrast, smr-type qac proteins display considerable sequence variation, despite their short length, even within the staphylococcus genus. phylogenetic analysis of these genes identified similarity  to a large number of other smr members, found in staphylococci as well as in other genera. a number of phylogenetic trees of smr qac proteins are presented here, starting with genes present in s. aureus and s. epidermidis, and extending  this to related genes found in other species of this genus, and finally to genes  found in other genera.

TI  == antimicrobial evaluation of plants used for the treatment of diarrhoea in a rural community in northern maputaland, kwazulu-natal, south africa.
AB  == background: zulu people living in the rural area of maputaland (kwazulu-natal, south africa) rely heavily on medicinal plants for the treatment of diarrhoea. abundant availability of medicinal plants in the study area offers low cost health care, but scientific validation is needed in order to lend credibility to  the traditional use against many ailments including diarrhoeal infections. with this in mind a study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of  23 plant species which are used for the treatment of diarrhoea in rural maputaland. four 1:1 plant combinations were also evaluated to determine their interactive effects against seven diarrhoea-related bacterial pathogens. methods: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assays were undertaken on dichloromethane-methanol (ch2cl2: meoh) and aqueous crude extracts. the following micro-organisms were selected for this study and were tested based on their association with stomach ailments and diarrhoea; bacillus cereus (atcc 11778), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), escherichia coli (atcc 8739), proteus vulgaris (atcc 33420), salmonella typhimurium (atcc 14028), shigella flexneri (atcc 25875) and staphylococcus aureus (atcc 12600). the fractional inhibitory concentration index (sigmafic) was determined for plants traditionally used in combination. results: shigella flexneri proved to be the most susceptible pathogen, where the organic extract of terminalia sericea showed the most prominent noteworthy antibacterial activity (mean mic value of 0.04 mg/ml). the aqueous extracts generally showed poorer antimicrobial activity with some exceptions i.e. acacia burkei, brachylaena transvaalensis against b. cereus and b. transvaalensis against s. flexneri. in the combination studies, synergy was predominant with mean (across all pathogens) sigmafic values of 0.30 for acanthospermum glabratum with krauseola mosambicina; sigmafic values of 0.46 for  a. glabratum with psidium guajava; sigmafic values of 0.39 for b. transvaalensis  with p. guajava and sigmafic values of 0.88 (additive) for the combination of b.  transvaalensis with sclerocarya birrea. conclusion: this study provided some insight into the bacterial in vitro efficacies of plants traditionally used to treat diarrhoea by the people of northern maputaland. very little connection was  observed between frequency of use and efficacy. plant combinations demonstrated favourable efficacy with mostly synergistic effects noted, lending some credibility to their use in combination.

TI  == incidence, risk factors, microbiology of venous catheter associated bloodstream infections--a prospective study from a tertiary care hospital.
AB  == purpose: central venous catheters (cvcs) though indispensable in current medical  and intensive care treatment, also puts patients at risk of catheter related infection (cri) resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. we analysed the incidence, risk factors, bacteriological profile and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the isolates in central venous catheter associated bloodstream infection (cvc-bsi) in the intensive care unit (icu) patients and studied the formation of biofilm in cvcs. materials and methods: the following case control study included 115 patients with cvc in situ. quantitative blood cultures (qbc) and catheter tip cultures were performed for the diagnoses. direct catheter staining was done for an early diagnosis by acridine orange (ao) and gram staining methods. biofilm production in catheters was detected by 'tissue culture plate' (tcp) method. the results were analysed using the computer-based program statistical package for the social sciences (spss). results: in 25/115 patients,  definite diagnosis of cvc-bsi was made. the mean age was 48.44 +/- 17.34 years (cases) vs 40.10 +/- 18.24 years (controls) and the mean duration of catheterisation was 25.72 +/- 8.73 days (cases) vs 11.89 +/- 6.38 days (controls). local signs of infection (erythema, tenderness and oozing) were found more significantly in cvc-bsi cases. the ao staining was more sensitive and gram  staining of catheters showed higher specificity. staphylococcus aureus followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa and non-albicans candida were common cvc-bsi pathogens. multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains were isolated in bacterial agents of cvc-bsi. non-albicans candida and enterococcus faecalis showed strong biofilm production.  conclusion: the incidence of cvc-bsi was 21.73% and the rate was 14.59 per 1000 catheter days. prolonged icu stay and longer catheterisation were major risk factors. s. aureus was isolated most commonly in cvc-bsi cases. the menace of multidrug resistance and biofilm formation in cvcs is associated with cvc-bsi.

TI  == auranofin exerts broad-spectrum bactericidal activities by targeting thiol-redox  homeostasis.
AB  == infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a rising public health threat and make the identification of new antibiotics a priority. from a cell-based screen for bactericidal compounds against mycobacterium tuberculosis under nutrient-deprivation conditions we identified auranofin, an orally bioavailable fda-approved antirheumatic drug, as having potent bactericidal activities against both replicating and nonreplicating m. tuberculosis. we also found that auranofin is active against other gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis and enterococcus faecalis, and drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. our biochemical studies showed that auranofin inhibits the bacterial thioredoxin reductase, a protein essential in many gram-positive bacteria for maintaining the thiol-redox balance and protecting against reactive oxidative species. auranofin  decreases the reducing capacity of target bacteria, thereby sensitizing them to oxidative stress. finally, auranofin was efficacious in a murine model of methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection. these results suggest that the thioredoxin-mediated redox cascade of gram-positive pathogens is a valid target for the development of antibacterial drugs, and that the existing clinical agent  auranofin may be repurposed to aid in the treatment of several important antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

TI  == bactericidal activity of curcumin i is associated with damaging of bacterial membrane.
AB  == curcumin, an important constituent of turmeric, is known for various biological activities, primarily due to its antioxidant mechanism. the present study focused on the antibacterial activity of curcumin i, a significant component of commercial curcumin, against four genera of bacteria, including those that are gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa). these represent prominent human pathogens, particularly in hospital settings. our study shows the strong antibacterial potential of curcumin i against all the tested bacteria from gram-positive as well as gram-negative groups. the integrity of the bacterial membrane was checked using two differential permeabilization indicating fluorescent probes, namely, propidium iodide and calcein. both the membrane permeabilization assays confirmed membrane leakage in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria on exposure to curcumin i. in addition, scanning electron  microscopy and fluorescence microscopy were employed to confirm the membrane damages in bacterial cells on exposure to curcumin i. the present study confirms  the broad-spectrum antibacterial nature of curcumin i, and its membrane damaging  property. findings from this study could provide impetus for further research on  curcumin i regarding its antibiotic potential against rapidly emerging bacterial  pathogens.

TI  == [analysis of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in neonatal purulent meningitis].
AB  == objective: to study the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotics resistance of neonatal purulent meningitis in order to provide the guide for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. method: a retrospective review was performed and a total of 112 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis (male 64, female 58) were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit of yuying children's hospital of wenzhou medical university seen from january 1, 2004 to december 31, 2013. the clinical information including pathogenic bacterial distribution, drug sensitivity, head imageology and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. numeration data were shown in ratio and chi square test was applied for group comparison. result: among 112 cases, 46 were admitted from 2004 to 2008 and 66 from 2009 to 2013, 23 patients were preterm and 89 were term, 20 were early onset (occurring within 3 days of life) and 92 were late onset meningitis (occurring after 3 days of life). in 62 (55.4%) cases the pathogens were gram-positive bacteria and in 50 (44.6%) were gram-negative bacteria. the five most frequently isolated pathogens were escherichia coli (32 cases, 28.6%),  coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns, 20 cases, 17.9%), streptococcus (18 cases, 16.1%, streptococcus agalactiae 15 cases), enterococci (13 cases, 11.6%),  staphylococcus aureus (9 cases, 8.0%). comparison of pathogenic bacterial distribution between 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 showed that gram-positive bacteria accounted for more than 50% in both period. escherichia coli was the most common  bacterium, followed by streptococcus in last five years which was higher than the first five years (22.7% (15/66) vs. 6.5% (3/46), chi(2) = 5.278, p < 0.05). klebsiella pneumoniae was more common isolate in preterm infants than in term infants (13.0% (3/23) vs. 1.1% (1/89), chi(2) = 7.540, p < 0.05). streptococcus (most were streptococcus agalactiae) was the most common bacteria in early onset  meningitis and higher than those in late onset meningitis (35.0% (7/20) vs. 12.0% (11/92), chi(2) = 4.872, p < 0.05). drug sensitivity tests showed that all the gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive to linezolid. staphylococci were  resistant to penicillin, and most of them were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin and cefazolin; 77.8%of cns isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. no streptococcus and enterococcus faecalis was resistant to penicillin. none of enterococci was resistant to vancomycin. among the gram-negative bacterial isolates, more than 40% of escherichia coli were resistant to commonly used cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and all of them were sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone sulbactam and imipenem. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae were all resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none of them was resistant to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. of the 112 patients, 69 were cured, 23 improved, 9 uncured and 11 died. there were 47 cases (42.0%) with poor prognosis, they had abnormal head imageology, severe complications and some cases died, 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients with meningitis caused by streptococcus died. conclusion:  escherichia coli, cns and streptococcus are the predominant pathogens responsible for neonatal purulent meningitis over the past ten years. there were increasing numbers of cases with streptococcus meningitis which are more common in early onset meningitis with adverse outcome, therefore careful attention should be paid in clinic. linezolid should be used as a new choice in intractable neonatal purulent meningitis cases caused by gram positive bacteria.

TI  == new antimicrobial contact catalyst killing antibiotic resistant clinical and waterborne pathogens.
AB  == microbial growth on medical and technical devices is a big health issue, particularly when microorganisms aggregate to form biofilms. moreover, the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the clinical environment is dramatically growing, making treatment of bacterial infections very challenging.  in search of an alternative, we studied a novel antimicrobial surface coating based on micro galvanic elements formed by silver and ruthenium with surface catalytic properties. the antimicrobial coating efficiently inhibited the growth  of the nosocomial pathogens staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as demonstrated by the growth inhibition on agar surface and in biofilms of antibiotic resistant clinical e. faecalis, e. faecium, and s. aureus isolates. it also strongly reduced the growth of legionella in a drinking water pipeline and of escherichia coli in urine. we postulate a mode of action of the antimicrobial material, which is independent of the release of silver ions. thus, the novel antimicrobial coating could represent an alternative to combat microbial growth avoiding the toxic side effects of high levels of silver ions on eukaryotic cells.

TI  == in vitro activity of gentamicin, vancomycin or amikacin combined with edta or l-arginine as lock therapy against a wide spectrum of biofilm-forming clinical strains isolated from catheter-related infections.
AB  == objectives: treatment of catheter-related bloodstream infections (crbsi) is hampered by the characteristic tolerance of bacterial biofilms towards antibiotics. our objective was to study the effect of the combination of antibiotics and the alkaline amino acid l-arginine or the cation chelator edta on the bacterial killing of in vitro biofilms formed by an array of clinical strains responsible for crbsi and representative of epidemiologically relevant bacterial  species. methods: among 32 strains described in a previous clinical study, we focused on the most antibiotic-tolerant strains including cons (n = 4), staphylococcus aureus (n = 4), enterococcus faecalis (n = 2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and enterobacteriaceae (n = 4). we used an in vitro biofilm model (96-well plate assay) to study biofilm tolerance and tested various combinations of antibiotics and non-antibiotic adjuvants. gentamicin, amikacin or vancomycin was combined with disodium edta or l-arginine for 24 h to reproduce the antibiotic lock therapy (alt) approach. killing of biofilm bacteria was measured by cfu quantification after a vigorous step of pipetting up and down in  order to detach all biofilm bacteria from the surface of the wells. results: both of our adjuvant strategies significantly increased the effect of antibiotics against biofilms formed by gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens. the combination of gentamicin + edta was active against all tested strains apart  from one p. aeruginosa. the combination of gentamicin + l-arginine was active against most of the tested strains with the notable exception of cons for which no potentiation was observed. we also demonstrated that amikacin + edta was active against gram-negative bacteria and that vancomycin + edta was active against gram-positive bacteria. conclusions: the addition of edta enhanced the activity of gentamicin, amikacin and vancomycin against biofilms formed by a wide spectrum of bacterial strains responsible for crbsi.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of anacardium occidentale and mangifera indica in oral care.
AB  == background: oral health is an integral and important component of general health. infectious diseases such as caries, periodontal, and gingivitis indicate the onset of imbalance in homeostasis between oral micro biota and host. the present  day medicaments used in oral health care have numerous side effects. the uses of  herbal plants as an alternative have gained popularity due to side effects of antibiotics and emergence of multidrug resistant strains. anacardium occidentale  (cashew) and mangifera indica (mango) have been used as traditional oral health care measures in india since time immemorial. materials and methods: the ethanol  extracts of cashew and mango leaves were obtained by maceration method. the antimicrobial activity was evaluated by clear zone produced by these plant extracts against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, and candida albicans in agar plate method, determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration (mbc/mfc), and suppression of biofilm. the  cytotoxic effects of plants extract was determined by microculture tetrazolium assay on human gingival fibroblast and chinese hamster lung fibroblast (v79) cell lines. results: cashew and mango leaf extract significantly (p < 0.05) produced larger zone of inhibition against test pathogens when compared to povidone-iodine-based mouth rinses. although the mic and mbc/mfc values of mouth  rinses were effective in lower concentrations; plant extracts significantly (p <  0.001) suppressed the biofilms of oral pathogens. the leaf extracts were less cytotoxic (p < 0.001) compared to mouth rinses. conclusions: plant extracts are superior to the mouth rinses and have a promising role in future oral health care.

TI  == nonselective mevalonate kinase inhibitor as a novel class of antibacterial agents.
AB  == introduction. there are a few evidences about targeting isoprenoids biosynthesis  pathway in bacteria for finding new antibiotics. this study was conducted to assess antibacterial effects of vanadyl sulfate (vs), one of the mevalonate kinase inhibitors to find a new target for killing bacteria. materials and methods. antibacterial effect of vs alone and in combination with glycine or edta was assessed on escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa as gram-negative and  staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis as gram-positive bacteria using serial dilution method and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) identified. result. mics for s. aureus and e. coli were 4 and 8 mg/ml, respectively. vs could not affect the growth of two other bacteria. however, vs in combination with glycine not only inhibited the growth of e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa, but also  reduced mics for vs-sensitive bacteria (s. aureus and e. coli). edta could reduce mic for e. coli and p. aeruginosa. conclusion. vs could inhibit the growth of s.  aurous and e. coli, and adding glycine or edta improved vs antibacterial activity presumably via instability of the cell wall and enhanced transport of vs through  bacterial cell wall. inhibition of the isoprenoid pathway might provide new tools to overcome bacterial resistance.

TI  == bactericidal activity and mechanism of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  == the bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans) and gram-negative bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/ml polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to led light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mw/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity  followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. it was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial dna, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. the present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.

TI  == utilization of blood cultures in danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  == this national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (bcs). a primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. from the danish microbiology database, we retrieved all bcs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the national patient registry. in total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one bc was taken. almost 50% of bcs were taken at admission. the chance of having a bc taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one bc  was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. ten species, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. an increase in bcs and positive bcs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. bcs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for s. pneumoniae particularly. a predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to s. aureus, e. faecium and k. pneumoniae. minor differences in bcs and positive bcs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. the study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.

TI  == natural sesquiterpene lactones enhance oxacillin and gentamicin effectiveness against pathogenic bacteria without antibacterial effects on beneficial lactobacilli.
AB  == this is a report on the synergistic interactions (sis) between melampolide-type sesquiterpene lactones 1-8 from acanthospermum hispidum dc., and oxacillin or gentamicin, against four pathogenic strains of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis; two of them were multi-resistant strains obtained from chronic infectious processes. our results showed that all associations of 1-8 with antibiotics (atbs) are more effective than pure atbs to control pathogenic strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis. the most relevant sis were observed when the major lactone of a. hispidum, acanthospermal b [5], was combined with gentamicin (protein synthesis inhibitor) against an ex vivo culture of methicillin-resistant s. aureus sar 1, displaying a significant mic reduction in  5 (312.5 to 78.1 microg/ml), and gentamicin (120 microg/ml to 3 microg/ml). compound 4 improved the antibiotic potency of oxacillin (cell wall synthesis inhibitor) against ampicillin-resistant e. faecalis (60 microg/ml to 1.5 microg/ml). it is important to remark that three beneficial lactobacilli were resistant to 1-8 and their mixtures with gentamicin or oxacillin in effective concentrations against pathogenic bacteria. synergism between atbs and phytochemicals is a therapeutically helpful concept to improve atb efficacy and prevent resistance. the present results show that selective sis occur between melampolides and gentamicin or oxacillin, and open a new field of research. copyright (c) 2015 john wiley & sons, ltd.

TI  == optimizing supercritical carbon dioxide in the inactivation of bacteria in clinical solid waste by using response surface methodology.
AB  == clinical solid waste (csw) poses a challenge to health care facilities because of the presence of pathogenic microorganisms, leading to concerns in the effective sterilization of the csw for safe handling and elimination of infectious disease  transmission. in the present study, supercritical carbon dioxide (sc-co2) was applied to inactivate gram-positive staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and gram-negative escherichia coli in csw. the effects of sc-co2 sterilization parameters such as pressure, temperature, and time were investigated and optimized by response surface methodology (rsm). results showed  that the data were adequately fitted into the second-order polynomial model. the  linear quadratic terms and interaction between pressure and temperature had significant effects on the inactivation of s. aureus, e. coli, e. faecalis, and b. subtilis in csw. optimum conditions for the complete inactivation of bacteria  within the experimental range of the studied variables were 20 mpa, 60 degrees c, and 60 min. the sc-co2-treated bacterial cells, observed under a scanning electron microscope, showed morphological changes, including cell breakage and dislodged cell walls, which could have caused the inactivation. this espouses the inference that sc-co2 exerts strong inactivating effects on the bacteria present  in csw, and has the potential to be used in csw management for the safe handling  and recycling-reuse of csw materials.

TI  == microbiological characterization of aquatic microbiomes targeting taxonomical marker genes and antibiotic resistance genes of opportunistic bacteria.
AB  == the dissemination of medically relevant antibiotic resistance genes (args) (blavim-1, vana, ampc, ermb, and meca) and opportunistic bacteria (enterococcus faecium/faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, and cns) was determined in different anthropogenically influenced aquatic habitats in a selected region of germany. over a period of two years, four differently sized wastewater treatment plants (wwtps) with and without clinical influence, three surface waters, four rain overflow basins, and three groundwater sites were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). results were calculated in cell equivalents per 100 ng of total dna extracted from water  samples and per 100 ml sample volume, which seems to underestimate the abundance  of antibiotic resistance and opportunistic bacteria. high abundances of opportunistic bacteria and arg were quantified in clinical wastewaters and influents of the adjacent wwtp. the removal capacities of wwtp were up to 99% for some, but not all investigated bacteria. the abundances of most arg targets were  found to be increased in the bacterial population after conventional wastewater treatment. as a consequence, downstream surface water and also some groundwater compartments displayed high abundances of all four args. it became obvious that the dynamics of the arg differed from the fate of the opportunistic bacteria. this underlines the necessity of an advanced microbial characterization of anthropogenically influenced environments.

TI  == nanobioarchitectures based on chlorophyll photopigment, artificial lipid bilayers and carbon nanotubes.
AB  == in the last decade, building biohybrid materials has gained considerable interest in the field of nanotechnology. this paper describes an original design for bionanoarchitectures with interesting properties and potential bioapplications. multilamellar lipid vesicles (obtained by hydration of a dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine thin film) with and without cholesterol were labelled with a  natural photopigment (chlorophyll a), which functioned as a sensor to detect modifications in the artificial lipid bilayers. these biomimetic membranes were used to build non-covalent structures with single-walled carbon nanotubes. different biophysical methods were employed to characterize these biohybrids such as: uv-vis absorption and emission spectroscopy, zeta potential measurements, afm and chemiluminescence techniques. the designed, carbon-based biohybrids exhibited good physical stability, good antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, and could be used as biocoating materials. as compared to the cholesterol-free samples, the cholesterol-containing hybrid structures demonstrated better stability (i.e., their zeta potential reached the value of -36.4 mv), more pronounced oxygen radical scavenging ability (affording an antioxidant activity of 73.25%) and enhanced biocidal ability, offering inhibition zones of 12.4, 11.3 and 10.2 mm in diameter, against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, respectively.

TI  == detection of listeria monocytogenes with short peptide fragments from class iia bacteriocins as recognition elements.
AB  == we employed a direct peptide-bacteria binding assay to screen peptide fragments for high and specific binding to listeria monocytogenes. peptides were screened from a peptide array library synthesized on cellulose membrane. twenty four peptide fragments (each a 14-mer) were derived from three potent anti-listerial peptides, leucocin a, pediocin pa1, and curvacin a, that belong to class iia bacteriocins. fragment leu10 (geafsagvhrlang), derived from the c-terminal region of leucocin a, displayed the highest binding among all of the library fragments toward several pathogenic gram-positive bacteria, including l. monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. the specific binding of leu10 to l. monocytogenes was further validated using microcantilever (mcl) experiments. microcantilevers coated with gold were functionalized with peptides  by chemical conjugation using a cysteamine linker to yield a peptide density of approximately 4.8x10(-3) mumol/cm2 for different peptide fragments. leu10 (14-mer) functionalized mcl was able to detect listeria with same sensitivity as  that of leucocin a (37-mer) functionalized mcl, validating the use of short peptide fragments in bacterial detection platforms. fragment leu10 folded into a  helical conformation in solution, like that of native leucocin a, suggesting that both leu10 and leucocin a may employ a similar mechanism for binding target bacteria. the results show that peptide-conjugated microcantilevers can function  as highly sensitive platforms for listeria detection and hold potential to be developed as biosensors for pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == removal of total and antibiotic resistant bacteria in advanced wastewater treatment by ozonation in combination with different filtering techniques.
AB  == elimination of bacteria by ozonation in combination with charcoal or slow sand filtration for advanced sewage treatment to improve the quality of treated sewage and to reduce the potential risk for human health of receiving surface waters was investigated in pilot scale at the sewage treatment plant eriskirch, baden-wuerttemberg/germany. to determine the elimination of sewage bacteria, inflowing and leaving wastewater of different treatment processes was analysed in a culture-based approach for its content of escherichia coli, enterococci and staphylococci and their resistance against selected antibiotics over a period of  17 month. for enterococci, single species and their antibiotic resistances were identified. in comparison to the established flocculation filtration at eriskirch, ozonation plus charcoal or sand filtration (pilot-scale) reduced the concentrations of total and antibiotic resistant e. coli, enterococci and staphylococci. however, antibiotic resistant e. coli and staphylococci apparently survived ozone treatment better than antibiotic sensitive strains. neither vancomycin resistant enterococci nor methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa) were detected. the decreased percentage of antibiotic resistant enterococci after ozonation may be explained by a different ozone sensitivity of  species: enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, which determined the resistance-level, seemed to be more sensitive for ozone than other enterococcus-species. overall, ozonation followed by charcoal or sand filtration  led to 0.8-1.1 log-units less total and antibiotic resistant e. coli, enterococci and staphylococci, as compared to the respective concentrations in treated sewage by only flocculation filtration. thus, advanced wastewater treatment by ozonation plus charcoal or sand filtration after common sewage treatment is an effective tool for further elimination of microorganisms from sewage before discharge in surface waters.

TI  == integration of non-oral bacteria into in vitro oral biofilms.
AB  == biofilms are polymicrobial communities that grow on surfaces in nature. oral bacteria can spontaneously form biofilms on the surface of teeth, which may compromise the health of the teeth, or their surrounding (periodontal) tissues. while the oral bacteria exhibit high tropism for their specialized ecological niche, it is not clear if bacteria that are not part of the normal oral microbiota can efficiently colonize and grow within oral biofilms. by using an in vitro "supragingival" biofilm model of 6 oral species, this study aimed to investigate if 3 individual bacterial species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota (eschericia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecails) and one not previously tested oral species (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) can be incorporated into this established supragingival biofilm model. staphylococcus aureus and a. actinomycetemcomitans were able to grow efficiently in the biofilm, without disrupting the growth of the remaining species. they localized in sparse small aggregates within the biofilm mass. enterococcus faecalis and e. coli were both able to populate the biofilm at high  numbers, and suppressed the growth of a. oris and s. mutants. enterococcus faecalis was arranged in a chain-like conformation, whereas e. coli was densely and evenly spread throughout the biofilm mass. in conclusion, it is possible for  selected species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota to be introduced into an oral biofilm, under the given experimental micro-environmental conditions. moreover, the equilibrated incorporation of a. actinomycetemcomitans  and s. aureus in this oral biofilm model could be a useful tool in the study of aggressive periodontitis and peri-implantitis, in which these organisms are involved, respectively.

TI  == stable synthetic mono-substituted cationic bacteriochlorins mediate selective broad-spectrum photoinactivation of drug-resistant pathogens at nanomolar concentrations.
AB  == three stable synthetic mono-substituted cationic bacteriochlorins (bc37, bc38 and bc39) were recently reported to show exceptional activity (low nanomolar) in mediating photodynamic killing of human cancer cells after a 24h incubation upon  excitation with near-infrared light (730 nm). the presence of cationic quaternary ammonium groups in each compound suggested likely activity as antimicrobial photosensitizers. herein this hypothesis was tested against a panel of pathogenic microorganisms that have all recently drawn attention due to increased drug-resistance (gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis; gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii; and fungal yeasts, candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans). all three bacteriochlorins were highly effective against both gram-positive species (>6 logs of eradication at 200 nm and 10 j/cm(2)). the dicationic bacteriochlorin (bc38) was best against the gram-negative species (>6 logs at 1-2 mum) whereas the lipophilic monocationic bacteriochlorin (bc39) was best against the fungi (>6 logs at 1 mum). the bacteriochlorins produced substantial singlet oxygen (and apparently less type-1 reactive-oxygen species such as hydroxyl radical) as judged by activation of fluorescent probes and comparison with 1h-phenalen-1-one-2-sulfonic acid; the order of activity was bc37 > bc38 > bc39.  a short incubation time (30 min) resulted in selectivity for microbial cells over hela human cells. the highly active photodynamic inactivation of microbial cells  may stem from the amphiphilic and cationic features of the bacteriochlorins.

TI  == antibacterial compounds from salvia adenophora fernald (lamiaceae).
AB  == from the aerial parts of salvia adenophora fernald four derivatives of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (1-4) together with five clerodane diterpenoids (5, 6, 8-10), and one known diterpene (7) have been isolated. compounds 1-6 and 8-10 are described for the first time. the structures were established by extensive 1d, 2d nmr and hresi-tofms spectroscopic methods. finally, the absolute configuration has been established by comparing of experimental and quantum chemical calculation of ecd spectra. despite a total lack of antimicrobial activity of the plant extract, hinting to the existence of antagonistic interactions in the crude material, three oxylipins (2-4) displayed a promising inhibition on gram-positive multidrug-resistant clinical strains including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae and, particularly, staphylococcus epidermidis, while the compounds 9 and 10 revealed a specific and strain-dependent activity against s. epidermidis. interestingly, the inhibition provided by these compounds was independent of the resistance patterns of these pathogens to classic antibiotics. no action was reported on gram-negative strains nor on candida albicans. these results confirm that clerodanes and, particularly, prostaglandin-like compounds can be considered as interesting antimicrobial agents deserving further study.

AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: linum usitatissimum, commonly known as flaxseed has traditionally been used for the management of diarrhea and gastrointestinal infections. this study was planned to assess pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of flaxseed in infectious and non-infectious diarrhea. materials and methods: the crude aqueous-methanolic extract of flaxseed was studied using the in vivo castor oil-induced diarrhea, gut motility and enteropooling assays. mechanistic basis was further elucidated by testing the inhibitory effect on spontaneously contracting isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, suspended in a 10ml tissue bath containing tyrode solution, maintained at 37 degrees c and aerated with carbogen. antibacterial efficacy of the flaxseed extract was tested  against different enteric and non-enteric pathogenic bacteria using in vitro antibacterial assays. results: flaxseed extract reduced the diarrheal score in mice, by 39%, 63.90% and 68.34% at the respective doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. intestinal secretions were reduced by 24.12%, 28.09% and 38.80%, whereas the intestinal motility was reduced by 31.66%, 46.98% and 56.20% at respective doses  of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. when tested on isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, flaxseed extract produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both spontaneous and high k(+) (80mm)-induced contractions, and shifted the concentration-response curves of ca(++) to the right with suppression of the maximum response, similar to that caused by verapamil. flaxseed extract was found to possess bactericidal activity at the tested concentrations of 12.5mg/ml, against vancomycin-resistant  enterococcus faecalis (100%), escherichia coli k1 (88.88%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (98.76%), bacillus cereus (92.64%), pseudomonas aeruginosa  (76.83%) and salmonella typhi (26.91+/-3.35%). the concentration of 10mg/ml showed bactericidal effects against all the aforementioned pathogens except escherichia coli k1, whereas for pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi, it  was bacteriostatic at this concentration. conclusions: our results indicate that  linum usitatissimum (flaxseed) extract exhibits antidiarrheal and antispasmodic activities by virtue of its antimotility and antisecretory effects which are mediated possibly through inhibition of ca(++) channels, though additional mechanism(s) cannot be ruled out. flaxseed extract proved effective against both  enteric and non-enteric pathogens causing diarrhea, thus ensuring wide coverage and rationalizing its medicinal use in both the infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.

TI  == antimicrobial bioassay-guided fractionation of a methanol extract of eupatorium triplinerve.
AB  == context: eupatorium triplinerve vahl (asteraceae), popularly known as japana, is  widely used in folk medicine, due its analgesic, anticoagulant, antianorexic, antiparasitic, anthelmintic, sedative, antifungal, and antibacterial properties.  objective: the present study evaluated the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of e. triplinerve extracts from different parts of the plant and identified the extract with the highest antimicrobial potential. materials and methods: extracts were obtained by maceration of all parts of plant, and subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation of methanol extract by partition column chromatography. the major chemical groups, saponins, reducing sugars, alkaloids, steroids, triterpenoids, phenols, tannins, flavonoids, and others were screened by standard techniques. the antimicrobial activity of the different extracts was performed by microdilution assay and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) values were reported. results: phytochemical screening of hydroalcoholic extract from all parts of e. triplinerve identified mainly steroids, coumarins, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, depsides and absence of polysaccharides and flavonoids. the methanol extract of leaves presented the highest content of coumarins and lower mic values of 62 and 75 microg/ml against enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, respectively. in addition, its non-polar fractions showed  antimicrobial activity with mic ranging from 16 to 125 microg/ml against gram-negative bacteria, mainly escherichia coli. discussion and conclusion: data  showed that non-polar fractions of e. triplinerve methanolic extract has better antimicrobial activity and most likely depends on the presence of several compounds, such as depsidones, coumarins, saponins, and triterpenes on crude extract. the results can be exploited largely in research of new antibacterial agents.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activity of hyperimmune globulin preparations against multiresistant nosocomial pathogens.
AB  == purpose: we compared different immunoglobulin preparations containing igg (intraglobin/intratect) or a mixture of igg, iga, and igm (pentaglobin) to assess the opsonic and protective efficacy of human immunoglobulin preparations against  multiresistent nosocomial pathogens. materials and methods: clinical isolates of  e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus aureus were tested by opsonophagocytic assay using immunologobulin preparations at dilutions usually obtained in patients. the target antigens of opsonic antibodies were characterized by opsonophagocytic inhibition assays, and the protective efficacy in vivo was tested in a mouse bacteremia model as previously described. results: all strains  were killed to at least 50% by pentaglobin. one p. aeruginosa strain was not efficiently killed by intraglobin (23%) but the other strains were killed by intraglobin to a similar degree compared to pentaglobin. opsonic igg antibodies against e. faecalis were directed against lta, while opsonic antibodies in pentaglobin were primarily directed against other cell wall carbohydrates. in a mouse bacteremia model, pentaglobin was more protective than intratect against staphylococcus aureus, while intratect reduced colony counts better than normal rabbit serum or saline. conclusions: all tested human immunoglobulin preparations contain opsonic and protective antibodies against targets present on multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. enrichment of these preparations with igm increases the protective efficacy against some strains, probably due to antibodies directed against cell wall carbohydrates.

TI  == comparative structural and functional analysis of staphylococcus aureus glucokinase with other bacterial glucokinases.
AB  == glucokinase is classified in bacteria based upon having atp binding site and 'repressor/open reading frames of unknown function/sugar kinases' motif, the sequence of glucokinase gene (jn645812) of staphylococcus aureus atcc12600 showed presence of atp binding site and 'repressor/open reading frames of unknown function/sugar kinases' motif. we have earlier observed glucokinase of s. aureus  has higher affinity towards the substrate compared to other bacterial glucokinase and under anaerobic condition with increased glucose concentration s. aureus exhibited higher rate of biofilm formation. to establish this, 3d structure of glucokinase was built using homology modeling method, the procheck and prosa-web  analysis indicated this built glucokinase structure was close to the crystal structure. this structure was superimposed with different bacterial glucokinase structures and from the root-mean-square deviation values, it is concluded that s. aureus glucokinase exhibited very close homology with enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficle while with other bacteria it showed high degree of variations both in domain and nondomain regions. glucose docking results indicated -12.3697 kcal/mol for s. aureus glucokinase compared with other bacterial glucokinase suggesting higher affinity of glucose which correlates with enzyme kinetics and higher rate of biofilm formation.

TI  == mechanisms of linezolid resistance in staphylococci and enterococci isolated from two teaching hospitals in shanghai, china.
AB  == background: linezolid is one of the most effective treatments against gram-positive pathogens. however, linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains have recently emerged in worldwide. the purpose of this study was to analyse the prevalence and resistance mechanisms of linezolid-resistant/intermediate staphylococci and enterococci in shanghai, china. results: thirty-two linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains, including 14 staphylococcus capitis, three staphylococcus aureus, 14 enterococcus faecalis and one enterococcus faecium clinical isolates, were collected in this study which displayed linezolid mics of 8 to 512 mug/ml, 8-32 mug/ml, 4-8 mug/ml and 4 mug/ml, respectively. all  linezolid-resistant s. capitis isolates had a novel c2131t mutation and a g2603t  mutation in the 23s rrna region, and some had a c316t (arg106cys) substitution in protein l4 and/or harboured cfr. linezolid-resistant s. aureus isolates carried a c389g (ala130gly) substitution in protein l3, and/or harboured cfr. the cfr gene  was flanked by two copies of the is256-like element, with a downstream orf1 gene. linezolid-resistant/intermediate enterococci lacked major resistance mechanisms.  the semi-quantitative biofilm assay showed that 14 linezolid-resistant e. faecalis isolates produced a larger biofilm than linezolid-susceptible e. faecalis strains. transmission electron microscopy showed the cell walls of linezolid-resistant/intermediate strains were thicker than linezolid-susceptible  strains. conclusion: our data indicated that major resistance mechanisms, such as mutations in 23s rrna and ribosomal proteins l3 and l4, along with cfr acquisition, played an important role in linezolid resistance. secondary resistance mechanisms, such as biofilm formation and cell wall thickness, should  also be taken into account.

TI  == bacteriocin protein bacl1 of enterococcus faecalis targets cell division loci and specifically recognizes l-ala2-cross-bridged peptidoglycan.
AB  == bacteriocin 41 (bac41) is produced from clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis and consists of two extracellular proteins, bacl1 and baca. we previously reported that bacl1 protein (595 amino acids, 64.5 kda) is a bacteriolytic peptidoglycan d-isoglutamyl-l-lysine endopeptidase that induces cell lysis of e. faecalis when an accessory factor, baca, is copresent. however,  the target of bacl1 remains unknown. in this study, we investigated the targeting specificity of bacl1. fluorescence microscopy analysis using fluorescent dye-conjugated recombinant protein demonstrated that bacl1 specifically localized at the cell division-associated site, including the equatorial ring, division septum, and nascent cell wall, on the cell surface of target e. faecalis cells. this specific targeting was dependent on the triple repeat of the sh3 domain located in the region from amino acid 329 to 590 of bacl1. repression of cell growth due to the stationary state of the growth phase or to treatment with bacteriostatic antibiotics rescued bacteria from the bacteriolytic activity of bacl1 and baca. the static growth state also abolished the binding and targeting  of bacl1 to the cell division-associated site. furthermore, the targeting of bacl1 was detectable among gram-positive bacteria with an l-ala-l-ala-cross-bridging peptidoglycan, including e. faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, or streptococcus pneumoniae, but not among bacteria with alternate peptidoglycan structures, such as enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus aureus, or listeria monocytogenes. these data suggest that bacl1 specifically targets the l-ala-l-ala-cross-bridged peptidoglycan and potentially  lyses the e. faecalis cells during cell division.

TI  == synthetic teichoic acid conjugate vaccine against nosocomial gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (lta) are amphiphilic polymers that are important constituents of the cell wall of many gram-positive bacteria. the chemical structures of lta vary among organisms, albeit in the majority of gram-positive bacteria the ltas feature a common poly-1,3-(glycerolphosphate) backbone. previously, the specificity of opsonic antibodies for this backbone present in some gram-positive bacteria has been demonstrated, suggesting that this minimal structure may be sufficient for vaccine development. in the present work, we studied a well-defined synthetic lta-fragment, which is able to inhibit opsonic killing of  polyclonal rabbit sera raised against native lta from enterococcus faecalis 12030. this promising compound was conjugated with bsa and used to raise rabbit polyclonal antibodies. subsequently, the opsonic activity of this serum was tested in an opsonophagocytic assay and specificity was confirmed by an opsonophagocytic inhibition assay. the conjugated lta-fragment was able to induce specific opsonic antibodies that mediate killing of the clinical strains e. faecalis 12030, enterococcus faecium e1162, and community-acquired staphylococcus aureus strain mw2 (usa400). prophylactic immunization with the teichoic acid conjugate and with the rabbit serum raised against this compound was evaluated in active and passive immunization studies in mice, and in an enterococcal endocarditis rat model. in all animal models, a statistically significant reduction of colony counts was observed indicating that the novel synthetic lta-fragment conjugate is a promising vaccine candidate for active or passive immunotherapy against e. faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == mapping of the modular closthioamide architecture reveals crucial motifs of polythioamide antibiotics.
AB  == closthioamide, the first known secondary metabolite from an anaerobic microorganism (clostridium cellulolyticum), represents a highly potent antibiotic that is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre) at nanomolar concentrations. to  unveil structure-activity relationships of the unusual polythioamide natural product we have designed a synthetic grid to access analogues with altered terminal aromatic moieties, diverse p-phenyl substituents, different types and sizes of aliphatic spacers, varying numbers of thioamide residues, and diverse sizes and symmetries of the poly-beta-thioalanyl backbone. a library of 28 closthioamide analogues was tested against a panel of human pathogenic bacteria.  we found that aromatic terminal groups, the defined length of the spacer groups,  the presence of all six thioamide residues and the modular arrangement of the beta-thioalanyl units play essential roles for the antibiotic activity of closthioamide, yet there is a degree of freedom in the symmetry of the molecule.  this study yields the first insights into pivotal structural motifs and the structural space of this new family of antibiotics, a prerequisite for the development of these promising antibiotics.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of an experimental dentifrice based on ricinus communis.
AB  == this study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of a ricinus communis-based experimental dentifrice for denture hygiene against the following standard strains: staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans and candida glabrata. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assay was performed with r. communis in pure oil at 2.5%. only e. coli was not inhibited by r. communis, but the mic (0.0781%) was effective against the other microorganisms. from these results it was determined  the r. communis concentrations for experimental dentifrices, 1, 2, 5 and 10%, which were evaluated by the test-well diffusion in agar. the commercial dentifrices colgate, trihydral and corega brite were tested for comparative purposes. the diameter of the zones of bacterial growth inhibition produced around the wells was measured (in mm) with a rule under reflected light. data were analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and tukey's post-hoc test (alpha=0.05). neither the commercial nor the experimental dentifrices were effective against e. coli. the experimental dentifrices containing r. communis at 2, 5 and 10% presented action against s. mutans, s. aureaus and e. faecallis. the experimental dentifrices showed no antimicrobial activity against candida spp. and e. coli in any of the tested concentrations. trihydral was the most effective. comparing the experimental dentifrices, the product with 10% r. communis produced the largest zones of bacterial growth inhibition and had similar antimicrobial activity to the commercial dentifrices, except against s. aureus.

TI  == oligomerization of esculin improves its antibacterial activity and modulates antibiotic resistance.
AB  == in this particular study, the antibacterial activity of esculin and oligomer fractions was assessed. mic values of esculin and its oligomer fractions as well  as of some antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative strains and against escherichia coli multiresistant variants were determined by the standard  broth microdilution method. both esculin and oligoesculin fractions exhibited antibacterial effect against reference strains; staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enteritidis and salmonella typhimurium. it appears that e3 oligomer fraction had the greatest antibacterial activity against these reference strains. besides, as e2 and e3 revealed the best antibacterial effect against multiresistant variants of e. coli, we decided to test the effect  of each, combined to the antibiotic against which the variants were resistant. in the interaction study, e2 and e3 oligoesculin fractions were found to be effective in reducing the resistance of e. coli 6574 to ofloxacin and the resistance of e. coli 6228 to amoxicillin. only e3 oligoesculin fraction showed a synergetic interaction with amoxicillin and tetracyclin against e. coli 6708, but no interaction was found either with e2 or e3 fractions against e. coli 6234. our study allowed us to conclude that oligomerization of esculin increases its antibacterial potential, according to the degree of polymerization.

TI  == monotreme lactation protein is highly expressed in monotreme milk and provides antimicrobial protection.
AB  == monotremes (platypus and echidna) are the descendants of the oldest ancestor of all extant mammals distinguished from other mammals by mode of reproduction. monotremes lay eggs following a short gestation period and after an even briefer  incubation period, altricial hatchlings are nourished over a long lactation period with milk secreted by nipple-less mammary patches located on the female's  abdomen. milk is the sole source of nutrition and immune protection for the developing young until weaning. using transcriptome and mass spectrometry analysis of milk cells and milk proteins, respectively, a novel monotreme lactation protein (mlp) was identified as a major secreted protein in milk. we show that platypus and short-beaked echidna mlp genes show significant homology and are unique to monotremes. the mlp transcript was shown to be expressed in a variety of tissues; however, highest expression was observed in milk cells and was expressed constitutively from early to late lactation. analysis of recombinant mlp showed that it is an n-linked glycosylated protein and biophysical studies predicted that mlp is an amphipathic, alpha-helical protein,  a typical feature of antimicrobial proteins. functional analysis revealed mlp antibacterial activity against both opportunistic pathogenic staphylococcus aureus and commensal enterococcus faecalis bacteria but showed no effect on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and salmonella enterica. our data suggest that mlp is an evolutionarily ancient component of milk-mediated innate immunity absent in other mammals. we propose that mlp evolved specifically in the monotreme lineage supporting the evolution of lactation in these species to provide bacterial protection, at a time when mammals lacked nipples.

TI  == plasma components and platelet activation are essential for the antimicrobial properties of autologous platelet-rich plasma: an in vitro study.
AB  == autologous platelet concentrates are successfully adopted in a variety of medical fields to stimulate bone and soft tissue regeneration. the rationale for their use consists in the delivery of a wide range of platelet-derived bioactive molecules that promotes wound healing. in addition, antimicrobial properties of platelet concentrates have been pointed out. in this study, the effect of the platelet concentration, of the activation step and of the presence of plasmatic components on the antimicrobial activity of pure platelet-rich plasma was investigated against gram positive bacteria isolated from oral cavity. the antibacterial activity, evaluated as the minimum inhibitory concentration, was determined through the microdilution two-fold serial method. results seem to suggest that the antimicrobial activity of platelet-rich plasma against enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus oralis and staphylococcus aureus is sustained by a co-operation between plasma components and platelet-derived factors and that the activation of coagulation is a fundamental step. the findings of this study may have practical implications in the modality of application of platelet concentrates.

TI  == development of a calcium phosphate nanocomposite for fast fluorogenic detection of bacteria.
AB  == current procedures for the detection and identification of bacterial infections are laborious, time-consuming, and require a high workload and well-equipped laboratories. therefore the work presented herein developed a simple, fast, and low cost method for bacterial detection based on hydroxyapatite nanoparticles with a nutritive mixture and the fluorogenic substrate. calcium phosphate ceramic nanoparticles were characterized and integrated with a nutritive mixture for the  early detection of bacteria by visual as well as fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. the composite was obtained by combining calcium phosphate nanoparticles (ca:p ratio, 1.33:1) with a nutritive mixture of protein hydrolysates and carbon sources, which promote fast bacterial multiplication, and the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbellipheryl-beta-d-glucuronide (mug). the composite had an average particle size of 173.2 nm and did not show antibacterial activity against gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria. after an escherichia coli suspension was in contact with the composite for 60-90 min, fluorescence detected under uv light or by fluorescence spectrophotometer indicated the presence of bacteria. intense fluorescence was observed after incubation for a maximum of 90 min. thus, this calcium phosphate nanocomposite system may be useful as a model for the development of other nanoparticle composites for detection of early bacterial adhesion.

TI  == antibacterial validation of electrogenerated hypochlorite using carbon-based electrodes.
AB  == this proof-of-concept study explores the novel use of carbon-based electrodes for the electrochemical generation of hypochlorite and compares the antimicrobial efficacy against commercial hypochlorite solution. antimicrobial concentrations of hypochlorite were generated using pad-printed carbon and carbon fibre electrodes, yielding up to 0.027% hypochlorite in 60 min and 0.1% hypochlorite in 15 min, respectively, in a nondivided assembly. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the electrogenerated hypochlorite produced using carbon fibre electrodes was established for four medically important bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus approx. 0.025%, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis approx. 0.012%) and found to be in agreement with  those determined using commercial hypochlorite solution. therefore, carbon-based  electrodes, particularly carbon fibre, have proven effective for the generation of antimicrobial concentrations of hypochlorite. the similarity of the mic values to commercial hypochlorite solutions suggests that the antimicrobial efficacy is  derived from the quantified hypochlorite generated and not due to marked cogeneration of reactive oxygen species, as identified for other assemblies. as such, the application of carbon electrodes may be suitable for the local production of hypochlorite for healthcare antisepsis. significance and impact of  the study: carbon fibre electrodes can rapidly generate antimicrobial concentrations of hypochlorite; as such, these cheap and commercially available electrodes are proposed for the local production of hypochlorite for healthcare antisepsis. importantly, the antimicrobial properties of the electrochemically generated hypochlorite mirror those of commercial hypochlorite, suggesting this is not enhanced by the cogeneration of reactive oxygen species. this illustrates  the potential use of disposable carbon electrodes for localized small-volume production of hypochlorite for surface and skin cleansing, and opens a broader scope of research into the exploitation of carbon electrodes for this application.

AB  == background: the study randomly screened leaf extracts of several hundred southern african tree species against important microbial pathogens to determine which taxa have the highest activity and may yield useful products to treat infections  in the animal health market. methods: we determined the antibacterial and antifungal activity of 714 acetone leaf extracts of 537 different tree species against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans. a sensitive serial dilution microplate method was used. results: several extracts had mics as low as 0.02 mg/ml. we analysed 14 out of the 38 tree orders where we determined the activity of more than 8 different tree species representing 89% of all species examined. there were statistically significant differences in some cases. celastrales, rosales and myrtales had the highest activity against gram-positive  bacteria, the myrtales and fabales against the gram-negative bacteria and the malvales and proteales against the fungi. species present in the asterales followed by the gentiales and lamiales had the lowest activities against all the  microorganisms tested. fabales species had the highest activities against all the microorganisms tested. there was substantial selectivity in some orders. proteales species had very high activity against the fungi but very low activity  against the bacteria. the species in the celastrales and rosales had very low antifungal activity, low activity against gram-negative bacteria and very high activity against gram-positive bacteria. conclusion: against all classes of microorganisms, the four orders containing species with the highest average antimicrobial activities also contained several species with low activities against different pathogens and vice versa. these results therefore should be used with circumspection in selecting tree orders that would yield the highest probability of finding species with promising activities. nevertheless there was  a twofold increase in probability of finding extracts with interesting antifungal activity from orders with high mean activity than from orders with low mean activity. the probability increased to threefold and fivefold for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria respectively.

TI  == low-shear force associated with modeled microgravity and spaceflight does not similarly impact the virulence of notable bacterial pathogens.
AB  == as their environments change, microbes experience various threats and stressors,  and in the hypercompetitive microbial world, dynamism and the ability to rapidly  respond to such changes allow microbes to outcompete their nutrient-seeking neighbors. viewed in that light, the very difference between microbial life and death depends on effective stress response mechanisms. in addition to the more commonly studied temperature, nutritional, and chemical stressors, research has begun to characterize microbial responses to physical stress, namely low-shear stress. in fact, microbial responses to low-shear modeled microgravity (lsmmg), which emulates the microgravity experienced in space, have been studied quite widely in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. interestingly, lsmmg-induced changes in the virulence potential of several gram-negative enteric bacteria, e.g., an increased enterotoxigenic escherichia coli-mediated fluid secretion in ligated ileal loops of mice, an increased adherent invasive e. coli-mediated infectivity  of caco-2 cells, an increased salmonella typhimurium-mediated invasion of both epithelial and macrophage cells, and s. typhimurium hypervirulence phenotype in balb/c mice when infected by the intraperitoneal route. although these were some  examples where virulence of the bacteria was increased, there are instances where organisms became less virulent under lsmmg, e.g., hypovirulence of yersinia pestis in cell culture infections and hypovirulence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes in a caenorhabditis elegans infection model. in general, a number of lsmmg-exposed bacteria (but not all) seemed better equipped to handle subsequent stressors such as osmotic shock, acid shock, heat shock, and exposure to chemotherapeutics. this mini-review primarily discusses both lsmmg-induced as well as bona fide spaceflight-specific alterations in bacterial virulence potential, demonstrating  that pathogens' responses to low-shear forces vary dramatically. ultimately, a careful characterization of numerous bacterial pathogens' responses to low-shear  forces is necessary to evaluate a more complete picture of how this physical stress impacts bacterial virulence since a "one-size-fits-all" response is clearly not the case.

TI  == biofilm-eradicating properties of quaternary ammonium amphiphiles: simple mimics  of antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are difficult to eradicate because of reduced antibiotic sensitivity and altered metabolic processes; thus, the development of new approaches to biofilm eradication is urgently needed. antimicrobial peptides (amps) and quaternary ammonium cations (qacs) are distinct, yet well-known, classes of antibacterial compounds. by mapping the general regions of charge and  hydrophobicity of qacs onto amp structures, we designed a small library of qacs to serve as simple amp mimics. in order to explore the role that cationic charge  plays in biofilm eradication, structures were varied with respect to cationic character, distribution of charge, and alkyl side chain. the reported compounds possess minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (mbec) as low as 25 mum against gram-positive biofilms, making them the most active anti-biofilm structures reported to date. these potent amp mimics were synthesized in 1-2 steps and hint at the minimal structural requirements for biofilm destruction.

TI  == bacteriology of pressure ulcers in individuals with spinal cord injury: what we know and what we should know.
AB  == individuals with spinal cord injury (sci) are at increased risk for the development of pressure ulcers. these chronic wounds are debilitating and contribute to prolonged hospitalization and worse medical outcome. however, the species of bacteria and the role that specific species may play in delaying the healing of chronic pressure ulcers in the sci population has not been well characterized. this study will review the literature regarding what is known currently about the bacteriology of pressure ulcers in individuals with sci. an electronic literature search of medline (1966 to february 2014) was performed. eleven studies detailing bacterial cultures of pressure ulcers in the sci population met inclusion criteria and were selected for review. among these studies, bacterial cultures were often polymicrobial with both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria identified with culture techniques that varied significantly.  the most common organisms identified in pressure ulcers were staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis. in  general, wounds were poorly characterized with minimal to no physical description and/or location provided. our present understanding of factors that may alter the microbiome of pressure ulcers in individuals with sci is quite rudimentary, at best. well-designed studies are needed to assess appropriate wound culture technique, the impact of bacterial composition on wound healing, development of infection, and the optimum medical and surgical approaches to wound care.

TI  == quantification of polyphenols and evaluation of antimicrobial, analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous and acetone-water extracts of libidibia ferrea, parapiptadenia rigida and psidium guajava.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: vast numbers of plant species from northeastern brazil have not yet been phytochemically or biologically evaluated. aim of the study: the goal of this work was to obtain, characterize and show the antimicrobial, analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous and acetone-water extracts of libidibia ferrea, parapiptadenia rigida and psidium guajava. materials and methods: the plant material (100g) was dried, and the crude extracts were obtained by using turbo-extraction (10%; w/v) with water or acetone:water (7:3, v/v) as the extraction solvent. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) methods were used to screen the crude extracts for hydrolysable tannins (gallic acid) and condensed tannins (catechins). the antibacterial activity was evaluated by agar-diffusion and microdilution methods  against gram-positive strains (staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, staphylococcus epidermidis incqs 00016, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 and a clinical isolate  of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) as well as gram-negative strains  (escherichia coli atcc 25922, salmonella enteritidis incqs 00258, shigella flexneri and klebsiella pneumoniae). to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity,  a leukocyte migration model was used. analgesic activity was determined by the hot plate test and the acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing test. data were analyzed by analysis of variance (anova) at a significance level of 5%. results:  parapiptadenia rigida presented the highest amount of total polyphenols (35.82 +/- 0.20%), while the greatest catechin content was found in the acetone-water extract of psidium guajava (eawpg; 1.04 mug/g). the largest amounts of catechins  were found in the aqueous extract of libidibia ferrea (ealf; 1.07 mug/g) and the  acetone-water extract of parapiptadenia rigida (eawpr; 1.0 mug/g). all extracts showed activity against gram-positive bacteria. the aqueous and acetone-water extracts of psidium guajava showed the greatest inhibition zones in the agar diffusion tests. in the evaluation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), the most susceptible gram-positive bacterium was staphylococcus epidermidis and the most susceptible gram-negative bacterium was shigella flexneri. eapg and eawpg showed the greatest mic values. all extracts were significant inhibitors of leukocyte migration (p<0.05). using the writhing test, significant analgesic activity was found for eapr (50 mg/kg), eawpr (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) and eawpg (50 mg/kg) (p<0.05). conclusions: thus, the appropriate extraction procedure preserves the chemical components such as gallic acid and catechin, and showed antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.

TI  == whole-animal chemical screen identifies colistin as a new immunomodulator that targets conserved pathways.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to take advantage of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans to perform a whole-animal chemical screen to identify potential immune activators that may confer protection against bacterial infections. we identified 45 marketed drugs, out of 1,120 studied compounds, that are capable of activating a conserved p38/pmk-1 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway required for innate immunity. one of these drugs, the last-resort antibiotic colistin, protected against infections by the gram-negative pathogens yersinia pestis and pseudomonas aeruginosa but not by the gram-positive pathogens enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. protection was independent of the antibacterial activity of colistin, since the drug was administered prophylactically prior to the infections and it was also effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. immune activation by colistin is mediated not only by the p38/pmk-1 pathway but also by the conserved foxo transcription factor daf-16 and the transcription factor skn-1. furthermore, p38/pmk-1 was found to be required in the intestine for immune activation by colistin. enhanced p38/pmk-1-mediated immune responses by colistin did not reduce the bacterial burden, indicating that the pathway plays a role in the development of host tolerance to infections by gram-negative bacteria. importance: the innate immune  system represents the front line of our defenses against invading microorganisms. given the ever-increasing resistance to antibiotics developed by bacterial pathogens, the possibility of boosting immune defenses represents an interesting, complementary approach to conventional antibiotic treatments. here we report that the antibiotic colistin can protect against infections by a mechanism that is independent of its microbicidal activity. prophylactic treatment with colistin activates a conserved p38/pmk-1 pathway in the intestine that helps the host better tolerate a bacterial infection. since p38/pmk-1-mediated immune responses  appear to be conserved from plants to mammals, colistin may also activate immunity in higher organisms, including humans. antibiotics with immunomodulatory properties have the potential of improving the long-term outcome of patients with chronic infectious diseases.

TI  == bacteriophages as an alternative strategy for fighting biofilm development.
AB  == the ability of microbes to form biofilms is an important element of their pathogenicity, and biofilm formation is a serious challenge for today's medicine. fighting the clinical complications associated with biofilm formation is very difficult and linked to a high risk of failure, especially in a time of increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. bacterial species most commonly isolated from biofilms include coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. the frequent failure of antibiotic therapy led researchers to look for alternative methods and experiment with the use of antibacterial factors with a mechanism of action different from that of antibiotics. experimental studies with bacteriophages and mixtures thereof, expressing lytic properties against numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species showed that bacteriophages may both prevent biofilm formation and contribute to eradication of biofilm bacteria. a specific role is played here by phage depolymerases, which facilitate the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances (eps) and thus the permeation of bacteriophages into deeper biofilm layers and lysis of the susceptible bacterial  cells. much hope is placed in genetic modifications of bacteriophages that would  allow the equipping bacteriophages with the function of depolymerase synthesis. the use of phage cocktails prevents the development of phage-resistant bacteria.

TI  == development of a multiplex real-time pcr assay for the rapid diagnosis of neonatal late onset sepsis.
AB  == the diagnosis of late onset sepsis (los), a severe condition with high prevalence in preterm infants, is hampered by the suboptimal sensitivity and long turnaround time of blood culture. detection of the infecting pathogen directly in blood by pcr would provide a much more timely result. unfortunately, pcr-based assays reported so far are labor intensive and often lack direct species identification. therefore we developed a real-time multiplex pcr assay tailored to los diagnosis  which is easy-to-use, is applicable on small blood volumes and provides species-specific results within 4h. species-specific pcr assays were selected from literature or developed using bioinformatic tools for the detection of the most prevalent etiologic pathogens: enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus spp., streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp. and serratia marcescens. the pcr assays showed 100% specificity, full coverage of the target pathogens and a limit of detection (lod) of </=10cfueq./reaction. these lod values were maintained in the multiplex format or when bacterial dna was isolated from blood. clinical evaluation showed high concordance between the multiplex pcr and blood culture. in conclusion, we developed a multiplex pcr that allows the direct detection of the most important  bacterial pathogens causing los in preterm infants.

TI  == [neonatal bacteremia--frequency, spectrum of organisms and correlation between clinical symptoms and laboratory data for early onset sepsis].
AB  == improved obstetrical management and evidence-based peripartum antimicrobial therapy in the last decades reduce the frequency of early-onset neonatal sepsis (eons) and improve the outcome. the spectrum of the microrganisms is different according to regions, countries and periods of time. appropriate diagnosis and treatment improve the outcome. however dissociation often occurs between clinical manifestation, laboratory and microbiological findings. aims: to determine the incidence of neonatal bacteremia in our hospital, to identify the spectrum of organisms from positive blood cultures (bc), to analyze the correlation between clinical manifestation of eos and/or laboratory abnormalities. patients and methods: this study was carried out at the university hospital of obstetrics and  gynecology "maichin dom"- sofia for 2012. from all 4081 inborn babies 848 were at risk for maternal-fetal infection. in the first two hours after birth they were screened for eons using a panel of microbiological probes and laboratory blood tests, followed up the next days. according the guidelines of the neonatology clinic a standard antibiotic therapy was started. 43 of the screened infants (1.05% of all inborn babies) had positive bc and were enrolled in this study. results: sixteen from the 43 babies with positive bc were with birthweight > 2500g (0.48% from all 3316 life born term infants), 27--with birthweight < 2500g  (3.5% from all 765 low birthweight babies), 24 were patients of the nicu (3.8% of all 635 babies admitted at the nicu for 2012). no one died. the following groups  of organisms in bc were isolated: 24 bc with coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicilline sensitive (mscons)--11 of them without any clinical symptoms and laboratory abnormalities were interpreted as result of contamination, 1 bc with staphylococcus aureus ms (mssa), 8 with alpha-streptococci, 5 with enterococcus faecalis (1 in combination with mscons), 2 with gbs, 2 with aerococcus urinae and 2 bc with listeria monocytogenes. gram-negative organisms were not found in bc after birth. 30 from the infants with positive bc didn't show any clinical symptom of eons. 20 of them were without laboratory criteria for infection and were discharged after negative bc control. 10 newborns were with transient elevation of crp but without clinical symptoms. 13 babies showed clinical symptoms of eos, 3 of them had transient respiratory failure, but negative laboratory criteria. 10 babies met the clinical and laboratory criteria for eons; in 8 of them the crp was significantly elevated. most critically ill were 3 elbw  and elga babies: 2 twins with listeria and 1 baby with mssa-eons. conclusions: in our study, cons were found to be the most common cause of eons or bacteremia, low incidence of gbs sepsis was established. almost the half of the babies with positive bc were asymptomatic and without laboratory data for infection. elevation of the crp-value was the most frequent laboratory abnormality in symptomatic infants.

TI  == inspecting the potential physiological and biomedical value of 44 conserved uncharacterised proteins of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: the major gram-positive coccoid pathogens cause similar invasive diseases and show high rates of antimicrobial resistance. uncharacterised proteins shared by these organisms may be involved in virulence or be targets for antimicrobial therapy. results: forty four uncharacterised proteins from streptococcus pneumoniae with homologues in enterococcus faecalis and/or staphylococcus aureus were selected for analysis. these proteins showed differences in terms of sequence conservation and number of interacting partners. twenty eight of these proteins were monodomain proteins and 16 were modular, involving domain combinations and, in many cases, predicted unstructured regions. the genes coding for four of these 44 proteins were essential. genomic and structural studies showed one of the four essential genes to code for a promising antibacterial target. the strongest impact of gene removal was on monodomain proteins showing high sequence conservation and/or interactions with many other proteins. eleven out of 40 knockouts (one for each gene) showed growth delay and  10 knockouts presented a chaining phenotype. five of these chaining mutants showed a lack of putative dna-binding proteins. this suggest this phenotype results from a loss of overall transcription regulation. five knockouts showed defective autolysis in response to penicillin and vancomycin, and attenuated virulence in an animal model of sepsis. conclusions: uncharacterised proteins make up a reservoir of polypeptides of different physiological importance and biomedical potential. a promising antibacterial target was identified. five of the 44 examined proteins seemed to be virulence factors.

TI  == beyond paraquats: dialkyl 3,3'- and 3,4'-bipyridinium amphiphiles as antibacterial agents.
AB  == dialkyl 4,4'-bipyridinium compounds, known as 'paraquats' (pqs), have a long history of use as herbicides, as redox indicators, and more recently as potent antibacterial agents. however, due to their ability to form reactive oxygen species (ros) in vivo, pqs are also known to be toxic. we proposed that altering  the electrochemical properties of pq, specifically by preparing isomeric bipyridinium structures with 3,3'- and 3,4'-substitution of the nitrogen heteroatoms on the biaryl core, would maintain antibacterial activity, yet decrease toxicity. we have thus prepared a series of 17 amphiphiles, dubbed 'metaquat' (mq) and 'parametaquat' (pmq), respectively, and investigated their antibacterial and electrochemical properties. optimal inhibition of bacterial growth was observed in symmetric, biscationic structures; minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values measured as low as 0.5 mum against both gram-positive  and gram-negative bacteria for the compound pmq-11,11. electrochemical analysis demonstrated the redox properties of the dialkyl 3,3'- and 3,4'-bipyridinium amphiphiles to be distinct from those of the 4,4'-bipyridinium isomer. thus mq and pmq amphiphiles maintain the strong antibacterial activity of the pq isomers, but show promise for reduced ros toxicity.

TI  == improved antibacterial behavior of titanium surface with torularhodin-polypyrrole film.
AB  == the problem of microorganisms attaching and proliferating on implants and medical devices surfaces is still attracting interest in developing research on different coatings based on antibacterial agents. the aim of this work is centered on modifying titanium (ti) based implants surfaces through incorporation of a natural compound with antimicrobial effect, torularhodin (t), by means of a polypyrrole (ppy) film. this study tested the potential antimicrobial activity of the new coating against a range of standard bacterial strains: escherichia coli,  staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the morphology, physical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized films were assessed by sem, afm, uv-vis, ftir and cyclic voltammetry. in addition, biocompatibility of this new coating was evaluated using l929 mouse  fibroblast cells. the results showed that ppy-torularhodin composite film acts as a corrosion protective coating with antibacterial activity and it has no harmful  effect on cell viability.

TI  == antibacterial efficiency of vermiculite/chlorhexidine nanocomposites and results  of the in vivo test of harmlessness of vermiculite.
AB  == clay minerals have been proposed as very useful materials for modulating drug delivery. these are the commonly used materials in pharmaceutical production both as inorganic carriers or active agents. we focused on the development of suitable long-acting material for local treatment of oral infection where clay minerals act as inorganic drug carriers. organovermiculites with antibacterial activity were prepared by ion exchange reactions using different concentrations of chlorhexidine diacetate. the samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction (xrd), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) and thermal analysis (tga). the antibacterial activity was evaluated by finding the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). all studied organoclays possessed good antibacterial activity after 24h exposure against escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and particularly against staphylococcus aureus. pseudomonas aeruginosa however proved very resistant as only the sample with the highest concentration of ca that successfully inhibited bacterial growth. furthermore, clay mineral vermiculite was subjected to in vivo toxicological analysis and its influence on gastrointestinal tract during its oral application was investigated. tissue samples from buccal mucosa, tongue, esophagus, stomach, terminal duodenum, small  intestine, caecum, distal colon and liver were subjected to histological examination, both macroscopically and microscopically. neither systemic nor local reactions were observed. therefore the toxicity of vermiculite to a mammal model  organism can be excluded.

TI  == novel nonribosomal peptide synthetase (nrps) genes sequenced from intertidal mudflat bacteria.
AB  == nonribosomal peptide synthetases (nrps) are actively sought out, due to pharmacologically important activities of their metabolites. in marine environment, the most prevalent nonribosomal peptide antibiotic producers are sponges inhabiting microorganisms. conversely, strains from marine sediments and  more especially from intertidal mudflats have not been extensively screened for the presence of new nrps. in this study, for the first time, a collection of one  hundred intertidal mudflat bacterial isolates (marennes-oleron bay, france) was assessed for (1) the presence of nrps genes by degenerated pcr targeting conserved adenylation domains and (2) for their production of antimicrobial molecules. (1) bacteria with adenylation domains (14 strains) were identified by  16s rrna gene sequence analysis and grouped into firmicutes (one strain) and proteobacteria (13 strains). in silico analysis of the nrps amino acid sequences  (n = 7) showed 41-58% id with sequences found in the ncbi database. three new putative adenylation domain signatures were found. (2) the culture supernatant of one of these strains, identified as a bacillus, was shown to strongly inhibit the growth of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, and enterococcus faecalis. this  study portends that the intertidal mudflat niche could be of interest for the discovery of new nrps genes and antimicrobial producing strains.

TI  == screening and characterisation of antimicrobial properties of semisynthetic betulin derivatives.
AB  == betulin (lup-20(29)-ene-3beta, 28-diol) is a naturally occurring triterpene, which is found in substantial amounts from the outer bark of birch trees. a library of 51 structurally diverse semisynthetic betulin derivatives was screened against five bacterial strains, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and a fungal strain candida albicans, using broth microdilution assays. primary antimicrobial  screening at 50 microm concentration led to the identification of five compounds  showing antimicrobial properties (inhibition of growth by >70% against one or more microbial strains). according to the dose-response results, 28-o-(n-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (compound 5) was the most active, showing mic90 of 6.25 microm against two gram-positive bacteria, e. faecalis and s. aureus. however, the activity of this compound was affected by albumin binding, which was demonstrated by the loss of activity in a host-pathogen co-culture assay as well as in the antibacterial assay in the presence of increased concentration of albumin. furthermore, the effects on mammalian cells were evaluated by cytotoxicity assessment on hepatocyte cell culture after 24 h exposure to the compounds. betulinic aldehyde (18), betulin-28-oxime (31) and hetero cycloadduct with acetoxy groups at carbon atoms 3 and 28 and ethyl substituent at the triazolo ring (43) displayed cytotoxicity towards hepatocytes, with ic50 values of 47, 25 and 16 microm, respectively. the ic50 value for 28-o-(n-acetylanthraniloyl)betulin (5) was 56 microm. the current study presents  an insight into using betulin scaffold for developing derivatives with antibacterial potential, and furthermore the necessity of in-depth analysis of found actives through selectivity profiling and follow-up studies including in silico admet predictions.

TI  == using color histograms and spa-lda to classify bacteria.
AB  == in this work, a new approach is proposed to verify the differentiating characteristics of five bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, and staphylococcus aureus) by using digital images obtained with a simple webcam and variable selection by the  successive projections algorithm associated with linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda). in this sense, color histograms in the red-green-blue (rgb), hue-saturation-value (hsv), and grayscale channels and their combinations were used as input data, and statistically evaluated by using different multivariate classifiers (soft independent modeling by class analogy (simca), principal component analysis-linear discriminant analysis (pca-lda), partial least squares  discriminant analysis (pls-da) and successive projections algorithm-linear discriminant analysis (spa-lda)). the bacteria strains were cultivated in a nutritive blood agar base layer for 24 h by following the brazilian pharmacopoeia, maintaining the status of cell growth and the nature of nutrient solutions under the same conditions. the best result in classification was obtained by using rgb and spa-lda, which reached 94 and 100 % of classification accuracy in the training and test sets, respectively. this result is extremely positive from the viewpoint of routine clinical analyses, because it avoids bacterial identification based on phenotypic identification of the causative organism using gram staining, culture, and biochemical proofs. therefore, the proposed method presents inherent advantages, promoting a simpler, faster, and low-cost alternative for bacterial identification.

TI  == mechanisms of vancomycin resistance in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic used for the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections. traditionally, it has been used as a drug of last resort; however, clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)  strains with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (vancomycin intermediate-resistant s. aureus [visa]) and more recently with high-level vancomycin resistance (vancomycin-resistant s. aureus [vrsa]) have been described in the clinical literature. the rare vrsa strains carry transposon tn1546, acquired from vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, which is known to alter cell wall structure and metabolism, but the resistance mechanisms in visa isolates are less well defined. herein, we review selected mechanistic aspects of resistance in visa and summarize biochemical studies on cell wall synthesis in a  vrsa strain. finally, we recapitulate a model that integrates common mechanistic  features of vrsa and visa strains and is consistent with the mode of action of vancomycin.

AB  == beneficial interactions between plants and microorganisms have been investigated  under different ecological, physiological, biochemical, and genetic aspects. however, the systematic exploration of biomolecules with potential for biotechnological products from this interaction still is relatively scarce. therefore, this study aimed the evaluation of the diversity and antimicrobial activity of the endophytic fungi obtained from roots, stems and leafs of myrcia guianensis (myrtaceae) from the brazilian amazon. 156 endophytic fungi were isolated and above 80% were identified by morphological examination as belonging  to the genera pestalotiopsis, phomopsis, aspergillus, xylaria, nectria, penicillium and fusarium. fermented broth of those fungi were assayed for antimicrobial activity and four inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans and penicillium avellaneum. as the strain named mgre2.2.3b (nectria haematococca) had shown the most promising results against those pathogenic strains, its fermented broth was fractioned and only its two low polar fractions demonstrated to be active. both fractions exhibited a minimum bactericidal concentration of 50 mug.ml(-1) against s. aureus and a minimum fungicidal concentration of 100 mug.ml(-1) against p. avellaneum. these results demonstrate the diversity of fungal genera in m. guianensis and the potential of these endophytic fungi for the production of new antibiotics.

TI  == effect of addition of 2% chlorhexidine or 10% doxycycline on antimicrobial activity of biodentine.
AB  == aim: the purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the addition of  2% chlorhexidine gluconate or 10% doxycycline would enhance the antimicrobial activity of biodentine against staphylococcus aureus (atcc-25923), enterococcus faecalis (atcc-29212), candida albicans (atcc-90028), and streptococcus mutans (mtcc-497). materials and methods: three wells of 4 mm diameter and 4 mm depth on each plate were prepared on the agar medium with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. biodentine powder mixed with 2% chlorhexidine (0.06 g) or 10% doxycycline (0.30 g) in its liquid or liquid alone was placed to fill each well.  plates were incubated at 37 degrees c as required for microbial growth. a blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. the data were analyzed using independent "t" test to compare the differences among the three cement preparations for different micro-organisms. results: all biodentine samples inhibited microbial growth. the highest mean diameters of zone of inhibition for all the micro-organisms were found around biodentine/chlorhexidine (13.417) followed by biodentine alone (12.236) and biodentine/doxycycline (11.25). conclusion: in conclusion, adding 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in liquid of biodentine enhanced the antimicrobial activity of biodentine against all the tested micro-organisms except candida albicans, while addition of 10% doxycycline decreased the antimicrobial activity of biodentine. the differences were significant statistically (p < 0.05).

TI  == use of a dissolved oxygen microsensor for assessing the viability and thickness of microbial biofilm on root surfaces.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the use of a dissolved oxygen microsensor (doms) for assessing the viability and thickness of microbial biofilms on the apical external surface  of contaminated human tooth roots. methodology: apical biofilm formation was evaluated in 15 roots contaminated in vitro with a polymicrobial mixture of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida  albicans for 7, 21 and 60 days and in three freshly extracted roots with associated radiographically visible periapical lesions. in each root, the thickness and viability (measured by the amount of dissolved oxygen) of biofilm formed on the apical 2 mm were examined with the doms. scanning electron microscopy (sem) was used as an auxiliary analysis to confirm the existence of the biofilms detected by the doms. results: the doms detected dissolved oxygen on the biofilms formed on the three residual roots up to thickness of 375 mum, 480 mum and 1650 mum. in the 15 roots contaminated in vitro, the doms detected dissolved oxygen in six specimens up to thicknesses from 75 to 250 mum, and the intensity of the metabolic activity (biofilm thickness) was directly proportional to the contamination time. sem confirmed the presence of biofilm in all roots. conclusion: the dissolved oxygen microsensor allowed the measurement of the amount of dissolved oxygen in the biofilm, which is indicative of the intensity of the microbial metabolic activity (viability), correlating the results with biofilm thickness. the doms was effective in freshly extracted roots, but had limitations in roots contaminated in vitro after short periods (7 and 21 days) of contamination.

TI  == bacteriology and drug susceptibility analysis of pus from patients with severe intra-abdominal infection induced by abdominal trauma.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to retrospectively analyze the bacteriology and  drug susceptibility of pus flora from abdominal trauma patients with severe intra-abdominal infection (siai). a total of 41 patients with siai induced by abdominal trauma were enrolled in the study, from which 123 abdominal pus samples were obtained. the results from laboratory microbiology and drug sensitivity were subjected to susceptibility analysis using whonet software. a total of 297 strains were isolated in which gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria and fungi accounted for 53.5 (159/297), 44.1 (131/297) and 0.7% (2/297), respectively. anaerobic bacteria accounted for 1.7%. the five predominant bacteria were escherichia coli (e. coli), staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae), enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa). e. coli was highly susceptible to cefoperazone (91%)  and imipenem (98%), while gram-positive cocci were highly susceptible to teicoplanin (100%) and linezolid (100%). s. aureus was 100% susceptible to vancomycin and k. pneumoniae was highly susceptible to imipenem (100%) and amikacin (79%). p. aeruginosa was the most susceptible to ciprofloxacin (90%). gram-negative bacterial infection was present in the majority of cases of siai. however, a large number of patients were infected by gram-positive bacteria, particularly s. aureus that exhibited significant resistance to penicillin (100%), oxacillin (100%) and a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic cefotaxime (95%). amongst the pathogenic bacteria that cause siai, both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria account for a high proportion, so high-level and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initially used.

TI  == influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  == the results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. to be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (da) and molecular weights (mw) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. they were tested at different ph values for their antimicrobial activities against four gram-negative bacteria  (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhi), four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (aspergillus niger, fusarium oxysporum and alternaria solani). chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (da and mw) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower da and the lower ph give the larger efficiency. antibacterial activity was further enhanced for gram-negative bacteria with decreasing mw, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the gram-positive. concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. fungal growth decreased with increasing mw for f. oxysporum and decreasing da for a. solani, but no mw or da dependences were observed with a. niger.

TI  == determination of kinetics and the crystal structure of a novel type 2 isopentenyl diphosphate: dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase from streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (idi) is a key enzyme in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway and is required for all organisms that synthesize isoprenoid metabolites from mevalonate. type 1 idi (idi-1) is a metalloprotein that is found in eukaryotes, whereas the type 2 isoform (idi-2) is a flavoenzyme found in bacteria that is completely absent from human. idi-2 from the pathogenic bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae was recombinantly expressed in escherichia coli. steady-state kinetic studies of the enzyme indicated that fmnh2 (km =0.3 mum) bound before isopentenyl diphosphate (km =40 mum) in an ordered binding mechanism. an x-ray crystal structure at 1.4 a resolution was obtained for the holoenzyme in the closed conformation with a reduced flavin cofactor and two sulfate ions in the active site. these results helped to further approach the enzymatic mechanism of idi-2 and, thus, open new possibilities for the rational design of antibacterial compounds against sequence-similar and structure-related  pathogens such as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == phage neutralization by sera of patients receiving phage therapy.
AB  == the aim of our investigation was to verify whether phage therapy (pt) can induce  antiphage antibodies. the antiphage activity was determined in sera from 122 patients from the phage therapy unit in wroclaw with bacterial infections before  and during pt, and in sera from 30 healthy volunteers using a neutralization test. furthermore, levels of antiphage antibodies were investigated in sera of 19 patients receiving staphylococcal phages and sera of 20 healthy volunteers using  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the phages were administered orally, locally,  orally/locally, intrarectally, or orally/intrarectally. the rate of phage inactivation (k) estimated the level of phages' neutralization by human sera. low k rates were found in sera of healthy volunteers (k </= 1.73). low k rates were detected before pt (k </= 1.64). high antiphage activity of sera k > 18 was observed in 12.3% of examined patients (n = 15) treated with phages locally (n =  13) or locally/orally (n = 2) from 15 to 60 days of pt. high k rates were found in patients treated with some staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and  enterococcus faecalis phages. low k rates were observed during pt in sera of patients using phages orally (k </= 1.04). increased inactivation of phages by sera of patients receiving pt decreased after therapy. these results suggest that the antiphage activity in patients' sera depends on the route of phage administration and phage type. the induction of antiphage activity of sera during or after pt does not exclude a favorable result of pt.

TI  == innate host defense requires tfeb-mediated transcription of cytoprotective and antimicrobial genes.
AB  == animal host defense against infection requires the expression of defense genes at the right place and the right time. understanding such tight control of host defense requires the elucidation of the transcription factors involved. by using  an unbiased approach in the model caenorhabditis elegans, we discovered that hlh-30 (known as tfeb in mammals) is a key transcription factor for host defense. hlh-30 was activated shortly after staphylococcus aureus infection, and drove the expression of close to 80% of the host response, including antimicrobial and autophagy genes that were essential for host tolerance of infection. tfeb was also rapidly activated in murine macrophages upon s. aureus infection and was required for proper transcriptional induction of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. thus, our data suggest that tfeb is a previously unappreciated, evolutionarily ancient transcription factor in the host response to infection.

TI  == linezolid update: stable in vitro activity following more than a decade of clinical use and summary of associated resistance mechanisms.
AB  == linezolid, approved for clinical use since 2000, has become an important addition to the anti-gram-positive infection armamentarium. this oxazolidinone drug has in vitro and in vivo activity against essentially all gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). the in vitro activity of linezolid was well documented prior to its clinical application, and several ongoing surveillance studies demonstrated consistent and potent results during the subsequent years of clinical use. emergence of resistance has been limited and associated with invasive procedures, deep organ involvement, presence of foreign  material and mainly prolonged therapy. non-susceptible organisms usually demonstrate alterations in the 23s rrna target, which remain the main resistance  mechanism observed in enterococci; although a few reports have described the detection of cfr-mediated resistance in enterococcus faecalis. s. aureus isolates non-susceptible to linezolid remain rare in large surveillance studies. most isolates harbour 23s rrna mutations; however, cfr-carrying mrsa isolates have been observed in the united states and elsewhere. it is still uncertain whether the occurrences of such isolates are becoming more prevalent. coagulase-negative  isolates (cons) resistant to linezolid were uncommon following clinical approval. surveillance data have indicated that cons isolates, mainly staphylococcus epidermidis, currently account for the majority of gram-positive organisms displaying elevated mic results to linezolid. in addition, these isolates frequently demonstrate complex and numerous resistance mechanisms, such as alterations in the ribosomal proteins l3 and/or l4 and/or presence of cfr and/or  modifications in 23s rrna. the knowledge acquired during the past decades on this initially used oxazolidinone has been utilized for developing new candidate agents, such as tedizolid and radezolid, and as linezolid patents soon begin to expire, generic brands will certainly become available. these events will likely  establish a new chapter for this successful class of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == multispecies biofilm in an artificial wound bed--a novel model for in vitro assessment of solid antimicrobial dressings.
AB  == wound infections represent a major problem, particularly in patients with chronic wounds. bacteria in the wound exist mainly in the form of biofilms and are thus resistant to most antibiotics and antimicrobials. a simple and cost-effective in  vitro model of chronic wound biofilms applied for testing treatments and solid devices, especially wound dressings, is presented in this work. the method is based on the well-established lubbock chronic wound biofilm transferred onto an artificial agar wound bed. the biofilm formed by four bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas  aeruginosa) was stable for up to 48h post-transplant. the applicability of the model was evaluated by testing two common iodine wound treatments. these observations indicate that this method enables assessing the effects of treatments on established resilient wound biofilms and is clinically highly relevant.

AB  == objectives: the use of metal oxide nanoparticles has attracted lots of attention, mostly because of their promising antimicrobial activity along with their biocompatibility with mammalian cells. this study aims to investigate the in vitro and ex vivo antimicrobial efficiency of nano-magnesium oxide (mgo) aqueous  solution against endodontic pathogens. materials and methods: the cytotoxicity of different concentrations of nano-mgo was assessed using lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assay (ldh assay). a comparison of the antimicrobial efficiency of several concentrations of nano-mgo solution, sodium hypochlorite (naocl), and chlorhexidine (chx) gluconate against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and candida albicans was made using the direct contact method. an ex vivo model of decoronated and experimentally infected human teeth was employed to compare the efficiency of nano-mgo (5 mg/l) solution with naocl (5.25 %) in the elimination of e. faecalis. results: there was no statistically significant difference between nano-mgo solutions (10 and 5 mg/l), 5.25 % naocl, and 2 % chx  gluconate in terms of the required time to inhibit the growth of the tested pathogens (p > 0.05). the ldh assay showed no cytotoxicity of different concentrations of nano-mgo used in this study (p < 0.001). in the ex vivo model of infected human teeth, 6 h post-irrigation, there was no statistically significant difference between colony-forming units (cfu) per milliliter of nano-mgo (5 mg/l) and naocl (5.25 %)-treated teeth (5-6 log scale reduction). however, the nano-mgo group showed a significant decrease in colony-forming units per milliliter (7 log scale), 24 h post-irrigation (p < 0.05). at other tested time points-24, 48, 72, and 168 h-the levels of cfu per milliliter were significantly less in the nano-mgo group (2-3 log scale difference) compared to the naocl group, indicating long-term antibacterial activity of nano-mgo (p < 0.05). at 72 and 168 h post-irrigation, no detectable bacterial growth was observed in the nano-mgo group. the detection limit was 10 cfu/ml. conclusions: nano-mgo aqueous solutions represent promising antimicrobial activities, both in  vitro and ex vivo with minimal toxicity. clinical relevance: compared to naocl (5.25 %), nano-mgo (5 mg/l) exhibits statistically significant long-term efficiency in the elimination of e. faecalis in the root canal system. after further investigations, nano-mgo could be considered as a new root canal irrigant.

TI  == development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-lipl32-coupled gold nanoparticles for leptospira detection.
AB  == detection of antibody specific to leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. however, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. molecular techniques  are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. in this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to lipl32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic leptospira. this coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for leptospira detection. we demonstrated that the sensitivity of leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). there was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic leptospira, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group b, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. these data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to lipl32 could  be used for leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.

TI  == antibacterial activity of tham trisphenylguanide against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == this study investigated the potential antibacterial activity of three series of compounds synthesized from 12 linear and branched polyamines with 2-8 amino groups, which were substituted to produce the corresponding guanides, biguanides, or phenylguanides, against acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. antibacterial activity was measured for each compound by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration against the bacteria, and the toxicity towards mammalian cells was  determined. the most effective compound, tham trisphenylguanide, was studied in time-to-kill and cytoplasmic leakage assays against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, usa300) in comparison to chlorhexidine. preliminary  toxicity and mrsa challenge studies in mice were also conducted on this compound. tham trisphenylguanide showed significant antibacterial activity (mic approximately 1 mg/l) and selectivity against mrsa relative to all the other bacteria examined. in time-to-kill assays it showed increased antimicrobial activity against mrsa versus chlorhexidine. it induced leakage of cytoplasmic content at concentrations that did not reduce cell viability, suggesting the mechanism of action may involve membrane disruption. using an intraperitoneal mouse model of invasive mrsa disease, tham trisphenylguanide reduced bacterial burden locally and in deeper tissues. this study has identified a novel guanide compound with selective microbicidal activity against staphylococcus aureus, including a methicillin-resistant (mrsa) strain.

(1)h and (13)c shielding tensors for crystal structure were calculated with giao/dft/b3lyp/6-311++g(d,p) methods in cdcl3. the complexes were found to have general composition [ml2]. the results of elemental analysis showed 1:2 (metal/ligand) stoichiometry for all the complex. magnetic and spectral data indicate a square planar geometry for pd(ii) complex and a distorted tetrahedral  geometry for co(ii) complexes. the ligand and its metal chelates have been screened for their antimicrobial activities using the disk diffusion method against the selected gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus,  staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, gram negative bacteria: eschericha  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia. the inhibition activities of  these compounds on carbonic anhydrase ii (ca ii) and carbonic anhydrase i (ca i)  have been investigated by comparing ic50 and ki values and it has been found that pd(ii) complex have more enzyme inhibition efficiency than salptsmh and co(ii) complex.

TI  == isolation and biological activity of compounds from garcinia preussii.
AB  == context: plants of the genus garcinia (clusiaceae) are traditionally used to relieve stomachaches, toothaches, and as a chew stick. objective: in order to determine which compounds were responsible for these activities, a phytochemical  investigation of the fruits and leaves of garcinia preussii engl. was pursued. materials and methods: plants were extracted by solvents of various polarities. compounds isolation was then carried out using chromatography methods (medium- and high-pressure liquid chromatography, open column and thin-layer chromatography). the isolated compounds were identified and characterized by using 1d and 2d nmr spectroscopies. the antioxidant activity was evaluated using  dpph(*), abts(*-), alp, and orac assays. the antimicrobial activity was assayed against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value. the cytotoxic activity of most of the isolated compounds was evaluated on  a small panel of human cancer cell lines (du145, hela, ht-29, and a431) using the xtt method. results: the phytochemical investigation of g. preussii led to the isolation of eight known compounds, six benzophenones and two flavonoids. these compounds were tested for their biological activities. 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 demonstrated a high free radical scavenging activity with er50 ranging from 0.1 to 0.7. the antimicrobial activity was shown only against gram-positive bacteria  for 1, 4, and 5. a moderate cytotoxic activity with ic50 ranging from 7 to 50 microm was observed, except for 6 which was not active. conclusion: these results appear to support some of the properties reported for garcinia species.

TI  == paenibacterin, a novel broad-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic, neutralises endotoxins and promotes survival in a murine model of pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced sepsis.
AB  == paenibacterin, produced by paenibacillus thiaminolyticus osy-se, is active both against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. paenibacterin showed relatively low cytotoxicity against a human kidney cell line (atcc crl-2190), with a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50)>/=109mug/ml. the cationic paenibacterin molecule binds to the negatively charged gram-negative endotoxins in vitro, suggesting that paenibacterin can neutralise lipopolysaccharides. in a murine septic shock model, two 500mug doses of paenibacterin significantly increased the survival of mice challenged with a lethal level of p. aeruginosa. considering that paenibacterin is effective against many strains of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, this study suggests that  this antimicrobial agent is a promising candidate as a new drug.

TI  == colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-s. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of streptococcus suis.
AB  == a rapid diagnosis kit that detects streptococcus suis (s. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ics) test was developed in this study. the ics test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pabs) against s. suis. the pabs were developed from rabbits immunised with s. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (cps). development of the pabs was investigated to establish their binding to cps and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ics test. the results of the ics optimisation revealed that the combinations of pab c-n1 and pab c-n2 had the  highest sensitivity to cps. the minimum limitation of ics sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu) and a cps concentration of 0.05 microg. the assay time for detection of s. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. a cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae). the cross-reactivity of other serotypes in s. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. this study presents the first report of a development of an ics that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. the s. suis ics provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.

TI  == antibacterial activity of kaolinite/nanotio2 composites in relation to irradiation time.
AB  == the paper addresses laboratory preparation and antibacterial activity testing of  kaolinite/nanotio2 composite in respect of the daylight irradiation time. kaolinite/nanotio2 composites with 20 and 40 wt% of tio2 were laboratory prepared, dried at 105 degrees c and calcined at 600 degrees c. the calcination caused transformation of kaolinite to metakaolinite and origination of the metakaolinite/nanotio2 composite. x-ray powder diffraction, raman and ftir spectroscopic methods revealed titanium dioxide only in the form of anatase in all evaluated samples (non-calcined and calcined) and also transformation of kaolinite to metakaolinite after the calcination treatment. scanning electron microscopy was used as a method for characterization of morphology and elemental  composition of the studied samples. a standard microdilution test was used to determine the antibacterial activity using four human pathogenic bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa). a lamp with a wide spectrum bulb simulating daylight was used for induction of photocatalysis. the antibacterial assays found all the kati samples to have antibacterial potency with different onset of the activity when calcined samples exhibited antibacterial activity earlier than the non-calcined.  significant difference in antibacterial activity of kati samples for different bacterial strains was not observed.

TI  == antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities of pr-39 derived peptides.
AB  == the porcine cathelicidin pr-39 is a host defence peptide that plays a pivotal role in the innate immune defence of the pig against infections. besides direct antimicrobial activity, it is involved in immunomodulation, wound healing and several other biological processes. in this study, the antimicrobial- and immunomodulatory activity of pr-39, and n- and c-terminal derivatives of pr-39 were tested. pr-39 exhibited an unexpected broad antimicrobial spectrum including several gram positive strains such as bacillus globigii and enterococcus faecalis. of organisms tested, only staphylococcus aureus was insensitive to pr-39. truncation of pr-39 down to 15 (n-terminal) amino acids did not lead to major loss of activity, while peptides corresponding to the c-terminal part of pr-39 were hampered in their antimicrobial activity. however, shorter peptides were all much more sensitive to inhibition by salt. active peptides induced atp leakage and loss of membrane potential in bacillus globigii and escherichia coli, indicating a lytic mechanism of action for these peptides. finally, only the mature peptide was able to induce il-8 production in porcine macrophages, but some shorter peptides also had an effect on tnf-alpha production showing differential regulation of cytokine induction by pr-39 derived peptides. none of  the active peptides showed high cytotoxicity highlighting the potential of these  peptides for use as an alternative to antibiotics.

TI  == amikacin-fosfomycin at a five-to-two ratio: characterization of mutation rates in microbial strains causing ventilator-associated pneumonia and interactions with commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == the amikacin-fosfomycin inhalation system (afis), a combination of antibiotics administered with an in-line nebulizer delivery system, is being developed for adjunctive treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). the in vitro characterization of amikacin-fosfomycin (at a 5:2 ratio) described here included  determining resistance selection rates for pathogens that are representative of those commonly associated with vap (including multidrug-resistant strains) and evaluating interactions with antibiotics commonly used intravenously to treat vap. spontaneous resistance to amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) was not observed for most strains tested (n, 10/14). four strains had spontaneously resistant colonies (frequencies, 4.25 x 10(-8) to 3.47 x 10(-10)), for which amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) mics were 2- to 8-fold higher than those for the original strains. after 7  days of serial passage, resistance (>4-fold increase over the baseline mic) occurred in fewer strains (n, 4/14) passaged in the presence of amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) than with either amikacin (n, 7/14) or fosfomycin (n, 12/14) alone. interactions between amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) and 10 comparator antibiotics in checkerboard testing against 30 different gram-positive or gram-negative bacterial strains were synergistic (fractional inhibitory concentration [fic] index, </= 0.5) for 6.7% (n, 10/150) of combinations tested.  no antagonism was observed. synergy was confirmed by time-kill methodology for amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) plus cefepime (against escherichia coli), aztreonam (against pseudomonas aeruginosa), daptomycin (against enterococcus faecalis), and azithromycin (against staphylococcus aureus). amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) was bactericidal at 4-fold the mic for 7 strains tested. the reduced incidence of development of resistance to amikacin-fosfomycin (5:2) compared with that for amikacin or fosfomycin alone, and the lack of negative interactions with commonly used intravenous antibiotics, further supports the development of afis for the treatment of vap.

TI  == exploring 5-nitrofuran derivatives against nosocomial pathogens: synthesis, antimicrobial activity and chemometric analysis.
AB  == the burden of nosocomial or health care-associated infection (hcai) is increasing worldwide. according to the world health organization (who), it is several fold higher in low- and middle-income countries. considering the multidrug-resistant infections, the development of new and more effective drugs is crucial. herein, two series (i and ii) of 5-nitrofuran derivatives were designed, synthesized and  assayed against microorganisms, including gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and fungi. the pathogens screened was directly related to either the most currently relevant hcai, or to multidrug-resistant infection caused by mrsa/vrsa  strains, for instance. the sets i and ii were composed by substituted-[n'-(5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene]benzhydrazide and 3-acetyl-5-(substituted-phenyl)-2-(5-nitro-furan-2-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1,3,4-oxadiazo le compounds, respectively. the selection of the substituent groups was based upon physicochemical properties, such as hydrophobicity and electronic effect. the compounds have showed better activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis. the findings from s. aureus strain,  which was more susceptible, were used to investigate the intersamples and intervariables relationships by applying chemometric methods. it is noteworthy that the compound 4-butyl-[n'-(5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene]benzhydrazide has showed similar mic value to vancomycin, which is the reference drug for multidrug-resistant s. aureus infections. taken the findings together, the 5-nitrofuran derivatives might be indeed considered as promising hits to develop  novel antimicrobial drugs to fight against nosocomial infection.

TI  == in vitro efficacy of antibiotic beads in treating abdominal vascular graft infections.
AB  == objective: abdominal aortic vascular graft infection often involves several different organisms. antibiotic polymethyl methacrylate (pmma) beads may be effective in controlling infection after debridement, but bacterial species identification and antibiotic susceptibility are often not available at the time  of operation, generating a need for a broad-spectrum drug combination for empirical use. we sought to determine an effective antibiotic in pmma beads for use in abdominal vascular graft infection. methods: pmma beads were impregnated with combinations of antibiotics, consisting of daptomycin, tobramycin, and meropenem. antibiotics were selected on the basis of activity spectrum and heat stability. beads were placed on separate agar plates with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. antibiotic inhibition was recorded by use of a modified agar-based disk-diffusion method. results: daptomycin alone  was not active against k. pneumoniae (average = 0 mm). tobramycin alone was not active against vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, k. pneumoniae, or methicillin-resistant s. aureus. tobramycin and daptomycin in combination had moderate broad-spectrum activity with 8- to 14-mm mean inhibition halos. meropenem showed strong activity against all tested organisms with >15-mm mean inhibition halos. the addition of daptomycin to meropenem provided improved coverage of gram-positive organisms. the presence of tobramycin reduced the efficacy of meropenem. conclusions: antibiotic pmma beads containing 10% meropenem with 2.5% daptomycin had excellent in vitro activity against typical bacterial species associated with abdominal vascular graft infections. the addition of antibiotic beads may be a useful adjunct in managing such cases. further studies are required to determine efficacy in clinical practice.

TI  == graphene oxide as an anaerobic membrane scaffold for the enhancement of b. adolescentis proliferation and antagonistic effects against pathogens e. coli and s. aureus.
AB  == the impact of the gut microbiota on human health is widely perceived as the most  exciting advancement in biomedicine. the gut microbiota has been known to play a  crucial role in defining states of human health and diseases, and thus becomes a  potential new territory for drug targeting. herein, graphene oxide (go) interaction with five common human gut bacteria, b. adolescentis, l. acidophilus, e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus, was studied. it was shown that, in bacterial media, go sheets were able to form effective, anaerobic membrane scaffolds that enhanced the antagonistic activity of b. adolescentis against the pathogens e. coli ands. aureus. data obtained using bacterial growth measurements, colony counting and 16s rrna gene sequencing consistently indicated that go sheets promoted proliferation of gut bacteria, particularly for b. adolescentis. scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy images, and membrane potential measurements showed that cell membranes maintained their integrity and  that no observable variations in cell morphology were induced after interaction with go sheets, indicating good biocompatibility of go. these results suggest the possibility of using go sheets as efficient drug carriers in therapeutic applications to treat diseases related to the gut microbiota.

TI  == toxicity of magnetic chitosan micro and nanoparticles as carriers for biologically active substances.
AB  == nanoparticles of inorganic magnetic core surrounded by layers of functional coatings are potential representatives of nanostructures for immobilization of bio-substances. magnetic nanoparticles (mnps) are often bound in aggregates due to a strong magnetic dipole, which has a lot of advantages, such as large surface area for binding biologically active substances. chitosan is a polysaccharide polymer that is non-toxic, hydrophilic, biocompatible and has hydroxy and amino groups in its structure. because of these chemical and biological properties it is a desirable bio-product for immobilization of enzymes and for binding of other biologically active substances. magnetic micro and nanoparticles were synthesized with chitosan by three different methods; microemulsion process, suspension cross-linking technique and covalent binding of chitosan. toxic effect of the prepared magnetic particles was determined as well and was examined on five different bacterial cultures; escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and klebsiella pneumoniae. at concentrations of 10-30 mg of magnetic particles per 0.5 mcfarland standard solution of e. coli and per 400 cfu of s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, e. faecalis in k. pneumonia, no inhibition on the chosen bacterial cultures was detected.

TI  == aureobasidium pullulans as a source of liamocins (heavy oils) with anticancer activity.
AB  == liamocins are structurally unique, heavier-than-water "oils" produced by certain  strains of aureobasidium pullulans. the aim of the current study is to identify new sources of liamocins and evaluate their potential as anticancer agents. nine  strains of a. pullulans from phylogenetic clades 8, 9, and 11 were examined for the first time for production of liamocins. strains in these clades have only been isolated from tropical environments, and all strains tested here were from various locations in thailand. strains rsu 9, rsu 21, and rsu 29, all from clade  11, produced from 7.0 to 8.6 g liamocins/l from medium containing 5 % sucrose. these are the highest yields of liamocins that we have found thus far. these strains also produced from 9.4 to 17 g pullulan/l. the structural identity of liamocins was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry; differential spectra were obtained in which the dominant ion was either at about m/z 805.5 or m/z 949.6, consistent with the structure of liamocins. liamocins from a. pullulans strains rsu 9 and rsu 21 inhibited two human breast cancer cell lines and a human cervical cancer cell line (ic50 values of 32.2 +/- 1.4 to 63.1 +/- 2.4 mug liamocins/ml) but were not toxic to a normal  cell line. liamocins weakly inhibited a strain of enterococcus faecalis, but did  not inhibit strains of lactobacillus fermentum, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. thus, a. pullulans phylogenetic clade 11 is a promising source of liamocins, and these compounds merit further examination as potential anticancer agents.

AB  == antibiotic-loaded acrylic bone cement has been frequently used as an infection prophylaxis or antibiotic-loaded spacer in infected arthroplasty. in addition, daptomycin has been used recently against broad spectrum gram-positive organisms. the goal of this in vitro study is to investigate the bacteriacidal and mechanical properties of daptomycin-incorporated polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) bone cement and evaluate its feasibility for clinical use. daptomycin (0.5, 1, or 2 g) was premixed with 40 g of pmma bone cement powder before curing. the mechanical properties of the daptomycin-loaded acrylic bone cement (dlabc) were estimated following standard guidance, and the release profile and kinetics of daptomycin from pmma were analyzed. the antimicrobial efficacy of dlabc was determined with a zone of inhibition (zoi) assay against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermis, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium, respectively. the results showed that the compressive strength, of pmma bone cement, which was higher than 100 mpa in all groups, was sufficient according to  iso 5833 after incorporation of daptomycin. the encapsulated daptomycin was released for 2 weeks with a 9.59 +/- 0.85%, 15.25 +/- 0.69%, and 20.64 +/- 20.33% released percentage on the first day in the low, mid, and high groups, respectively. according to the calculated release kinetics, incorporated daptomycin should be 3.3 times the original dose to double its release. although  all recipes of dlabc had a microbial inhibitory effect, the effect with a higher  encapsulated amount of daptomycin was more significant. therefore, we believe that daptomycin can be locally delivered from pmma bone cement at the surgical site as a prophylactic or treatment for osteomyelitis against gram-positive organisms with intact cement function.

TI  == spiromastixones a-o, antibacterial chlorodepsidones from a deep-sea-derived spiromastix sp. fungus.
AB  == fifteen new depsidone-based analogues named spiromastixones a-o (1-15) were isolated from the fermentation broth of a deep-sea spiromastix sp. fungus. their  structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive nmr and mass spectroscopic analysis in association with chemical conversion. spiromastixones a-o are classified into two subtypes based on the orientation of ring c relative to ring  a, while the n-propyl substituents on rings a and c are rarely seen in natural products. most analogues are substituted by various numbers of chlorine atoms. all compounds exhibited significant inhibition against gram-positive bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, bacillus thuringiensis, and bacillus subtilis with mic values ranging from 0.125 to 8.0 mug/ml. in addition, compounds 6-10 displayed potent inhibitory effects against methicillin-resistant bacterial strains of s. aureus (mrsa) and s. epidermidis (mrse), while 10 also inhibited the growth of the vancomycin-resistant bacteria enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium (vre). the structure-activity relationships are discussed.

TI  == a comparison between antibacterial activity of propolis and aloe vera on enterococcus faecalis (an in vitro study).
AB  == removing the bacteria, including enterococcus faecalis, from the root canal is one of the important aims in endodontic treatment.we aimed to compare the antibacterial activity of chlorhexidine with two natural drugs. the antibacterial activities of three different propolis extracts (alcohol concentrations: 0, 15, 40%) and aloe vera gel on e. faecalis were compared using three methods: disk diffusion, microdilution and direct contact test. in addition to the above bacterium, the aloe vera gel effect on staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans was evaluated. disk diffusion test revealed that propolis ethanolic extracts (the alcohol concentration of 15 and 40%) and aloe vera gel have antibacterial activities but aqueous extract of propolis did not show any effect  in this test. the mics for propolis ethanolic extracts, aloe vera gel and aqueous extract of propolis (0% alcohol) were 313 microg/ml, 750 microg/ml, 2250 microg/ml, and >/= 500 microg/ml respectively, much higher than the chlorhexidine one. in direct contact test, contrary to aloe vera, all three propolis extracts showed antibacterial effects on e. faecalis. the aloe vera gel also showed significant antibacterial effect on s.aureus and s.mutans. the hydroalcoholic extracts of propolis and aloe vera gel had antibacterial effects on e. faecalis,  however, propolis is more potent than aloe vera. the antibacterial effect of aloe vera on s. aureus and s. mutans is low (mic >/= 2250 microg/ml). appropriate concentrations of alcoholic extracts of propolis and some fractions of aloe vera  gel might be good choices for disinfecting the root canal in endodontic treatments.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of the marine alkaloids, clathrodin and oroidin, and their synthetic analogues.
AB  == marine organisms produce secondary metabolites that may be valuable for the development of novel drug leads as such and can also provide structural scaffolds for the design and synthesis of novel bioactive compounds. the marine alkaloids,  clathrodin and oroidin, which were originally isolated from sponges of the genus, agelas, were prepared and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against three bacterial strains (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli) and one fungal strain (candida albicans), and oroidin was found to possess promising gram-positive antibacterial activity. using oroidin as a scaffold, 34 new analogues were designed, prepared and screened for their antimicrobial properties. of these compounds, 12 exhibited >80% inhibition of the growth of at least one microorganism at a concentration of 50 microm. the most active derivative was found to be 4-phenyl-2-aminoimidazole 6h, which exhibited mic(9)(0) (minimum inhibitory concentration) values of 12.5 microm against the gram-positive bacteria and 50 microm against e. coli. the selectivity index between s. aureus and mammalian cells, which is important to consider in the evaluation of a compound's potential as an antimicrobial lead, was found to be 2.9 for compound 6h.

AB  == curcumin is well known for its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. however, since systemic absorption and bioavailability of curcumin from gastrointestinal tract is considerably poor, synthetic curcuminoids are being developed as better alternatives. two curcumin derivatives: 3,5-bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidone (ef24) and ef24-dimer linked via diethylenetriaminepentacetic acid (ef2dtpa), were included in this study. we investigated the antibacterial activity of ef24 and ef2dtpa against gram-negative (escherichia coli) and gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. we also studied the effects of ef24 and ef2dtpa on uptake and localization of phrodo-labeled e. coli in the acidic compartments (phagolysosomes) of dendritic cells (dcs) under in vitro conditions. our results  demonstrate that treatment with ef24 and ef2dtpa directly suppresses the bacterial growth. however, these compounds do not affect the bacterial uptake or  localization in the dcs.

TI  == cerecidins, novel lantibiotics from bacillus cereus with potent antimicrobial activity.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides that are widely produced by gram-positive bacteria, including many species of the bacillus group. in the present study, one novel gene cluster coding lantibiotic cerecidins was unveiled in bacillus cereus strain as 1.1846 through genomic mining and pcr screening. the designated cer locus is different from that of conventional class ii lantibiotics in that it included seven tandem precursor cera genes, one modification gene (cerm), two processing genes (cert and cerp), one orphan regulator gene (cerr), and two immunity genes (cerf and cere). in addition, one unprecedented quorum sensing component, comqxpa, was inserted between cerm and cerr. the expression of cerecidins was not detected in this strain of b. cereus, which might be due to repressed transcription of cerm. we constitutively coexpressed cera genes and cerm in escherichia coli, and purified precerecidins were proteolytically processed with  the endoproteinase gluc and a truncated version of putative serine protease cerp. thus, two natural variants of cerecidins a1 and a7 were obtained which contained  two terminal nonoverlapping thioether rings rarely found in lantibiotics. both cerecidins a1 and a7 were active against a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria. cerecidin a7, especially its mutant dhb13a, showed remarkable efficacy  against multidrug-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mdrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), and even streptomyces.

TI  == vellozia flavicans mart. ex schult. hydroalcoholic extract inhibits the neuromuscular blockade induced by bothrops jararacussu venom.
AB  == background: snakebite is a significant public health issue in tropical countries. in brazil, some of the most common snake envenomations are from bothrops. bothrops bites trigger local and systemic effects including edema, pain, erythema, cyanosis, infections, and necrosis. vellozia flavicans is a plant from  the brazilian "cerrado" (savanna) that is popularly used as an anti-inflammatory  medicine. since inflammation develops quickly after bothrops bites, which can lead to infection, the aim of the present study was to observe possible anti-snake venom and antimicrobial activities of v. flavicans (vf). methods: the  chromatographic profile of the main constituents from the vf leaf hydroalcoholic  extract was obtained by thin-layer chromatography (tlc). the anti-snake venom activity was measured by vf's ability to neutralize the in vitro neuromuscular blockade caused by bothrops jararacussu venom (bjssu) in a mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm model (pnd). after a 20 min incubation, preparations of pnd were  added to tyrode's solution (control); vf (0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/ml); 40 mug/ml bjssu; pre-incubation for 30 min with bjssu and 1 mg/ml vf; and a bjssu pretreated preparation (for 10 min) followed by 1 mg/ml vf. myographic recording  was performed, and the contractile responses were recorded. the antimicrobial activity (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] and minimum bactericidal concentration [mbc]) was obtained for staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecalis, using gentamicin and vancomycin as positive controls. results: tlc analysis yielded several compounds  from vf, such as flavonoids (quercetin) and phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid). bjssu completely blocked the contractile responses of pnd preparations, while vf  preserved 97% (+/-10%) of the contractile responses when incubated with bjssu. in the pnd pretreated with bjssu, vf was able to inhibit the neuromuscular blockade  progress. mic and mbc of vf ranged from 2.5 to 5.0 mg/ml for p. aeruginosa and s. aureus strains, while no antimicrobial activity was observed for e. coli and e. faecalis. conclusions: the hydroalcoholic extract from vf leaves was able to neutralize and decrease the in vitro neuromuscular blockade caused by bjssu. however, it did not show significant antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria.

TI  == [investigation of antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of some preservatives used in drugs, cosmetics and food products].
AB  == preservatives are added to food, drugs and other pharmaceutical products to avoid microbial contamination. for antimicrobial activity testing and preservative efficacy testing, vegetative forms of the standard test organisms are used. however, microbial biofilm formation may occur on living tissues, medical implants, industrial or drinking water pipes, natural aquatic systems, glass and  plastic surfaces. in our study, it was aimed to determine the antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of some preservatives used in drug, cosmetics and food products and to compare the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (mbic) of microbial biofilm formed on glass surfaces which are commonly used in those areas and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of the planktonic forms. in the study pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, salmonella thyphimurium sl1344, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, staphylococcus epidermidis nctc 11047, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were used as the standard strains; sodium nitrate, methylparaben, prophylparaben, potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate as the preservatives; ampicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, amphotericin b and itraconazole as the antimicrobial agents. mic values were determined through the guidelines of clsi m100-s18 and m27-a3 protocols. biotimer method was used to determine the mbic values. the value of "colony forming unit (cfu)/glass beads" was calculated using the graphics drawn by plotting the time of color change for phenol red or resazurin against log10cfu. all experiments were done with four media at different ph values namely ph: 7, ph: 6.5, ph: 6 and ph: 5.5. according to the results of tests on planktonic forms of the microorganisms, sodium benzoate was determined to be the most effective preservative against all the microorganisms tested except s.aureus and e.faecalis. the most effective preservative against s.aureus  and e.faecalis was prophylparaben. prophylparaben was also effective against s.epidermidis. however, in our study it was determined that preservatives were not effective against biofilm forms even if the inoculum was lower, equal to or higher than the inocula of the planktonic forms. the data obtained from this study indicated that preservatives used to prevent microbial contamination in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food products, are not effective against biofilm forms of the microorganisms. this study is thought to be a guide for further studies to be held in the investigation of antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects  of preservatives used in drugs, cosmetics and food industry.

TI  == acanthamoeba and bacteria produce antimicrobials to target their counterpart.
AB  == background: in the microbial ecosystem, microbes compete for space and nutrients. consequently, some have developed the ability to kill or inhibit the growth of other competing microbes by producing antimicrobial substances. as the 'producer' species are generally immune to these substances, their compounds act on the competing microbial species and give the producer more space and access to nutrients for growth. many currently used antibiotics were developed by exploiting this potential of certain microbes. findings: here, the free-living amoeba, acanthamoeba castellanii, was investigated for its antibacterial activity against representative gram positive and gram negative bacteria, while bacterial  isolates were tested for their anti-amoebic properties. conditioned medium from a. castellanii showed remarkable bactericidal properties against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) exhibiting almost 100% kill rate, but had limited effect against acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre). similarly, the conditioned  medium of e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., exhibited potent anti-acanthamoebic effects in a concentration-dependent manner. conditioned media of acanthamoeba, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp. showed no cytotoxicity in vitro when tested against human brain microvascular endothelial cells. active molecule/s in aforementioned amoebic and two bacterial conditioned media were 5 - 10 kda, and <5 kda respectively. conclusions: a. castellanii conditioned medium showed potent bactericidal properties against mrsa. the active molecule(s) are heat- and pronase-resistant, and in the 5 to 10 kda molecular mass range. contrary to this, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., conditioned medium showed anti-amoebic effects that are <5 kda in molecular mass, suggestive of active metabolites.

TI  == effect of proton pump inhibitors on in vitro activity of tigecycline against several common clinical pathogens.

AB  == to date there are no clear criteria to determine whether a microbe is susceptible to biocides or not. as a starting point for distinguishing between wild-type and  resistant organisms, we set out to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) distributions for four common  biocides; triclosan, benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite for 3319 clinical isolates, with a particular focus on staphylococcus aureus (n = 1635) and salmonella spp. (n = 901) but also including escherichia coli (n = 368), candida albicans (n = 200), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 60), enterobacter spp. (n = 54), enterococcus faecium (n = 53), and enterococcus faecalis (n = 56). from these data epidemiological cut-off values (ecoffs) are proposed. as would be expected, mbcs were higher than mics for all biocides. in most cases both values  followed a normal distribution. bimodal distributions, indicating the existence of biocide resistant subpopulations were observed for enterobacter chlorhexidine  susceptibility (both mics and mbcs) and the susceptibility to triclosan of enterobacter (mbc), e. coli (mbc and mic) and s. aureus (mbc and mic). there is a concern on the potential selection of antibiotic resistance by biocides. our results indicate however that resistance to biocides and, hence any potential association with antibiotic resistance, is uncommon in natural populations of clinically relevant microorganisms.

TI  == in vitro activity of rifaximin against isolates from patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  == rifaximin, a non-absorbable rifamycin derivative, has published clinical efficacy in the alleviation of symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (sibo) is associated with the pathogenesis  of ibs. this study describes for the first time the antimicrobial effect of rifaximin against sibo micro-organisms from humans. fluid was aspirated from the  third part of the duodenum from 567 consecutive patients; quantitative cultures diagnosed sibo in 117 patients (20.6%). a total of 170 aerobic micro-organisms were isolated and the in vitro efficacy of rifaximin was studied by (i) minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing by a microdilution technique and (ii) time-kill assays using bile to simulate the small intestinal environment. at a breakpoint of 32 mug/ml, rifaximin inhibited in vitro 85.4% of escherichia coli,  43.6% of klebsiella spp., 34.8% of enterobacter spp., 54.5% of other enterobacteriaceae spp., 82.6% of non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negative spp., 100% of enterococcus faecalis, 100% of enterococcus faecium and 100% of staphylococcus aureus. for the time-kill assays, 11 e. coli, 15 non-e. coli gram-negative enterobacteria and three e. faecalis isolates were studied. rifaximin produced a  >3 log10 decrease in the starting inoculum against most of the tested isolates at 500 mug/ml after 24h of growth. the results indicate that rifaximin has a potent  effect on specific small bowel flora associated with sibo. this conclusion should be regarded in light of the considerable time-kill effect at concentrations lower than those achieved in the bowel lumen after administration of conventional doses in humans.

TI  == detection, partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 isolated from freshwater fish: bacteriocin from lb. brevis fptlb3.
AB  == lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 was isolated from freshwater fish, capable of producing bacteriocin that had broad spectrum of inhibition (3200 au/ml) against  escherichia coli mtcc 1563, enterococcus faecalis mtcc 2729, lactobacillus casei  mtcc 1423, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923. the antimicrobial activity of crude supernatant fluid was stable after heating at 121 degrees c for 60 min and declined thereafter. stability of antimicrobial activity was observed at ph range of 2.0 to 8.0. its active principle was proteinaceous in nature since the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not by other non-proteolytic enzymes. mitomycin c and uv light did not affect the activity of the bacteriocin, while chloroform extraction completely destroyed their activity. exposure to surfactant resulted in an increase in titre, except nonidet p-40, which led to total loss of activity. no bacteriocin adsorption was detected at ph 1 to 2, whereas 100% bacteriocin adsorption was found at ph 6.5. based on tricine sds-page the estimated molecular mass of bacteriocin was 54 kda. no plasmid was found to present in the isolate.

TI  == restriction of the conformational dynamics of the cyclic acyldepsipeptide antibiotics improves their antibacterial activity.
AB  == the cyclic acyldepsipeptide (adep) antibiotics are a new class of antibacterial agents that kill bacteria via a mechanism that is distinct from all clinically used drugs. these molecules bind and dysregulate the activity of the clpp peptidase. the potential of these antibiotics as antibacterial drugs has been enhanced by the elimination of pharmacological liabilities through medicinal chemistry efforts. here, we demonstrate that the adep conformation observed in the adep-clpp crystal structure is fortified by transannular hydrogen bonding and can be further stabilized by judicious replacement of constituent amino acids within the peptidolactone core structure with more conformationally constrained counterparts. evidence supporting constraint of the molecule into the bioactive conformer was obtained by measurements of deuterium-exchange kinetics of hydrogens that were proposed to be engaged in transannular hydrogen bonds. we show that the rigidified adep analogs bind and activate clpp at lower concentrations in vitro. remarkably, these compounds have up to 1200-fold enhanced antibacterial activity when compared to those with the peptidolactone core structure common to two adep natural products. this study compellingly demonstrates how rational modulation of conformational dynamics may be used to improve the bioactivities of natural products.

TI  == human pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and viruses in drosophila: disease modeling, lessons, and shortcomings.
AB  == drosophila has been the invertebrate model organism of choice for the study of innate immune responses during the past few decades. many drosophila-microbe interaction studies have helped to define innate immunity pathways, and significant effort has been made lately to decipher mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis. here we catalog 68 bacterial, fungal, and viral species studied in  flies, 43 of which are relevant to human health. we discuss studies of human pathogens in flies revealing not only the elicitation and avoidance of immune response but also mechanisms of tolerance, host tissue homeostasis, regeneration, and predisposition to cancer. prominent among those is the emerging pattern of intestinal regeneration as a defense response induced by pathogenic and innocuous bacteria. immunopathology mechanisms and many microbial virulence factors have been elucidated, but their relevance to human health conventionally necessitates  validation in mammalian models of infection.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == arda proteins from different mobile genetic elements can bind to the ecoki type i dna methyltransferase of e. coli k12.
AB  == anti-restriction and anti-modification (anti-rm) is the ability to prevent cleavage by dna restriction-modification (rm) systems of foreign dna entering a new bacterial host. the evolutionary consequence of anti-rm is the enhanced dissemination of mobile genetic elements. homologues of arda anti-rm proteins are encoded by genes present in many mobile genetic elements such as conjugative plasmids and transposons within bacterial genomes. the arda proteins cause anti-rm by mimicking the dna structure bound by type i rm enzymes. we have investigated arda proteins from the genomes of enterococcus faecalis v583, staphylococcus aureus mu50 and bacteroides fragilis nctc 9343, and compared them  to the arda protein expressed by the conjugative transposon tn916. we find that despite having very different structural stability and secondary structure content, they can all bind to the ecoki methyltransferase, a core component of the ecoki type i rm system. this finding indicates that the less structured arda  proteins become fully folded upon binding. the ability of arda from diverse mobile elements to inhibit type i rm systems from other bacteria suggests that they are an advantage for transfer not only between closely-related bacteria but  also between more distantly related bacterial species.

TI  == pathways and roles of wall teichoic acid glycosylation in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the thick peptidoglycan layers of gram-positive bacteria are connected to polyanionic glycopolymers called wall teichoic acids (wta). pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, or enterococcus faecalis produce wta with diverse, usually strain-specific structure. extensive studies on s. aureus wta mutants revealed important functions of wta in cell division, growth,  morphogenesis, resistance to antimicrobials, and interaction with host or phages. while most of the s. aureus wta-biosynthetic genes have been identified it remained unclear for long how and why s. aureus glycosylates wta with alpha- or beta-linked n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac). only recently the discovery of two wta  glycosyltransferases, tarm and tars, yielded fundamental insights into the roles  of s. aureus wta glycosylation. mutants lacking wta glcnac are resistant towards  most of the s. aureus phages and, surprisingly, tars-mediated wta beta-o-glcnac modification is essential for beta-lactam resistance in methicillin-resistant s.  aureus. notably, s. aureus wta glcnac residues are major antigens and activate the complement system contributing to opsonophagocytosis. wta glycosylation with  a variety of sugars and corresponding glycosyltransferases were also identified in other gram-positive bacteria, which paves the way for detailed investigations  on the diverse roles of wta modification with sugar residues.

TI  == a rare case of quadruple valve infective endocarditis of normal native valves - the advantage of tee.
AB  == quadruple valve infective endocarditis of apparently normal native valves is a relatively uncommon condition, reported particularly in the setting of intravenous drug use, structural heart disease and immunocompromised state, but its occurrence outside these settings is rare. multiple valve endocarditis is caused by staphylococcus aureus in the majority of cases. although enterococcus faecalis is a common cause of bacterial infective endocarditis overall, it is rarely reported to cause multiple valve involvement. the present case is one such rare report of a patient who had quadruple valve endocarditis of normal native valves, caused by e. faecalis. compared to single valve endocarditis, multiple valve disease is associated more frequently with heart failure, perivalvular complications and need for heart surgery; hence, early recognition of the extent  of disease and number of valves involved is crucial, as this in turn influences the management, risk of complications and outcomes. transthoracic echocardiography is a widely used first-line tool in the imaging of infective endocarditis, but transesophageal echocardiography, which is more sensitive, should be used more frequently to assess the extent of involvement. extensive valvular involvement alone does not preclude medical management, and surgical management should be considered only in those who do not respond to antimicrobials or in the case of hemodynamic compromise or mechanical complications.

TI  == effects of microgravity on the virulence of listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus  faecalis, candida albicans, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == to evaluate effects of microgravity on virulence, we studied the ability of four  common clinical pathogens--listeria monocytogenes, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, and candida albicans--to kill wild type caenorhabditis elegans (c. elegans) nematodes at the larval and adult stages. simultaneous studies were performed utilizing spaceflight, clinorotation in a 2-d clinorotation device, and static ground controls. the feeding rate of worms for killed e. coli was unaffected by spaceflight or clinorotation. nematodes, microbes, and growth media were separated until exposed to true or modeled microgravity, then mixed and grown for 48 h. experiments were  terminated by paraformaldehyde fixation, and optical density measurements were used to assay residual microorganisms. spaceflight was associated with reduced virulence for listeria, enterococcus, mrsa, and candida for both larval and adult c. elegans. these are the first data acquired with a direct in vivo assay system  in space to demonstrate virulence. clinorotation reproduced the effects of spaceflight in some, but not all, virulence assays: candida and enterococcus were less virulent for larval worms but not adult worms, whereas virulence of mrsa and listeria were unaffected by clinorotation in tests with both adult and larval worms. we conclude that four common clinical microorganisms are all less virulent in space.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == lipoteichoic acid of streptococcus mutans interacts with toll-like receptor 2 through the lipid moiety for induction of inflammatory mediators in murine macrophages.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is a pathogenic gram-positive bacterium that is closely associated with dental caries and subsequent pulpal inflammation. although lipoteichoic acid (lta) is considered a major virulence factor of gram-positive bacteria, little is known about the innate immunity to s. mutans lta. in this study, we purified lta from s. mutans (sm.lta) through n-butanol extraction, hydrophobic interaction column chromatography, and ion-exchange column chromatography to investigate its immunological properties using murine macrophages. the sm.lta preparation had no detectable contamination with endotoxins, proteins, or nucleic acids. upon exposure to sm.lta, the murine macrophage cell-line raw 264.7 cells produced tnf-alpha and nitric oxide (no) in  a dose-dependent manner. sm.lta preferentially bound to and activated cho/cd14/tlr2 cells rather than cho/cd14/tlr4 cells, which are stable transfectants expressing cd14 and tlr2 or cd14 and tlr4, respectively. sm.lta could not induce tnf-alpha or no production in macrophages derived from tlr2-deficient mice whereas it dose-dependently induced those inflammatory mediators in wild-type macrophages. tlr2-dependent induction of no by sm.lta was  also confirmed in raw 264.7 cells using specific antibodies blocking tlr2. furthermore, sm.lta deacylated by alkaline hydrolysis neither stimulated tlr2 nor induced tnf-alpha or no production, suggesting that sm.lta lipid moieties are crucial for the immuno-stimulatory activity of sm.lta. unlike staphylococcus aureus lta, which has potent immuno-stimulating activity, sm.lta showed a modest  induction of no production comparable to ltas of other oral bacteria enterococcus faecalis and lactobacillus plantarum. in conclusion, our results suggest that the sm.lta interacts with tlr2 through the lipid moiety for the induction of inflammatory mediators in macrophages.

TI  == prevalence of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase genes aph(3')-iiia and aph(3')-iia in escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and staphylococcus aureus isolates in austria.
AB  == the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase aph(3')-iia primarily inactivates kanamycin and neomycin, whilst aph(3')-iiia also inactivates amikacin. the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of both resistance genes in major human pathogens to obtain their baseline prevalence in the gene pool of these bacterial populations in austria. in total, 10 541 escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and staphylococcus aureus isolates were collected representatively without selection bias between 2008 and 2011. isolates were analysed by aph(3')-iiia/nptiii- and aph(3')-iia/nptii-specific taqman real-time pcr. for positive strains, mics using etests were performed and resistance gene sequences  were determined. the overall prevalence of aph(3')-iiia/nptiii was 1.62 % (95 % confidence interval: 1.38-1.88 %). in escherichia coli, enterococci, staphylococcus aureus, p. aeruginosa and salmonella spp., the aph(3')-iiia/nptiii prevalence was 0.47 % (0-1.47 %), 37.53 % (32.84-42.40 %), 2.90 % (1.51-5.02 %),  0 % (0-0.32 %) and 0 % (0-0.037 %), respectively. eleven of a total of 169 carriers showed single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the resistance allele. the overall prevalence of aph(3')-iia/nptii was 0.0096 % (0-0.046 %). escherichia coli (0-0.70 %), enterococci (0-0.75 %), staphylococcus aureus (0-0.73 %) and p.  aeruginosa (0-0.32 %) did not carry aph(3')-iia. a single salmonella isolate was  positive, resulting in an aph(3')-iia prevalence of 0.013 % (0-0.058 %). aph(3')-iiia/nptiii carriers were moderately prevalent in the strains tested except for in enterococci, which appeared to be an important reservoir for aph(3')-iiia. aph(3')-iia/nptii genes were detected at clinically irrelevant frequencies and played no significant role in the aminoglycoside resistance gene  pool during the observation period.

TI  == inducing secondary metabolite production by the endophytic fungus fusarium tricinctum through coculture with bacillus subtilis.
AB  == coculturing the fungal endophyte fusarium tricinctum with the bacterium bacillus  subtilis 168 trpc2 on solid rice medium resulted in an up to 78-fold increase in  the accumulation in constitutively present secondary metabolites that included lateropyrone (5), cyclic depsipeptides of the enniatin type (6-8), and the lipopeptide fusaristatin a (9). in addition, four compounds (1-4) including (-)-citreoisocoumarin (2) as well as three new natural products (1, 3, and 4) were not present in discrete fungal and bacterial controls and only detected in the cocultures. the new compounds were identified as macrocarpon c (1), 2-(carboxymethylamino)benzoic acid (3), and (-)-citreoisocoumarinol (4) by analysis of the 1d and 2d nmr and hrms data. enniatins b1 (7) and a1 (8), whose production was particularly enhanced, inhibited the growth of the cocultivated b. subtilis strain with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 16 and 8 mug/ml, respectively, and were also active against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis with mic values in the range 2-8 mug/ml. in addition, lateropyrone (5), which was constitutively present in f. tricinctum, displayed good antibacterial activity against b. subtilis, s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, and e. faecalis, with mic values ranging from 2 to 8 mug/ml. all active compounds were equally effective against a multiresistant clinical isolate of s. aureus and a susceptible reference strain of the same species.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the minimum bactericidal concentrations of different root-end filling materials.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of root-end filling materials proroot mta, mta angelus and irm. materials and methods: macrodilution broth method was used. microorganisms used were: staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212) and streptococcus mutans. serial two-fold dilutions of root-end filling samples were prepared in macrodilution tubes with concentrations ranging from 1/2 to 1/512. the samples dilutions were incubated for 24 hours. after incubation, 0.1 ml of diluted culture was inoculated onto the surface of supplemented sheep blood agar (merck, germany) and all plates were incubated at 37 degrees c in aerobic condition for 24 hours. the mbc was defined as the lowest concentration of root-end filling samples where no growth was recorded. results: mbc of both mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) products against s. aureus were recorded as 15.62 mg/ml and for irm 31.25 mg/ml mbc for both mta groups against e. faecalis were recorded as 31.25 mg/ml and for irm 62.5 mg/ml. mbc of all root-end filling  samples against s. mutans were recorded as 62.5 mg/ml. conclusion: all tested root-end filling materials showed acceptable mbc against s. aureus and e. faecalis. clinical significance: all tested materials can be used safely for filling of a root-end cavity.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of mineral trioxide aggregate with and without silver nanoparticles.
AB  == introduction: most current root-end filling materials do not provide a perfect seal. thus, a microscopic space is likely to exist in the interface between walls of the root-end cavity and filling material, which allows microorganisms and their products to penetrate. in addition to good sealing ability and biocompatibility, root-end filling materials should ideally have some antimicrobial activity. therefore, this in vitro study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of angelus white mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) and the mixture of mta with silver nanoparticles (1% weight; mta/sn). materials and methods: antimicrobial properties of mta and mta/sn were tested by agar diffusion technique against enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans. the microbial inhibition zones around the materials were measured by a caliper with 0.1-mm accuracy. student's t-test was used for comparison between the two groups in normal data distribution and man-whitney u test for non-normal distribution. results: student's t-test revealed that for e.  faecalis, c. albicans, and p. aeruginosa, microbial inhibition zone of mta/sn was significantly greater than that of mta (p = 0.000). mann-whitney u test indicated no significant difference between the effect of mta and mta/sn on s. aureus (p >  0.05). conclusion: based on the results of this study, adding silver nanoparticles to mta improved its antimicrobial efficacy.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of the ethanol extract, fractions and eight compounds isolated from eriosema robustum (fabaceae).
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity and  the cytotoxicity of the ethanol crude extract, fractions and isolated compounds from the twigs of eriosema robustum, a plant used for the treatment of coughs and skin diseases. methods: column chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques were  used to isolate and identify eight compounds, robusflavones a (1) and b (2), orostachyscerebroside a (3), stigmasterol (4), 1-o-heptatriacontanoyl glycerol (5), eicosanoic acid (6), 3-o-beta-d-glucopyranoside of sitosterol (7) and 6-prenylpinocembrin (8), from e. robustum. a two-fold serial microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against fungi and bacteria, and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity. results: fraction b had significant antimicrobial activity against aspergillus fumigatus and cryptoccocus neoformans (mic 0.08 mg/ml), whilst the crude extract and fraction a had moderate activity against a. fumigatus and candida albicans (mic 0.16 mg/ml). fraction a however had excellent activity against staphylococcus aureus (mic 0.02 mg/ml), enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli (mic 0.04 mg/ml). the crude extract had significant activity against s. aureus, e. faecalis and e. coli. fraction b had good activity against e. faecalis and e. coli (mic 0.08 mg/ml). all the isolated compounds had a relatively weak antimicrobial activity. an mic of 65 mug/ml was obtained with robusflavones a (1) and b (2) against c. albicans and a. fumigatus, orostachyscerebroside a (3) against a. fumigatus, and robusflavone b (2) against c. neoformans. compound 8 had the best activity against bacteria (average mic 55 mug/ml). the 3 fractions and isolated compounds had lc50 values between 13.20 to > 100 mug/ml against vero cells yielding selectivity indices between 0.01 and 1.58. conclusion: the isolated compounds generally had a much lower activity than expected based on the activity of the fractions from which they were isolated. this may be the result of synergism between different compounds in the complex extracts or fractions. the results support the traditional use of e. robustum to treat infections. the crude extract had a good  activity and low preparation cost, and may be useful in topical applications to combat microbial infections.

TI  == bio-preservation of ground beef meat by enterococcus faecalis cect7121.
AB  == meat and particularly ground beef is frequently associated with food poisoning episodes and breeches in food safety. the main goal of this research was to evaluate the bactericide effect of the probiotic enterococcus faecalis cect7121,  against different pathogens as: escherichia coli o157:h7, staphylococcus aureus,  clostridium perfringens and listeria monocytogenes, inoculated in ground beef meat. three studies were performed to evaluate the inhibition of e. faecalis cect7121 on ground beef meat samples inoculated with pathogens: study i: samples  (100 g meat) were inoculated with pathogens (10(3) cfu/g)) and e. faecalis cect7121 (10(4) cfu/g) simultaneously. study ii: samples were inoculated with e.  faecalis cect7121 24 h before the pathogens. study iii: e. faecalis cect7121were  inoculated 24 h after pathogens. the viable counts were performed at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h post-inoculation. the simultaneous inoculation of e. faecalis cect7121 with e. coli o157:h7 strains resulted in the absence of viable counts of bacteria at 72 h post-treatment. however, when the probiotic was added 24 h before and 24  h after the pathogen e. coli o157:h7, viable cells were not detected at 24 h and  48 h post-treatment, respectively. consistently, neither s. aureus nor cl. perfringens viable bacteria were detected at 48 h in whole assays when inoculated with e. faecalis cect7121. the same trend than described before was obtained after applying the 3 models assayed for l. monocytogenes. the current assays demonstrated the bactericide activity of e. faecalis cect7121 strain on bacterial pathogens in ground beef meat.

TI  == the impact of inappropriate antibiotics on bacteremia patients in a community hospital in taiwan: an emphasis on the impact of referral information for cases from a hospital affiliated nursing home.
AB  == background: evidence for the impact of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy on bacteremia is mainly from studies in medical centers. we investigated the impact  of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy on bacteremia in a community hospital. in  particular, patients from the hospital's affiliated nursing home were sent to the hospital with adequate referral information. methods: we performed a retrospective study to collect data of patients with bacteremia in a community hospital in taiwan from 2005 to 2007. results: a total of 222 patients with blood stream infection were diagnosed, of whom 104 patients (46.8%) died. the rate of initial inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions was high (59%). multivariate analysis revealed that patients with initial inappropriate antibiotics, patients  with ventilator support and patients requiring icu care were the independent predictors for inhospital mortality. patients referred from the hospital-affiliated nursing home and patients with normal wbc counts had better survival outcome. more than 80% cases infected with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus faecalis received initial inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. with the longer delay to administer appropriate antibiotic, a trend of higher mortality rates was observed. conclusions: bacteremia patients from a hospital-affiliated nursing home had a better prognosis, which may have been due to the adequate referral information. clinicians should be aware of the commonly ignored drug resistant pathogens, and  efforts should be made to avoid delaying the administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TI  == the daf-16/foxo transcription factor functions as a regulator of epidermal innate immunity.
AB  == the caenorhabditis elegans daf-16 transcription factor is critical for diverse biological processes, particularly longevity and stress resistance. disruption of the daf-2 signaling cascade promotes daf-16 activation, and confers resistance to killing by pathogenic bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. however, daf-16 mutants exhibit similar sensitivity to these bacteria as wild-type animals, suggesting that daf-16 is not normally activated by these bacterial pathogens. in this report, we demonstrate that daf-16 can be directly activated by fungal infection and wounding in wild-type animals, which is independent of the daf-2 pathway. fungal infection and wounding initiate the galphaq signaling cascade, leading to ca(2+) release. ca(2+) mediates the activation of bli-3, a dual-oxidase, resulting in the production of reactive oxygen species (ros). ros then activate daf-16 through a ste20-like kinase-1/cst-1. our results indicate that daf-16 in the epidermis is required for survival after fungal infection and wounding. thus, the egl-30-ca(2+)-bli-3-cst-1-daf-16 signaling represents a previously unknown pathway to regulate epidermal damage response.

TI  == bi-directional-bi-dimensionality alignment of self-supporting mn3o4 nanorod and nanotube arrays with different bacteriostasis and magnetism.
AB  == self-supported mn3o4 patterns of aligned nanorods and nanotubes were synthesized  through a bi-directional-bi-dimensionality growth model by using sodium gluconate and urea as additives under mild hydrothermal conditions without the use of any substrates. in one direction, mn3o4 grows to form one-dimensional nanorods or nanotubes, while in the other direction mn3o4 grows into two-dimensional nanoplates to support the nanorods or nanotubes to align into arrays. these two kinds of new nanostructures, a nanotube pattern and a nanorod pattern, show similar and good bacteriostasis for gram positive bacteria, but for gram negative bacteria the nanotube pattern shows much better bacterial restraint than the nanorod pattern. magnetic studies show that the nanorod arrays display similar magnetic properties to the commercial mn3o4, while the nanotube arrays show different ferromagnetic behaviors with enhanced remnant magnetization and saturation magnetization (ms) at low temperature.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == isolation and partial characterization of bacteria (pseudoalteromonas sp.) with potential antibacterial activity from a marine costal environment from new caledonia.
AB  == marine bacteria are a rich source of bioactive metabolites. however, the microbial diversity of marine ecosystem still needs to be explored. the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize bacteria with antimicrobial activities from various marine coastal environment of new caledonia. we obtained 493 marine  isolates from various environments and samples of which 63 (12.8%) presented an antibacterial activity against a panel of reference pathogenic strains (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis). ten out of the most promising strains were cultured, fractionated and  screened for antibacterial activity. four of them (nc282, nc412, nc272 and nc120) showed at least an activity against reference and multidrug-resistant pathogenic  strains and were found to belong to the genus pseudoalteromonas, according to the 16s phylogenetic analysis. the nc282 strain does not belong to any described pseudoalteromonas species and might be of interest for further chemical and biological characterization. these findings suggest that the identified strains may contribute to the discovery for new sources of antimicrobial substances to develop new therapies to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. significance and impact of the study: with the constant increasing of bacterial resistance against known antibiotics in worldwide public health, it is now necessary to find new sources of antimicrobials. marine bacteria from new caledonia were isolated, tested for antibacterial activity and characterized to find new active molecules against multidrug-resistant bacteria. this study illustrates the diversity of the marine ecosystem with potent new bacteria species. also the potential of marine bacteria as a rich source of bioactive molecule, for example antibiotics, is highlighted.

AB  == daptomycin is a lipopeptide antimicrobial with in vitro bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria that was first approved for clinical use in 2004 in the united states. since this time, significant data have emerged regarding the use of daptomycin for the treatment of serious infections, such as bacteremia and endocarditis, caused by gram-positive pathogens. however, there are also increasing reports of daptomycin nonsusceptibility, in staphylococcus aureus and, in particular, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis. such nonsusceptibility is largely in the context of prolonged treatment courses and infections with high bacterial burdens, but it may occur in the absence of prior  daptomycin exposure. nonsusceptibility in both s. aureus and enterococcus is mediated by adaptations to cell wall homeostasis and membrane phospholipid metabolism. this review summarizes the data on daptomycin, including daptomycin's unique mode of action and spectrum of activity and mechanisms for nonsusceptibility in key pathogens, including s. aureus, e. faecium, and e. faecalis. the challenges faced by the clinical laboratory in obtaining accurate susceptibility results and reporting daptomycin mics are also discussed.

TI  == in vitro efficacy of various topical antimicrobial agents in different time periods from contamination to application against 6 multidrug-resistant bacterial strains isolated from burn patients.
AB  == aim: in vitro efficacy evaluation of eleven topical antimicrobials against multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria isolated from burn wounds of our patients. material and methods: growth of six mdr bacterial strains: pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 strains), staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli in burn-wound models was evaluated 24-h after application of the tested agents. four different wound models were created to investigate the role of time elapsed between inoculation of bacteria and application of the agents on their antimicrobial activity and efficacy. results:  the efficacy against all the 6 bacteria in freshly contaminated wounds was excellent in majority of the tested agents. the longer was the time interval between inoculation and application of the topical antimicrobial agents, the higher failure of the agents was observed. conclusions: topical antimicrobials play an important role in treatment of burn wounds, but they should be used according to their efficacy against bacterial strains present in patients' wounds. in cases where topical agents have been applied after 24 h, when formation of mature biofilm in the wound could be expected, it would probably not be possible to kill all the bacteria using topical antimicrobial therapy only.

TI  == high-dose daptomycin therapy for left-sided infective endocarditis: a prospective study from the international collaboration on endocarditis.
AB  == the use of daptomycin in gram-positive left-sided infective endocarditis (ie) has significantly increased. the purpose of this study was to assess the influence of high-dose daptomycin on the outcome of left-sided ie due to gram-positive pathogens. this was a prospective cohort study based on 1,112 cases from the international collaboration on endocarditis (ice)-plus database and the ice-daptomycin substudy database from 2008 to 2010. among patients with left-sided ie due to staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococcus faecalis, we compared those treated with daptomycin (cohort a) to those treated with standard-of-care (soc) antibiotics (cohort b). the primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. time to clearance of bacteremia, 6-month mortality, and adverse events (aes) ascribable to daptomycin were also assessed.  there were 29 and 149 patients included in cohort a and cohort b, respectively. baseline comorbidities did not differ between the two cohorts, except for a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes and previous episodes of ie among patients treated with daptomycin. the median daptomycin dose was 9.2 mg/kg of body weight/day. two-thirds of the patients treated with daptomycin had failed a  previous antibiotic regimen. in-hospital and 6-month mortalities were similar in  the two cohorts. in cohort a, median time to clearance of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) bacteremia was 1.0 day, irrespective of daptomycin dose, representing a significantly faster bacteremia clearance compared to soc (1.0 versus 5.0 days; p < 0.01). regimens with higher daptomycin doses were not associated with increased incidence of aes. in conclusion, higher-dose daptomycin may be an effective and safe alternative to soc in the treatment of left-sided ie due to common gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish (armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and clostridium perfringens. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method.  the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the itcs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative  anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a mbc of 1.25 mg/ml, against c. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against f. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. these results suggest that the itcs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.

TI  == production of microbial medium from defatted brebra (milletia ferruginea) seed flour to substitute commercial peptone agar.
AB  == objective: to investigate and optimize microbial media that substitute peptone agar using brebra seed defatted flour. methods: defatted process, inoculums preparation, evaluation of bacterial growth, preparation of cooked and hydrolyzed media and growth turbidity of tested bacteria were determined. results: two percent defatted flour was found to be suitable concentration for the growth of pathogenic bacteria: escherichia coli (atcc 25922) (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), salmonella (nctc 8385) and shigella flexneri (atcc 12022) (s. flexneri), while 3% defatted flour was suitable for staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923) (s. aureus). e. coli (93+/-1) and s. flexneri (524+/-1) colony count were significantly (p</=0.05) greater in defatted flour without supplement than in supplemented medium. e. coli [(3.72x10(9)+/-2) cfu/ml], s. aureus [(7.4x10(9)+/-2) cfu/ml], s. flexneri [(4.03x10(9)+/-2) cfu/ml] and salmonella [(2.37x10(9)+/-1) cfu/ml] in non-hydrolyzed sample were statistically  (p</=0.05) greater than hydrolyzed one and commercial peptone agar. colony count  of salmonella [(4.55x10(9)+/-3) cfu/ml], s. flexneri [(5.40x10(9)+/-3) cfu/ml] and lyesria moncytogenes (atcc 19116) [(5.4x10(9)+/-3) cfu/ml] on raw defatted flour agar was significantly (p</=0.05) greater than cooked defatted flour and commercial peptone agar. biomass of e. coli, s. aureus, salmonella and enterococcus faecalis in non-hydrolyzed defatted flour is highly increased over hydrolyzed defatted flour and commercial peptone broth. conclusions: the defatted flour agar was found to be better microbial media or comparable with peptone agar. the substances in it can serve as sources of carbon, nitrogen, vitamins and minerals that are essential to support the growth of microorganisms without any supplements. currently, all supplements of peptone agar are very expensive in the market.

AB  == ethanol extracts from six selected species from the cerrado of the central-western region of brazil, which are used in traditional medicine for the  treatment of infectious diseases and other medical conditions, namely erythroxylum suberosum st. hil. (erythroxylaceae), hyptis crenata pohl. ex benth. (lamiaceae), roupala brasiliensis klotz. (proteaceae), simarouba versicolor st. hil. (simaroubaceae), guazuma ulmifolia lam. (sterculiaceae) and protium heptaphyllum (aubl.) march. (burseraceae), as well as fractions resulting from partition of these crude extracts, were screened in vitro for their antifungal and antibacterial properties. the antimicrobial activities were assessed by the broth microdilution assay against six control fungal strains, candida albicans, c. glabrata, c. krusei, c. parapsilosis, c. tropicalis and cryptococcus neoformans, and five control gram-positive and negative bacterial strains, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. toxicity of the extracts and fractions against artemia salina was also evaluated in this work. all plants investigated showed antimicrobial properties against at least one microorganism and two species were also significantly toxic to brine shrimp larvae. the results tend to support the traditional use of these plants for the treatment of respiratory and  gastrointestinal disorders and/or skin diseases, opening the possibility of finding new antimicrobial agents from these natural sources. among the species investigated, hyptis crenata, erythroxylum suberosum and roupala brasiliensis were considered the most promising candidates for developing of future bioactivity-guided phytochemical investigations.

TI  == the antimicrobial screening of a barbadian medicinal plant with indications for use in the treatment of diabetic wound infections.
AB  == objective: diabetes mellitus is a chronic non-communicable disease with high prevalence in the north american and caribbean region. diabetic foot syndrome which is an associated complication can lead to the development of wounds and ulcers which can become infected. justicia secunda, a plant known locally in barbados as bloodroot used in folklore for wound healing, was selected to test its ability to aid diabetic wound healing by antimicrobial activity. it was therefore tested against the bacteria staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, and enterococcus feacalis (clincal strain) which are commonly found in diabetic wounds. methods: the plant was collected by  local users. methanol and acetone extracts of the plant were prepared with use of soxhlet extraction. the antimicrobial activity was assessed with the use of a modified kirby-baurer method. concentrations of 200 mg/ml, 100 mg/ml, 10 mg/ml, and 1 mg/ml of the extract were used, with a standard ciprofloxacin 5 microg positive control, and a 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) solution negative control. results: the j secunda methanol and acetone extracts with an extraction yield of  15.3% and 0.75%, respectively yielded no activity within the concentration range  against the three strains of bacteria tested. in comparison with the positive control, relative inhibition zone diameter (rizd) values of 0% resulted for both  the negative control and the extracts, with the positive control having a value of 100%. conclusion: the in vitro screen of the extracts prepared from j secunda, yielded no antimicrobial activity against the three strains of bacteria tested and therefore does not support the folklore claims by this mechanism of action.

TI  == risk factors for and epidemiology of community-onset vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis in southeast michigan.
AB  == background: given the known link between vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vref) and vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa), the recent increase in prevalence of vref in southeast michigan has raised concerns about the presence of a large "community" reservoir of vref. efforts to control its spread face some important challenges. methods: patients with clinical isolates of community-onset (co) vref (cases) were compared with matched uninfected controls (study 1) and patients with hospital-onset (ho) vref (study 2). here, co was defined as a hospital stay of </=2 days before vre isolation. results: independent predictors for the isolation of co-vref compared with uninfected controls were nonhome residence; chronic skin ulcers; previous invasive procedures/surgery; exposure to cephalosporin, penicillin, and/or vancomycin; immunosuppressive status; and the presence of indwelling devices. independent predictors for isolation of co-vref compared with ho-vref included no stay in an  intensive care unit in the previous 3 months and recent hospitalization. vref isolation from wounds and aminoglycoside exposure were inversely associated with  isolation of co-vref. conclusions: health care-related exposures and antimicrobial exposures are risk factors for the isolation of co-vref. regional infection control practices are imperative in controlling co-vref, in addition to the emergence and spread of vrsa.

TI  == correlations between income inequality and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study is to investigate if correlations exist between income inequality and antimicrobial resistance. this study's hypothesis is that income inequality at the national level is positively correlated with antimicrobial resistance within developed countries. data collection and analysis: income inequality data were obtained from the standardized world income inequality database. antimicrobial resistance data were obtained from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance network and outpatient antimicrobial consumption data, measured by defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day, from the european surveillance of antimicrobial consumption  group. spearman's correlation coefficient (r) defined strengths of correlations of: > 0.8 as strong, > 0.5 as moderate and > 0.2 as weak. confidence intervals and p values were defined for all r values. correlations were calculated for the  time period 2003-10, for 15 european countries. results: income inequality and antimicrobial resistance correlations which were moderate or strong, with 95% confidence intervals > 0, included the following. enterococcus faecalis resistance to aminopenicillins, vancomycin and high level gentamicin was moderately associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.54 for all three antimicrobials). escherichia coli resistance to aminoglycosides, aminopenicillins, third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones was moderately-strongly associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.7 for all four antimicrobials). klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones was moderately associated with income inequality (r= >/=0.5 for all three antimicrobials). staphylococcus aureus methicillin resistance and income inequality were strongly associated (r=0.87). conclusion: as income inequality increases in european countries so do  the rates of antimicrobial resistance for bacteria including e. faecalis, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus. further studies are needed to confirm these findings outside europe and investigate the processes that could causally link income inequality and antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanocluster-based affinity mass spectrometry for pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == rationale: bacterial infections can be difficult to treat and can lead to irreversible damage to patients if proper treatment is not provided in time. additionally, the emerging threat from antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains makes medical treatment even more difficult. thus, rapid identification of infected bacterial strains is essential to assist diagnostics and medical treatment. methods: lysozymes are glycoside hydrolases that can bind with peptidoglycans on bacterial cell walls. in this work, we demonstrated that lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanoclusters (lysozyme-auncs) with red photoluminescence can be used as affinity probes to concentrate pathogenic bacteria. after bacteria had been probed by the lysozyme-auncs in a sample solution, the lysozyme-aunc-bacteria conjugates were readily spun down at a low centrifugation speed. the red emission from the auncs on the conjugates could be  visualized with the naked eye under illumination of ultraviolet light. the bacteria in the conjugates can be identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (maldi-ms) combined with principal component analysis (pca). results: we demonstrated that pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre) can be readily concentrated by the lysozyme-auncs and distinguished by the results combining maldi-ms and pca. additionally, the possibility of using the current approach to  differentiate e. faecalis from vre was also demonstrated. the lowest detection concentration for e. coli using the current approach is ~10(6) cells/ml. conclusions: the results indicated that the lysozyme-auncs are effective affinity probes for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. by combining the results from maldi-ms and pca, different bacteria can be easily distinguished. the current approach can be potentially used to assist the identification of bacteria from biological fluids.

TI  == biological evaluation of hyperforin and its hydrogenated analogue on bacterial growth and biofilm production.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are organized communities of microorganisms, embedded in a self-produced matrix, growing on a biotic surface and resistant to many antimicrobial agents when associated with a medical device. these biofilms require the development of new strategies for the prevention and treatment of infectious disease, including the potential use of natural products. one interesting natural product example is hypericum, a plant genus that contains species known to have antimicrobial properties. the major constituent of hypericum perforatum is an unstable compound named hyperforin (1); for this reason it was not believed to play a significant role in the pharmacological effects. in this investigation a hydrogenated hyperforin analogue (2) was tested  on several atcc and clinical isolate strains, in their planktonic and biofilm form (staphylococcus aureus, mrsa, and enterococcus faecalis). compound 2 was effective against planktonic and biofilm cultures, probably due to higher stability, showing the percentage of cells killed in the range from 45% to 52%. these results are noteworthy from the point of view of future development of these polyprenylated phloroglucinols as potential antibiotics.

AB  == background: antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens is an emerging problem worldwide. to combat multidrug resistant organisms (mrdos) networks of care providers have been established in all states in germany. the hicare-network, a project to combat mrdos, founded by the federal ministry of education and research, has published data from 2010 of a voluntary, german-wide, multicenter point-prevalence survey in 2011 conducted in collaboration with the german society of hospital hygiene. the aim of the present survey was the re-evaluation  of the situation in 2012. method: the survey was conducted as a voluntary, anonymous, point-prevalence in may 2012 using routine data of microbiological diagnostics of the hospitals. as in the former survey of 2010 it was differentiated between primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals and only data from intensive care units, surgical and medical wards were collected. based  on the survey form used in 2010, an updated version was used including more pathogens and corrected issues observed in the former survey. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (total as well as separated in hospital-acquired (ha), community-acquired (ca) and lifestock-associated (la) mrsa), vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa/grsa), vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis resp. enterococcus faecium (vr-e. faecalis resp.  vr-e. faecium), extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-building (esbl) e. coli (esbl-ec) and klebsiella pneumoniae (esbl-kp), multiresistant acinetobacter spp.  (mab), multiresistant pseudomonas spp. (mrp), carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cre) as well as clostridium difficile (cd) infections and severe infections requiring icu-treatment were included in the survey along with  additional data on screening strategy, the equipment with infection control staff and possible confounders. results: out of 1,550 hospitals asked to participate, 62 returned data (4%). data from 56 hospitals including primary (26), secondary (20) and tertiary (10) care hospitals were analyzable (3.6%). the most frequently reported organisms were mrsa 1.53% [ci95: 1.32-1.75], followed by cdad 1.30% [ci95: 1.11-1.50], esbl-ec 0.97% [ci95: 0.80-1.14], and esbl-kp 0.27% [ci95: 0.18-0.36], regardless of the level of care. prevalence of mrdos depended on the  level of care and on the type of ward, as expected. overall prevalence was highest on intensive care wards, and prevalences were remarkably high on medical  wards compared to surgical wards. all tertiary care providers employed their own  infection control nurse, while only ~70% of the secondary and primary care hospitals did. surprisingly, in two of the ten participating tertiary care providers neither an internal nor an external infection control doctor was available. discussion: with more than 13,000 patients in 56 hospitals distributed all over germany, the survey included more than three times as many patients as the first survey and therefore not only adds valuable information about the epidemiology of emerging nosocomial pathogens, but also helps to raise awareness  of the problem of antibacterial resistance in germany. the prevalences reported seem to be comparable to the results of the former survey and of other surveys published. some hospitals reported to have no infection control personnel available at all. this statement is in line with another survey published in this issue.

AB  == assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. we evaluated the verigene gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp) in two pediatric hospitals. positive bact/alert pediatric fan blood cultures with gram-positive organisms were tested using the bc-gp in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. to test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles  were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 cfu  per milliliter. a total of 249 gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, and methicillin-resistant s. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%,  respectively. the bc-gp detected staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis  with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. the  bc-gp correctly identified 14/15 cases of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus  faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae. it misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus mitis/streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with streptococcus anginosus group as s. pneumoniae. the bc-gp detected a case of streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with streptococcus agalactiae. bc-gp's rapid accurate detection of staphylococcus spp., e. faecium, and e. faecalis and its ability to  ascertain meca, vana, and vanb status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining  to optimal antibiotic use. false-positive s. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the bc-gp.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of amazonian medicinal plants.
AB  == objectives: the aqueous extracts of currently utilized amazonian medicinal plants were assayed in vitro searching for antimicrobial activity against human and animal pathogenic microorganisms. methods: medium resuspended lyophilized aqueous extracts of different organs of amazonian medicinal plants were assayed by in vitro screening for antimicrobial activity. atcc and standardized microorganisms  obtained from oswaldo cruz foundation/brazil were individually and homogeneously  grown in agar plate, and holes previously perforated in the gel were filled with  diluted plant aqueous extracts. inhibition halos were evaluated and controlled by the use of the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. results: the amazonian medicinal plants, hymenelobium petraeum showed inhibitory activity over staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica serovar typhi, acinetobacter baumannii and candida albicans, while vatairea guianensis and symphonia globulifera presented inhibitory activity exclusively for staphylococcus aureus.  also, ptychopetalum olacoides and pentaclethra macroloba inhibited the growth of  klebsiella ozaenae and acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: the aqueous botanic extracts that showed activity against microroganisms of attc and osvaldo cruz strains had at least 40% of antimicrobial activity when compared to halo inhibition produced by the commercial antibiotic ciprofloxacin utilized as a control. of all plants extracts assayed, the hymenelobium petraeum had the best performance, sometimes exhibiting higher activity than ciprofloxacin. it is not well-defined by the physicians the exact indication of the majority of medicinal  plants in the amazon area in brazil. natives utilize the plants according to their symptoms, based on the traditional knowledge transmitted orally from generation to generation, among amerindians, afrodescendents and ethnic mixed populations. a significant number of amazonian medicinal plants are totally unknown related to their medicinal properties including mechanism of action and therapeutic effects, as very few information is reported in the scientific literature. a tiny amount of data is presented, as the preliminary antimicrobial  properties of the medicinal plants here accessed, under the urgent necessity of new antibiotics in the market and in face of the increased resistance of infectious microorganisms to antimicrobials.

TI  == a product of heme catabolism modulates bacterial function and survival.
AB  == bilirubin is the terminal metabolite in heme catabolism in mammals. after deposition into bile, bilirubin is released in large quantities into the mammalian gastrointestinal (gi) tract. we hypothesized that intestinal bilirubin  may modulate the function of enteric bacteria. to test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of bilirubin on two enteric pathogens; enterohemorrhagic  e. coli (ehec), a gram-negative that causes life-threatening intestinal infections, and e. faecalis, a gram-positive human commensal bacterium known to be an opportunistic pathogen with broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance. we demonstrate that bilirubin can protect ehec from exogenous and host-generated reactive oxygen species (ros) through the absorption of free radicals. in contrast, e. faecalis was highly susceptible to bilirubin, which causes significant membrane disruption and uncoupling of respiratory metabolism in this  bacterium. interestingly, similar results were observed for other gram-positive bacteria, including b. cereus and s. aureus. a model is proposed whereby bilirubin places distinct selective pressure on enteric bacteria, with gram-negative bacteria being protected from ros (positive outcome) and gram-positive bacteria being susceptible to membrane disruption (negative outcome). this work suggests bilirubin has differential but biologically relevant effects on bacteria and justifies additional efforts to determine the role of this neglected waste catabolite in disease processes, including animal models.

TI  == rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == this study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (utis). urine samples from patients with utis (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. the urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. bacterial species were identified by a combination of  bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the bact-ist microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. the most common seven species of bacteria in the study included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection"  method using capillary electrophoresis (ce). each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. the mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (cfu)/ml, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (r(2)=0.99). the effect of urine composition on ce results was also investigated. the results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (wbcs) and red blood cells (rbcs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. the results demonstrated that the bacteria in  urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using ce. the "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from utis.

AB  == the aim of this research work is to identify the presence of pathogens, bacteria  and protozoa, in different treated urban wastewaters and to relate biological pollution with the processes used in wastewater treatment plants. a study of the  possibilities for water reuse is carried out taking into account bacterial and parasite composition. the analysed bacteria and protozoa are: enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens  (spore), salmonella spp., legionella spp., helminths eggs, giardia, cryptosporidium spp. and free-living amoebae (fla). the selected municipal wastewater treatment plants (mwtps) are located in navarra (spain) and the main difference between them is the use of natural lagoons as tertiary treatment in some plants. the results concerning bacteriological identification showed contamination of mainly faecal origin, and the use of natural lagoons as tertiary treatment in some mwtps produced an important disinfection effect. moreover, pathogen parasites such as giardia and cryptosporidium were not detected in the samples studied although fla were identified in all cases.

TI  == interdigitated silver-polymer-based antibacterial surface system activated by oligodynamic iontophoresis - an empirical characterization study.
AB  == there is a pressing need to control the occurrences of nosocomial infections due  to their detrimental effects on patient well-being and the rising treatment costs. to prevent the contact transmission of such infections via health-critical surfaces, a prophylactic surface system that consists of an interdigitated array  of oppositely charged silver electrodes with polymer separations and utilizes oligodynamic iontophoresis has been recently developed. this paper presents a systematic study that empirically characterizes the effects of the surface system parameters on its antibacterial efficacy, and validates the system's effectiveness. in the first part of the study, a fractional factorial design of experiments (doe) was conducted to identify the statistically significant system  parameters. the data were used to develop a first-order response surface model to predict the system's antibacterial efficacy based on the input parameters. in the second part of the study, the effectiveness of the surface system was validated by evaluating it against four bacterial species responsible for several nosocomial infections - staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis - alongside non-antibacterial polymer (acrylic) control surfaces. the system demonstrated statistically significant efficacy against all four bacteria. the results indicate that given a constant total effective surface area, the system designed with micro-scale features (minimum feature width: 20 mum) and activated by 15 mua direct current will provide the most effective antibacterial prophylaxis.

TI  == czech ethanol-free propolis extract displays inhibitory activity against a broad  spectrum of bacterial and fungal pathogens.
AB  == propolis acts primarily as a biocide against invasive bacteria and fungi in the hive, suggesting its potential for industrial applications. in food application,  propolis is considered as a chemical preservative in meat products, extending shelf life of frozen meat and other food. the mechanism of action is still unclear due to the synergy of multiple compounds contained in propolis and due to parallel targeting of multiple pathways within each affected organism. here, we examined the antimicrobial properties of dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) czech propolis  extract. until recently, dmso was only rarely used in the propolis studies, although the other solvents tested (mostly ethanol) may significantly affect the  observed inhibitory effects, notwithstanding the antimicrobial effects of ethanol itself. here, we provide results of zone inhibition tests against aspergillus fumigatus, microsporum gypseum, microsporum canis, candida albicans, escherichia  coli, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis. although we determined inhibitory effects against all the microorganisms tested,  the dose-dependent response curves were not similar to each other. while inhibitory effects against c. albicans or s. aureus were strictly dose-dependent, responses of m. gypseum and e. faecalis displayed plateau across the broad range  of concentrations tested. interestingly, response of e. coli revealed the double-peak dose-dependent curve, and responses of m. canis and l. monocytogenes  decreased at the highest concentrations tested. suggested is evaluation of dmso propolis extracts in experimental treatment of human and veterinary infections, preferably in multitherapy with antibiotics.

TI  == direction of aminoacylated transfer rnas into antibiotic synthesis and peptidoglycan-mediated antibiotic resistance.
AB  == prokaryotic aminoacylated-transfer rnas often need to be efficiently segregated between translation and other cellular biosynthetic pathways. many clinically relevant bacteria, including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa direct some aminoacylated-trna species into peptidoglycan biosynthesis and/or membrane phospholipid modification. subsequent indirect peptidoglycan cross-linkage or change in membrane permeability is often a prerequisite for high-level antibiotic resistance. in streptomycetes, aminoacylated-trna species are used for antibiotic synthesis as well as antibiotic resistance. the direction of coding aminoacylated-trna molecules away from translation and into antibiotic resistance and synthesis pathways are discussed in this review.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == synthetic inhibitors of bacterial cell division targeting the gtp-binding site of ftsz.
AB  == cell division protein ftsz is the organizer of the cytokinetic z-ring in most bacteria and a target for new antibiotics. ftsz assembles with gtp into filaments that hydrolyze the nucleotide at the association interface between monomers and then disassemble. we have replaced ftsz's gtp with non-nucleotide synthetic inhibitors of bacterial division. we searched for these small molecules among compounds from the literature, from virtual screening (vs), and from our in-house synthetic library (ucm), employing a fluorescence anisotropy primary assay. from  these screens we have identified the polyhydroxy aromatic compound ucm05 and its  simplified analogue ucm44 that specifically bind to bacillus subtilis ftsz monomers with micromolar affinities and perturb normal assembly, as examined with light scattering, polymer sedimentation, and negative stain electron microscopy.  on the other hand, these ligands induce the cooperative assembly of nucleotide-devoid archaeal ftsz into distinct well-ordered polymers, different from gtp-induced filaments. these ftsz inhibitors impair localization of ftsz into the z-ring and inhibit bacterial cell division. the chlorinated analogue ucm53 inhibits the growth of clinical isolates of antibiotic-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. we suggest that these interfacial inhibitors recapitulate binding and some assembly-inducing effects of gtp but impair the correct structural dynamics of ftsz filaments and thus inhibit bacterial division, possibly by binding to a small fraction of the ftsz molecules in a bacterial cell, which opens a new approach to ftsz-based antibacterial drug  discovery.

TI  == lysins: the arrival of pathogen-directed anti-infectives.
AB  == lysins represent a novel class of anti-infectives derived from bacteriophage. lysins are bacterial cell-wall hydrolytic enzymes that selectively and rapidly kill (>/=3 log c.f.u. in 30 min) specific gram-positive bacteria providing a targeted therapeutic approach with minimal impact on unrelated commensal flora. the potential for bacterial resistance to lysins is considered low due to targeting of highly conserved peptidoglycan components. through cutting-edge genetic engineering, lysins can be assembled into large libraries of anti-infective agents tailored to any bacterium of interest including drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens such as meticillin- and vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. lysins can eliminate bacteria systemically and topically from mucosal surfaces and biofilms, as evidenced by experimental models of sepsis, endocarditis, pneumonia, meningitis, and nasopharyngeal, skin and vaginal decolonization. furthermore, lysins can act synergistically with antibiotics and, in the process, resensitize bacteria to non-susceptible antibiotics. clinical trials are being prepared to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of  lysins in humans.

AB  == objectives: antimicrobial drug resistance is a growing problem in europe and, even with differences in epidemiology, it is of great concern. the treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (csstis) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (ciais) is hindered further by pathogens that are resistant to methicillin, carbapenems, third-generation cephalosporins and glycopeptides. patients and methods: an analysis of the microbiological results from five european observational studies (july 2006 to october 2011) evaluating the efficacy of tigecycline (prescribed as monotherapy or in combination with other antibacterials) for the treatment of cssti and ciai is presented. results:  in total, 213 cssti and 623 ciai patients were included; 34.4% and 56.6%, respectively, were critically ill in intensive care units. at baseline, at least  one pathogen was isolated in 167 (78.4%) cssti and 464 (74.5%) ciai patients, and 32.9% and 49.1% of infections were polymicrobial. in cssti, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli (52.7% and 18.0%, respectively) were the most frequently isolated pathogens, whereas in ciai most infections were due to e. coli (41.8%),  enterococcus faecium (40.1%) and enterococcus faecalis (21.1%). clinical response was observed in >80% of patients with e. coli in both ciai and cssti. in cssti patients, the clinical response rate to s. aureus was 80.8%. for ciai, 77.4% of e. faecium and 79.5% of e. faecalis patients responded to treatment. conclusions: tigecycline when given alone or in combination with other antibacterials appeared to be efficacious against multiple pathogens, affirming its role in real-life clinical practice as a broad-spectrum antibacterial for the treatment of patients with cssti and ciai, including the critically ill, across europe.

TI  == quantitative detection of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa in human oral epithelial cells from subjects with periodontitis and periodontal health.
AB  == epithelial cells in oral cavities can be considered reservoirs for a variety of bacterial species. a polymicrobial intracellular flora associated with periodontal disease has been demonstrated in buccal cells. important aetiological agents of systemic and nosocomial infections have been detected in the microbiota of subgingival biofilm, especially in individuals with periodontal disease. however, non-oral pathogens internalized in oral epithelial cells and their relationship with periodontal status are poorly understood. the purpose of this study was to detect opportunistic species within buccal and gingival crevice epithelial cells collected from subjects with periodontitis or individuals with good periodontal health, and to associate their prevalence with periodontal clinical status. quantitative detection of total bacteria and staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis in oral epithelial cells was determined by quantitative real-time pcr using universal and species-specific primer sets. intracellular bacteria were visualized by confocal microscopy and fluorescence in situ hybridization. overall, 33% of cell samples from patients with periodontitis contained at least one opportunistic species, compared with 15% of samples from healthy individuals. e. faecalis was the most prevalent species found in oral epithelial cells (detected in 20.6% of patients with periodontitis, p = 0.03 versus healthy individuals) and was detected only in cells from patients with periodontitis. quantitative real-time pcr showed that high levels of p. aeruginosa and s. aureus were present in both the periodontitis and healthy groups. however, the proportion of these species was significantly higher in epithelial cells of subjects with periodontitis compared with healthy individuals (p = 0.016 for p. aeruginosa and p = 0.047 for s. aureus). although e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa were detected in 57% and 50% of patients, respectively, with probing depth and clinical attachment level >/=6 mm, no correlation was found with age, sex, bleeding on probing or the presence of supragingival biofilm. the prevalence of these pathogens in epithelial cells is correlated with the state of periodontal disease.

TI  == impact of chlorine dioxide gas sterilization on nosocomial organism viability in  a hospital room.
AB  == to evaluate the ability of clo2 to decontaminate pathogens known to cause healthcare-associated infections in a hospital room strains of acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium smegmatis, and  staphylococcus aureus were spot placed in duplicate pairs at 10 sites throughout  a hospital room and then exposed to clo2 gas. organisms were collected and evaluated for reduction in colony forming units following gas exposure. six sterilization cycles with varied gas concentrations, exposure limits, and relative humidity levels were conducted. reductions in viable organisms achieved  ranged from 7 to 10-log reductions. two sterilization cycles failed to produce complete inactivation of organisms placed in a bathroom with the door closed. reductions of organisms in the bathroom ranged from 6-log to 10-log reductions. gas leakage between hospital floors did not occur; however, some minor gas leakage from the door of hospital room was measured which was subsequently sealed to prevent further leakage. novel technologies for disinfection of hospital rooms require validation and safety testing in clinical environments. gaseous clo2 is effective for sterilizing environmental contamination in a hospital room. concentrations of clo2 up to 385 ppm were safely maintained in a hospital room with enhanced environmental controls.

TI  == human colonic mucus is a reservoir for antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == background and aims: to prevent bacterial adherence and translocation, the colonic mucosa is covered by a protecting mucus layer and the epithelium synthesizes antimicrobial peptides. the present qualitative study investigated the contents and interaction of these peptides in and with rectal mucus. methods: rectal mucus extracts were analyzed for antimicrobial activity and screened with  matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, dot blot and immunohistochemistry for antimicrobial peptides. in addition, binding of amps to mucins was investigated by western blot and enzyme-linked lectin assays.  results: in functional tests the mucus layer exhibited a strong antimicrobial activity. we detected 11 antimicrobial peptides in mucus extracts from healthy persons including the defensins hbd-1 and -3, the cathelicidin ll-37, ubiquitin,  lysozyme, histones, high mobility group nucleosome-binding domain-containing protein 2, ubiquicidin and other ribosomal proteins. amps were bound by mucins but this was demonstrated to be reversible and inhibition of antibacterial activity was limited. conclusion: these findings indicate that epithelial antimicrobial peptides are retained in the intestinal mucus layer without losing  their efficacy. thus, the mucus layer and its composition provide an attractive drug target to restore antimicrobial barrier function in intestinal diseases.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of lapachol and its thiosemicarbazone and semicarbazone derivatives.
AB  == lapachol was chemically modified to obtain its thiosemicarbazone and semicarbazone derivatives. these compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against several bacteria and fungi by the broth microdilution method. the thiosemicarbazone and semicarbazone derivatives of lapachol exhibited antimicrobial activity against the bacteria enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 0.05 and 0.10 micromol/ml, respectively. the thiosemicarbazone and semicarbazone derivatives were also active against the pathogenic yeast cryptococcus gattii (mics of 0.10 and 0.20 micromol/ml, respectively). in addition, the lapachol thiosemicarbazone derivative was active against 11 clinical isolates of paracoccidioides brasiliensis, with mics ranging from 0.01-0.10 micromol/ml. the  lapachol-derived thiosemicarbazone was not cytotoxic to normal cells at the concentrations that were active against fungi and bacteria. we synthesised, for the first time, thiosemicarbazone and semicarbazone derivatives of lapachol. the  mics for the lapachol-derived thiosemicarbazone against s. aureus, e. faecalis, c. gattii and several isolates of p. brasiliensis indicated that this compound has the potential to be developed into novel drugs to treat infections caused these microbes.

TI  == the agr locus regulates virulence and colonization genes in clostridium difficile 027.
AB  == the transcriptional regulator agra, a member of the lyttr family of proteins, plays a key role in controlling gene expression in some gram-positive pathogens,  including staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. agra is encoded by the agracdb global regulatory locus, and orthologues are found within the genome of most clostridium difficile isolates, including the epidemic lineage 027/bi/nap1.  comparative rna sequencing of the wild type and otherwise isogenic agra null mutant derivatives of c. difficile r20291 revealed a network of approximately 75  differentially regulated transcripts at late exponential growth phase, including  many genes associated with flagellar assembly and function, such as the major structural subunit, flic. other differentially regulated genes include several involved in bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric gmp (c-di-gmp) synthesis and toxin a expression. c. difficile 027 r20291 agra mutant derivatives were poorly flagellated and exhibited reduced levels of colonization and relapses in the murine infection model. thus, the agr locus likely plays a contributory role in the fitness and virulence potential of c. difficile strains in the 027/bi/nap1 lineage.

TI  == photodynamic effect of hypericin on the microorganisms and primary human fibroblasts.
AB  == background: hypericin (hyp) is a natural photosensitizer considered for the new generation of photodynamic therapy (pdt) drugs. the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro bactericidal effect of hyp-pdt on four bacterial species, assessing its photocytotoxicity to primary human fibroblasts to determine possible side effects. methods: effect of photosensitizer concentration (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, and 1 mug/ml) and light irradiation time (3, 5, 10 min) on photodynamic inactivation of microorganisms and primary human fibroblasts was investigated. results: a 6.3 log killing was obtained for staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923) treated with 1 mug/ml at 48 j/cm(2). for this set of pdt parameters, enterococcus faecalis (atcc 11700) showed 6.5 log killing, escherichia coli (atcc 25922) 6.2 log killing, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853) 0.7 log killing. fibroblasts can be preserved by keeping the hyp concentration below 0.6 mug/ml and the light  dose below 48 j/cm(2). conclusion: s. aureus, e. faecalis, and e. coli appear to  be suitable for treatment with hyp-pdt without significant damage to fibroblasts.

TI  == preparation, characterization and antibacterial activity of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) electrospun fibers loaded with amoxicillin for controlled release in biomedical applications.
AB  == amoxicillin (amox) was successfully encapsulated at different concentrations into poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (pcl) by the electrospinning technique, and mats of non-woven fibers were obtained and characterized in terms of morphology, in vitro release and antibacterial properties. the scanning electron microscopy evidenced  the nanofibrous structure of the pristine pcl, composed of individual, uniform, and randomly oriented fibres with an average diameter ranging around 0.8 micron.  the addition of amoxicillin at different concentrations (3, 5 and 7 wt%) did not  evidence change in the fiber morphology. the release curves, for all samples, present mainly two stages: a first stage, quick as a "burst," is followed by a second slow stage. the burst was analyzed as a function of amoxicillin concentration and thickness of the membranes, and values corresponding to absence of burst were individuated. in the second stage the release was found very slow extending up to months for the most concentrated sample. the antibacterial activity of the electrospun fibers was effective to inhibit in different proportions staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli. the properties of the filled membranes and their capability for local delivery of antibiotics make them suitable for biomedical applications.

AB  == three inula species, i. viscosa, i. helenium ssp. turcoracemosa and i. montbretiana, collected from different locations of anatolia were investigated for their antioxidant and antimicrobial potential, and their total phenolic content and phenolic composition. antioxidant activities of various extracts of the plant parts were measured using dpph radical scavenging and abts assays. antimicrobial potential of methanol extracts of the plant parts was determined by the agar dilution method against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and candida tropicalis. all the extracts were more active against gram-positive bacteria and  yeasts than gram-negative bacteria. the extracts exhibited antioxidant and antimicrobial activities in different concentrations. total phenolic concentration of the extracts was estimated with folin-ciocalteu reagent using gallic acid as standard. the total phenolic content varied widely in different parts of the three tested inula species, ranging from 21.1 +/- 0.8 to 190.9 +/- 6.1 mg gae/g extract. phenolic components, such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, myricetin, quercetin, luteolin and kaempferol were quantified by hplc-dad in the methanol extracts of the inula species. it was obvious that the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of the plants were due to the phenolics.

TI  == candida albicans mucin msb2 is a broad-range protectant against antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == the human fungal pathogen candida albicans releases a large glycofragment of the  msb2 surface protein (msb2*) into the growth environment, which protects against  the action of human antimicrobial peptides (amps) ll-37 and histatin-5. quantitation of msb2*/ll-37 interactions by microscale thermophoresis revealed high-affinity binding (dissociation constant [kd] = 73 nm), which was lost or greatly diminished by lack of o-glycosylation or by msb2* denaturation. msb2* also interacted with human alpha- and beta-defensins and protected c. albicans against these amps. in addition, the lipopeptide antibiotic daptomycin was bound  and inactivated by msb2*, which prevented the killing of bacterial pathogens staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum. in coculturings or mixed biofilms of s. aureus with c. albicans wild-type but not msb2 mutant strains, the protective effects of msb2* on the bactericidal action of daptomycin were demonstrated. these results suggest that tight binding of shed msb2* to amps that occurs during bacterial coinfections with c. albicans compromises antibacterial therapy by inactivating a relevant reserve antibiotic.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == background: patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. this study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with cp.  methods: subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with cp in the united states. the samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/l, clindamycin at 4 mg/l, doxycycline at 4 mg/l, and metronidazole at 16 mg/l, with a post hoc combination of data for  amoxicillin and metronidazole. gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. results: overall, 74.2% of the patients with cp revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. one or more test species, most often prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, or aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with cp, respectively. fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either s. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). conclusions: patients with cp in the united states frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. the wide variability  found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with  cp.

TI  == volatile metabolites of pathogens: a systematic review.
AB  == ideally, invading bacteria are detected as early as possible in critically ill patients: the strain of morbific pathogens is identified rapidly, and antimicrobial sensitivity is known well before the start of new antimicrobial therapy. bacteria have a distinct metabolism, part of which results in the production of bacteria-specific volatile organic compounds (vocs), which might be used for diagnostic purposes. volatile metabolites can be investigated directly in exhaled air, allowing for noninvasive monitoring. the aim of this review is to provide an overview of vocs produced by the six most abundant and pathogenic bacteria in sepsis, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. such vocs could be used as biological markers in the diagnostic approach of critically ill patients. a systematic review of existing literature revealed 31 articles. all six bacteria of interest produce isopentanol, formaldehyde, methyl mercaptan, and trimethylamine. since humans do not produce these vocs, they could serve as biological markers for presence of these pathogens. the following volatile biomarkers were found for identification of specific strains: isovaleric acid and 2-methyl-butanal for staphylococcus aureus; 1-undecene, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptane, 2-butanone, 4-methyl-quinazoline, hydrogen cyanide, and methyl thiocyanide for pseudomonas aeruginosa; and methanol, pentanol, ethyl acetate, and indole for escherichia coli. notably, several factors that may effect voc production were not controlled for, including used culture media, bacterial growth phase, and genomic variation within bacterial strains. in conclusion, vocs produced by bacteria may serve as biological markers for their presence. goal-targeted studies should be performed to identify potential sets of volatile biological markers and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these markers in critically ill patients.

TI  == etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens from urinary tract infection.
AB  == urinary tract infection (uti) is the most common infection in both community and  hospital patients. in majority of the cases, empirical antimicrobial treatment is practiced before the laboratory results of urine culture. thus, antibiotic resistance may increase in urinary bacterial pathogens due to improper use of drugs. this study was designed to find out the etiological agents of uti and their prevalence, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial pathogens isolated from urine culture. this study was conducted in  kathmandu model hospital, kathmandu, nepal from april to october, 2009. midstream urine samples from 1323 patients suspected of uti were analyzed by microscopy, and conventional semi-quantitative culture technique for the significant growth.  antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed for the isolates by modified kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. data were analyzed using spss software window  version 16. the overall prevalence of uti was found to be 18.89%. the most frequent causative organisms isolated were escherichia coli (82.30%), enterococcus faecalis (5.60%), citrobacter freundii (3.60%), enterobacter aerogenes (2.40%), coagulase negative staphylococci (2.40%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.20%), proteus mirabilis (0.8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.4%), and staphylococcus aureus (0.4%). nitrofurantoin and amoxycillin were found to be the most effective antibiotic against gram negative and gram positive isolates respectively. e. coli was found to be the most common etiological agent of uti and nitrofurantoin was the most effective drug among the isolates.

TI  == new antibacterial germacrene from verbesina negrensis.
AB  == several health benefits have been attributed to members of the verbesina genus, including promotion of urinary and gastrointestinal health. verbesina species are also reported to exhibit antibacterial, antiparasitic, and antioxidant activities. although members of the verbesina genus produce various pharmacologically relevant chemicals as secondary metabolites, including eudesmanes, flavonoids, guanidine alkaloids, acetylenic compounds, and germacrenes, the active compounds required for these benefits remain unknown. to  investigate potential antimicrobial activities of verbesina negrensis, crude extracts from plant aerial structures were evaluated. following chemical fractionation, the chloroformic extract from verbesina negrensis was subjected to bioassay-guided isolation using disk diffusion assays to determine antimicrobial  activity. the active compound was characterized as 6beta-cinnamoyloxy-1beta-hydroxy-10alpha-metoxy-3-oxo-germacra-4,5z-ene (1). fractions containing 1 inhibited both enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29 212) and staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213). the mic for 1 was determined by microbroth dilution assay to be 64 microg/ml for both e. faecalis and s. aureus.

AB  == background: identification of pathogens associated with bovine mastitis is helpful in treatment and management decisions. however, such data from sub-saharan africa is scarce. here we describe the distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacteria from cows with clinical mastitis in kampala,  uganda. due to high concern of zoonotic infections, isolates from milkmen are also described. methodology/principal findings: ninety seven milk samples from cows with clinical mastitis and 31 nasal swabs from milkmen were collected (one sample per cow/human). fifty eight (60%) gram-positive isolates namely staphylococci (21), enterococci (16), streptococci (13), lactococci (5), micrococci (2) and arcanobacteria (1) were detected in cows; only one grew staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, 24 (25%) coliforms namely escherichia coli (12), klebsiella oxytoca (5), proteus vulgaris (2), serratia (2), citrobacter (1), cedecea (1) and leclercia (1) were identified. from humans, 24 gram-positive bacteria grew, of which 11 were staphylococci (35%) including four staphylococcus aureus. upon susceptibility testing, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) were prevalent; 57%, 12/21 in cows and 64%, 7/11 in humans.  however, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was not detected. furthermore, methicillin and vancomycin resistant cons were detected in cows (staphylococcus hominis, staphylococcus lugdunensis) and humans (staphylococcus scuiri). also, vancomycin and daptomycin resistant enterococci (enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, respectively) were detected in cows. coliforms were less resistant with three pan-susceptible isolates. however, multidrug resistant klebsiella, proteus, serratia, cedecea, and citrobacter were detected.  lastly, similar species grew from human and bovine samples but on genotyping, the isolates were found to be different. interestingly, human and bovine staphylococcus aureus were genetically similar (spa-cc435, spa-type t645 corresponding to st121) but with different susceptibility patterns. conclusions/significance: cons, enterococci, streptococci, and escherichia coli are the predominant pathogens associated with clinical bovine-mastitis in kampala, uganda. multidrug resistant bacteria are also prevalent. while similar species occurred in humans and cows, transmission was not detected.

TI  == evaluation of pharmacological activities, cytotoxicity and phenolic composition of four maytenus species used in southern african traditional medicine to treat intestinal infections and diarrhoeal diseases.
AB  == background: microbial infections and resulting inflammation and oxidative stress  are common pathogenesis of gastrointestinal tract (git) disorders. in south africa, several species of the genus maytenus are used in traditional medicine to treat various infectious diseases. most of the previous work on this genus was focused on nonpolar extracts from the root and bark. in this study, leaf extracts of polar extracts of maytenus peduncularis, maytenus procumbens, maytenus senegalensis and maytenus undata were evaluated for antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities to determine their efficacy as therapeutic agents in git disorders. methods: phenolic-enriched leaf extracts and fractions were prepared by extracting with acidified 70% methanol and solvent-solvent fractionation. the activities of the fractions against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus  faecalis as well as clinical isolates of aspergillus fumigatus, candida albicans  and cryptococcus neoformans were determined using a serial microplate dilution method. antioxidant activities were determined using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph), 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (abts), hydroxyl (oh) radical scavenging and linoleic acid peroxidation inhibitory assays. the phenolic composition as well as the cytotoxicity against vero cell lines of the crude extracts was evaluated using various standard protocols. results: the antimicrobial activities were concentrated in the non-polar fractions of hexane,  dichloromethane and ethyl acetate (mics 19-312 mug/ml). the crude extracts and polar fractions (butanol and water) had moderate to poor antimicrobial activity (mics 312 to above 2500 mug/ml). the crude extracts and polar fractions had good  antioxidant activity (ec50 values varied from 1.22 to 607 mug/ml, 1.71 to 312 mug/ml and 23 to 284 mug/ml for dpph, abts and oh respectively. linoleic acid peroxidation inhibition ec50 values of the crude extracts ranged between 27 and 39 mug/ml with relatively low toxicity against vero cell lines (ic50 values 87 to 187 mug/ml). fractionation of a crude extract with low activity could lead to fractions with more potent activity. conclusion: this study justifies the traditional use of leaf crude extracts and fractions from these four plants to remedy gastrointestinal disorders resulting from infection, inflammation and oxidative stress complications. the study also provides rationale for the use of  leaf extracts with same beneficial effects in place of unsustainable root and bark harvest.

TI  == high-throughput screening of inhibitors targeting agr/fsr quorum sensing in staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis employ cyclic peptide-mediated quorum sensing (qs) systems, termed agr and fsr respectively, to regulate the expression of a series of virulence genes. to identify quorum sensing inhibitors  (qsis) that target agr/fsr systems, an efficient screening system was established. in addition to the gelatinase-induction assay to examine e. faecalis fsr qs, the use of an s. aureus agr reporter strain that carries luciferase and green fluorescence protein genes under the agr p3 promoter facilitated the development of a high-throughput screen (hts) for qsis. as a result of screening  of 906 actinomycetes culture extracts, four showed qsi activity against the agr and fsr systems without growth inhibitory activity. the extracts were purified on a small scale, and three hplc peaks were obtained with obvious qsi activity. in sum, the established hts system is a promising strategy for the discovery of anti-pathogenic agents targeting cyclic peptide-mediated qs in gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == analysis of the tolerance of pathogenic enterococci and staphylococcus aureus to  cell wall active antibiotics.
AB  == objectives: tolerance refers to the phenomenon that bacteria do not significantly die when exposed to bactericidal antibiotics. enterococci are known for their high tolerance to these drugs, but the molecular reasons why they resist killing  are not understood. in a previous study we showed that the superoxide dismutase (sod) is implicated in this tolerance. this conclusion was based on the results obtained with one particular strain of enterococcus faecalis and therefore the objective of the present communication was to analyse whether dependence of tolerance on active sod is a general phenomenon for enterococci and another gram-positive pathogen, staphylococcus aureus. methods: mutants deficient in sod  activity were constructed in pathogenic enterococci. the wild-type soda gene was  cloned into an expression vector and transformed into sod-deficient strains for complementation with varying levels of sod activity. previously constructed sod-deficient strains of s. aureus were also included in this study. tolerance to vancomycin and penicillin was then tested. results: we demonstrated that the dependence on sod of tolerance to vancomycin and penicillin is a common trait of  antibiotic-susceptible pathogenic enterococci. by varying the levels of expression we could also show that tolerance to vancomycin is directly correlated to sod activity. interestingly, deletion of the soda gene in a non-tolerant enterococcus faecium strain did not further sensitize the mutant to bactericidal  antibiotics. finally, we showed that the sod enzymes of s. aureus are also implicated in tolerance to vancomycin. conclusion: high tolerance of enterococci  to cell wall active antibiotics can be reversed by sod deficiency.

TI  == redox balance via lactate dehydrogenase is important for multiple stress resistance and virulence in enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis is a highly stress resistant opportunistic pathogen. the intrinsic ruggedness of this bacterium is supposed to be the basis of its capacity to colonize the hostile environments of hospitals and to cause several kinds of infections. we show in this work that general resistance to very different environmental stresses depends on the ability of e. faecalis to maintain redox balance via lactate dehydrogenase (ldh). furthermore, ldh-deficient mutants are less successful than the wild type at colonizing host organs in a murine model of systemic infection. taken together, our results, as well as those previously published for staphylococcus aureus (a. r. richardson, s. j. libby, and f. c. fang, science 319:1672-1676, 2008), identify ldh as an attractive drug target. these drugs may have additional applications, as in the fight against glycopeptide antibiotic-resistant bacteria and even cancer.

TI  == bloodstream infections in patients with or without cancer in a large community hospital.
AB  == purpose: cancer is associated with an increased risk of acquiring bloodstream infection (bsis). most knowledge on pathogens and outcome are derived from specialised cancer centres. we here sought to compare causative micro-organisms in bsis in patients with or without cancer in a 600-bed teaching community hospital. methods: we analysed all positive blood cultures from adult patients between january 2005 and january 2011. results: a total of 4,918 episodes of bsi  occurred in 2,891 patients, of whom 13.4% had a diagnosis of cancer (85.5% with a solid tumour). in both patient groups, gram-positive isolates were more prevalent (58.7 and 61.4% in patients with and without cancer, respectively) than gram-negative isolates (31.8 and 32.3%, respectively). amongst gram-positive organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus and enterococci were the most frequently isolated in both patient groups; in cancer patients, twice as many bsis were caused by enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. amongst gram-negative organisms, escherichia coli was the most common isolate; in cancer patients, twice as many bsis were caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae. yeasts were grown from 3.0% of blood cultures from cancer patients compared to 1.5% of cultures from non-cancer patients. cancer patients had a 90-day mortality of 35.8% following bsi compared to 23.5% in patients without cancer. conclusion: these data demonstrate distinct bsi pathogens and impaired outcomes in patients with cancer in the setting of a large community teaching hospital.

TI  == interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices for hospital inpatients.
AB  == background: the first publication of this review in issue 3, 2005 included studies up to november 2003. this update adds studies to december 2006 and focuses on application of a new method for meta-analysis of interrupted time series studies and application of new cochrane effective practice and organisation of care (epoc) risk of bias criteria to all studies in the review, including those studies in the previously published version. the aim of the review is to evaluate the impact of interventions from the perspective of antibiotic stewardship. the two objectives of antibiotic stewardship are first to ensure effective treatment for patients with bacterial infection and second support professionals and patients to reduce unnecessary use and minimize collateral damage. objectives: to estimate the effectiveness of professional interventions that, alone or in combination, are effective in antibiotic stewardship for hospital inpatients, to evaluate the impact of these interventions on reducing the incidence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens or clostridium difficile infection and their impact on clinical outcome. search methods: we searched the cochrane central register of controlled trials (central), medline, embase from 1980 to december 2006 and the epoc specialized register in july 2007 and february 2009 and bibliographies of retrieved articles. the main comparison is between interventions that had a restrictive element and those that were purely persuasive. restrictive interventions were implemented through restriction of the freedom of prescribers to select some antibiotics. persuasive interventions used one or more of the following methods for changing professional behaviour: dissemination of educational resources, reminders, audit  and feedback, or educational outreach. restrictive interventions could contain persuasive elements. selection criteria: we included randomized clinical trials (rcts), controlled clinical trials (cct), controlled before-after (cba) and interrupted time series studies (its). interventions included any professional or structural interventions as defined by epoc. the intervention had to include a component that aimed to improve antibiotic prescribing to hospital inpatients, either by increasing effective treatment or by reducing unnecessary treatment. the results had to include interpretable data about the effect of the intervention on antibiotic prescribing or microbial outcomes or relevant clinical outcomes. data collection and analysis: two authors extracted data and assessed quality. we performed meta-regression of its studies to compare the results of persuasive and restrictive interventions. persuasive interventions advised physicians about how to prescribe or gave them feedback about how they prescribed. restrictive interventions put a limit on how they prescribed; for example, physicians had to have approval from an infection specialist in order to prescribe an antibiotic. we standardized the results of some its studies so that  they are on the same scale (percent change in outcome), thereby facilitating comparisons of different interventions. to do this, we used the change in level and change in slope to estimate the effect size with increasing time after the intervention (one month, six months, one year, etc) as the percent change in level at each time point. we did not extrapolate beyond the end of data collection after the intervention. the meta-regression was performed using standard weighted linear regression with the standard errors of the coefficients  adjusted where necessary. main results: for this update we included 89 studies that reported 95 interventions. of the 89 studies, 56 were itss (of which 4 were  controlled itss), 25 were rct (of which 5 were cluster-rcts), 5 were cbas and 3 were ccts (of which 1 was a cluster-cct).most (80/95, 84%) of the interventions targeted the antibiotic prescribed (choice of antibiotic, timing of first dose and route of administration). the remaining 15 interventions aimed to change exposure of patients to antibiotics by targeting the decision to treat or the duration of treatment. reliable data about impact on antibiotic prescribing data  were available for 76 interventions (44 persuasive, 24 restrictive and 8 structural). for the persuasive interventions, the median change in antibiotic prescribing was 42.3% for the itss, 31.6% for the controlled itss, 17.7% for the  cbas, 3.5% for the cluster-rcts and 24.7% for the rcts. the restrictive interventions had a median effect size of 34.7% for the itss, 17.1% for the cbas  and 40.5% for the rcts. the structural interventions had a median effect of 13.3% for the rcts and 23.6% for the cluster-rcts. data about impact on microbial outcomes were available for 21 interventions but only 6 of these also had reliable data about impact on antibiotic prescribing.meta-analysis of 52 its studies was used to compare restrictive versus purely persuasive interventions. restrictive interventions had significantly greater impact on prescribing outcomes at one month (32%, 95% confidence interval (ci) 2% to 61%, p = 0.03) and on microbial outcomes at 6 months (53%, 95% ci 31% to 75%, p = 0.001) but there were no significant differences at 12 or 24 months. interventions intended to decrease excessive prescribing were associated with reduction in clostridium difficile infections and colonization or infection with aminoglycoside- or cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. meta-analysis of clinical outcomes showed that four interventions intended to increase effective prescribing for pneumonia were associated with significant reduction in mortality (risk ratio 0.89, 95% ci 0.82 to 0.97), whereas nine interventions intended to decrease excessive prescribing were not associated with significant increase in mortality (risk ratio 0.92, 95% ci 0.81 to 1.06). authors' conclusions: the results show that interventions to reduce excessive antibiotic prescribing to hospital inpatients can reduce antimicrobial resistance or hospital-acquired infections, and interventions to increase effective prescribing can improve clinical outcome. this update provides more evidence about unintended clinical consequences of interventions and about the effect of interventions to reduce exposure of patients to antibiotics. the meta-analysis supports the use of restrictive interventions when the need is urgent, but suggests that persuasive and restrictive interventions are equally effective after six months.

TI  == identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  == traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target dna/rna. in the current study, the applicability of fish was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. to remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to fish, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. fish was performed using oligonucleotides  specific for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, and trueperella (arcanobacterium) pyogenes. the enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of fish were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) cfu/ml or higher. however, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) cfu/ml were not detectable in all cases. the ability of fish to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.

TI  == surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in indian.
AB  == objective: to record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. methods: urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (uti)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by kirby-bauer's disc  diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. results: from wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during april 2011 to september 2012. two gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), and nine gram-negative bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter sp., escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. both s. aureus and e. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. particularly, all gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for uti. conclusions: antibiograms of 11 uti-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus. moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis is a matter of concern.

AB  == the selective functionalization of vancomycin aglycon derivatives through conversion of the e-ring aryl chloride to a reactive boronic acid and its use in  the synthesis of a systematic series of vancomycin e-ring analogues are described. the series was used to examine the e-ring chloride impact in binding d-ala-d-ala and on antimicrobial activity. in contrast to the reduced activity of the unsubstituted e-ring derivatives, hydrophobic and relatively nonpolar substituents approach or match the chloro-substituted vancomycin and were insensitive to the electronic character of the substituent (e.g., cl vs cn/ome),  whereas highly polar substituents fail to provide the enhancements. moreover, the active permethylated vancomycin aglycon derivatives exhibit vanb vre antimicrobial activity at levels that approach (typically within 2-fold) their activity against sensitive bacteria. the robust borylation reaction also enabled  the functionalization of a minimally protected vancomycin aglycon (n-boc-vancomycin aglycon) and provides a direct method for the preparation of previously inaccessible analogues.

TI  == screening for polyphenols, antioxidant and antimicrobial activitiesof extracts from eleven helianthemum taxa (cistaceae) used in folk medicine in south-eastern  spain.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: the helianthemum genus contains approximately one hundred taxa. some of them are important medicinal plants used in several countries for many different purposes. however, studies addressing the phytochemistry of many of these species or their biological activities are currently nonexistent. aim of the study: to perform a comparative analysis of the qualitative composition of secondary metabolites and biological activities of the leaves of the most commonly distributed and used spanish helianthemum taxa in order to find a relationship between chemotype, biological activity and uses. materials and methods: water and 80% methanolic extracts derived from 11 different helianthemum taxa were analyzed for their phytochemical composition using standard methods. furthermore, hplc analysis was performed for the estimation of gallic acid, ellagic acid, tannins and flavonols as marker compounds. the antioxidant activity was measured by employing the scavenging activity on dpph (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and abts (2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) radicals. the 80% methanolic extracts were evaluated for antibacterial (gram-positive staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and listeria monocytogenes and gram-negative escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) activity using the micro dilution technique. results: the total polyphenolic content and antioxidant capabilities differed significantly among the helianthemum leaf extracts. a strong correlation between  total phenolic content, antioxidant properties and antimicrobial activity was found. the polyphenolic profile was specific for each taxon. whereas helianthemum alypoides, helianthemum cinereum subsp. rotundifolium, helianthemum hirtum, helianthemum asperum, and helianthemum marifolium subsp. marifolium were characterized by the presence of gallic acid, egallic derivatives and ellagitannins; the polyphenolic profile of helianthemum apenninum subsp. cavanillesianum, helianthemum syriacum and helianthemum polygonoides was mostly based on flavonoids. helianthemum cinereum, helianthemum alypoides and helianthemum marifolium consistently presented the strongest radical scavenging activity (in water extracts ec50 ranges from 29.88 to 38.1 against dpph and from  8.11 to 20.8 against abts, and in 80% meoh extracts from 25.3 to 31.8 against dpph and from 6.15 to 8.6 against abts), total phenol content (>117mg gae/l) and  antimicrobial activities. conclusion: the helianthemum taxa used in folk medicine did not cluster in a unique section, being equally distributed in two out of the  four sections analysed. there was not a clear relationship between the chemotype, based on the polyphenolic composition of the taxa, and their taxonomical classification. however, the composition of the methanolic and water extracts from the leaves of plants belonging to the helianthemum genus was strongly related to their medicinal uses.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis inhibits superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1-induced  interleukin-8 from human vaginal epithelial cells through tetramic acids.
AB  == the vaginal mucosa can be colonized by many bacteria including commensal organisms and potential pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus. some strains of s. aureus produce the superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, which can penetrate the vaginal epithelium to cause toxic shock syndrome. we have observed  that a female was mono-colonized with enterococcus faecalis vaginally as tested in aerobic culture, even upon repeated culture for six months, suggesting this organism was negatively influencing colonization by other bacteria. in recent studies, we demonstrated an "outside-in" mechanism of cytokine signaling and consequent inflammation that facilitates the ability of potential pathogens to initiate infection from mucosal surfaces. thus, we hypothesized that this strain  of e. faecalis may make anti-inflammatory factors which block disease progression of more pathogenic organisms. e. faecalis mn1 inhibited interleukin-8 production  from human vaginal epithelial cells in response to the vaginal pathogens candida  albicans, gardnerella vaginalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, as well as to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. we further demonstrated that this organism secretes two tetramic acid compounds which appear responsible for inhibition of interleukin-8  production, as well as inhibition of t cell proliferation due to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. microbicides that include anti-inflammatory molecules, such as  these tetramic acid compounds naturally produced by e. faecalis mn1, may be useful in prevention of diseases that develop from vaginal infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of pleurocidin is retained in plc-2, a c-terminal 12-amino acid fragment.
AB  == an analysis of a series of five peptides composed of various portions of the pleurocidin (plc) sequence identified a l2-amino acid fragment from the c-terminus of plc, designated plc-2, as the smallest fragment that retained a antimicrobial activity comparable to that of the parent compound. mic tests in vitro with low-ionic-strength medium showed that plc-2 has potent activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus but not against enterococcus faecalis. the antifungal activity of the synthetic peptides against phytopathogenic fungi, such as fusarium oxysporum, colletotrichum sp., aspergillus niger and alternaria sp., also identified plc-2 as a biologically active peptide. microscopy studies of fluorescently stained fungi treated with plc-2 demonstrated that cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes were compromised in all strains of phytopathogenic fungi tested. together, these results identify plc-2 as a potential antimicrobial agent with similar properties to its parent compound, pleurocidin. in addition, it demonstrated that the khvgkaalthyl residues are critical for the antimicrobial activity described for pleurocidin.

TI  == targeting agr- and agr-like quorum sensing systems for development of common therapeutics to treat multiple gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  == invasive infection by the gram-positive pathogen staphylococcus aureus is controlled by a four gene operon, agr that encodes a quorum sensing system for the regulation of virulence. while agr has been well studied in s. aureus, the contribution of agr homologues and analogues in other gram-positive pathogens is  just beginning to be understood. intriguingly, other significant human pathogens, including clostridium perfringens, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis contain agr or analogues linked to virulence. moreover, other significant human gram-positive pathogens use peptide based quorum sensing systems to establish or maintain infection. the potential for commonality in aspects of these signaling systems across different species raises the prospect of identifying therapeutics that could target multiple pathogens. here, we review the status of research into these agr homologues, analogues, and other peptide based quorum sensing systems in gram-positive pathogens as well as the potential  for identifying common pathways and signaling mechanisms for therapeutic discovery.

AB  == rapid identification of pathogens from blood cultures can decrease lengths of stay and improve patient outcomes. we evaluated the accuracy of the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) nucleic acid test for investigational use only (nanosphere, inc., northbrook, il) for the identification of gram-positive bacteria from blood cultures. the detection of resistance genes (meca in staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and vana or vanb in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis) by the bc-gp assay also was assessed. a total of 186 positive blood cultures (in bact/alert fa bottles) with  gram-positive cocci observed with gram staining were analyzed using the bc-gp assay. the bc-gp results were compared with the identification and susceptibility profiles obtained with routine methods in the clinical laboratory. discordant results were arbitrated with additional biochemical, cefoxitin disk, and repeat bc-gp testing. the initial bc-gp organism identification was concordant with routine method results for 94.6% of the blood cultures. only 40% of the streptococcus pneumoniae identifications were correct. the detection of the meca  gene for 69 blood cultures with only s. aureus or s. epidermidis was concordant with susceptibility testing results. for 3 of 6 cultures with multiple staphylococcus spp., meca detection was reported but was correlated with oxacillin resistance in a species other than s. aureus or s. epidermidis. the detection of vana agreed with susceptibility testing results for 45 of 46 cultures with e. faecalis or e. faecium. comparison of the mean times to results  for each organism group showed that bc-gp results were available 31 to 42 h earlier than phenotypic identifications and 41 to 50 h earlier than susceptibility results.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria collected from countries in eastern europe: results from the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) 2004-2010.
AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (t.e.s.t.) commenced in 2004 to longitudinally monitor global changes in bacterial susceptibility to a suite of antimicrobial agents. the current study examined the activity of tigecycline and  comparators against isolates collected across eastern europe between 2004 and 2010. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution methodologies. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using clsi interpretive criteria, and tigecycline susceptibility was established using european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) breakpoints. this study included 10 295 gram-negative and 4611 gram-positive isolates from 42 centres. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were reported among 15.3% of escherichia coli and 39.3% of klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; the highest rates were observed in turkey (30.9%) and bulgaria (53.8%), respectively. imipenem-non-susceptible k. pneumoniae were identified only in turkey. esbl-positive e. coli were highly susceptible to imipenem (95.1%), meropenem (98.0%) and tigecycline (98.5%). most antimicrobials showed poor activity against acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. vancomycin resistance was noted among 0.9% of enterococcus faecalis and 11.7% of enterococcus faecium isolates. high rates of susceptibility were reported for linezolid (99.7%) and tigecycline (100%) against e. faecium. one-quarter of staphylococcus aureus isolates were meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), with the highest rate in romania (51.5%); all mrsa were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. antimicrobial resistance is high in much of eastern europe, with considerable variation seen among countries. tigecycline and the carbapenems retain excellent activity against many pathogens from eastern europe; linezolid and vancomycin are active against most gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == in situ synthesis and antibacterial activity of copper nanoparticle loaded natural montmorillonite clay based on contact inhibition and ion release.
AB  == copper nanoparticle based clay composite has been synthesized by in situ reduction of a copper ammonium complex ion and characterized by different analytical instruments. the copper nanoparticles were both intercalated and adsorbed on the surface with diameters of <5nm (for intercalated) and 25-30nm (for adsorbed). the composite showed good stability for over 3 months in air. excellent antimicrobial activity of the composite was observed on escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis with mortality rates >90% after 12h. cellular membrane damage permeated by direct attachment of the composite and indirect damage caused by released copper ion are the primary sources of antibacterial action. cytotoxicity measurements showed minimal adverse effect on the two human cell lines beyond the m.b.c. value for the microorganisms studied. in the present form the clay composite shows good promise for use in therapeutic applications.

TI  == combined treatments of enterocin as-48 with biocides to improve the inactivation  of methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus planktonic and sessile cells.
AB  == control of staphylococci during cleaning and disinfection is important to the food industry. broad-spectrum bacteriocins with proved anti-staphylococcal activity, such as enterocin as-48, could open new possibilities for disinfection  in combination with biocides. in the present study, enterocin as-48 was tested singly or in combination with biocides against a cocktail of six staphylococcus aureus strains (including three methicillin-resistant strains) in planktonic state as well as in biofilms formed on polystyrene microtiter plates. cells were  challenged with enterocin, biocides or enterocin/biocide combinations. inactivation of planktonic cells increased significantly (p<0.05) when enterocin  as-48 (25mg/l) was tested in combination with benzalkonium chloride (bc), cetrimide (ct) and hexadecylpyridinium chloride (hdp), and non-significantly in combination with didecyldimethylammonium bromide (ab), triclosan (tc), hexachlorophene (cf), polyhexamethylen guanidinium chloride (phmg), chlorhexidine (ch) or p3-oxonia (ox). in the sessile state (24h biofilms), staphylococci required higher biocide concentrations in most cases, except for ox. inactivation of sessile staphylococci increased remarkably when biocides were applied in combination with enterocin as-48, especially when the bacteriocin was added at 50mg/l. during storage, the concentrations of sessile as well as planktonic cells in the treated samples decreased remarkably for bc, tc and phmg, but ox failed to inhibit proliferation of the treated biofilms as well as growth of planktonic cells. the observed inhibitory effects during storage were potentiated when the biocides were combined with 50 mg/l enterocin as-48. results from this study suggest that selected combinations of enterocin as-48 and biocides offer potential use against planktonic and sessile, methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant s. aureus.

TI  == cd137 expressed on neutrophils plays dual roles in antibacterial responses against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB  == severe sepsis and septic shock caused mainly by bacterial infections are life-threatening conditions that urge the development of novel therapies. however, host responses to and pathophysiology of sepsis have not been clearly understood, which remains a major obstacle for the development of effective therapeutics. recently, we have shown that stimulation of a costimulatory molecule, cd137, enhanced survival of mice infected with the gram-positive (g(+)) intracellular bacterium listeria monocytogenes but decreased survival in a polymicrobial sepsis model. herein, we report that cd137 deficiency or blocking of cd137 signaling decreased antibacterial responses of mice infected with g(+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis) but increased these responses in mice infected with gram-negative (g(-)) bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium). consistent with these findings, stimulation of cd137 by administration of agonistic antibody enhanced responses against g(+) bacteria, whereas it decreased these responses against g(-) bacteria. neutrophils were responsible for cd137-mediated opposite roles in control of g(+) and g(-) bacterial infections. stimulation of cd137 enhanced activities of neutrophils against s. aureus but decreased these activities against e. coli, while cd137 blocking produced opposite results with the stimulation of cd137 in vivo and in vitro. furthermore, we found that combined signaling of cd137 and toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) induced synergistic production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6) by neutrophils, but combined signaling of cd137 and tlr4 did not. our data strongly suggest that cd137 may play a dual role in sepsis in association with tlrs.

TI  == broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of carbon nanotubes to human gut bacteria.
AB  == carbon nanotubes (cnts) hold promise in manufacturing, environmental, and biomedical applications, as well as food and agricultural industries. previous observations have shown that cnts have antimicrobial activity; however, the impact of cnts to human gut microbes has not been investigated. here, the antibacterial activity of cnts against the microbes commonly encountered in the human digestion system--l. acidophilus, b. adolescentis, e. coli, e. faecalis, and s. aureus--are evaluated. the bacteria studied include pathogenic and non-pathogenic, gram-positive and negative, and both sphere and rod strains. in this study, cnts, including single-walled cnts (swcnts, 1-3 mum), short and long  multi-walled cnts (s-mwcnts: 0.5-2 mum; l-mwcnts: >50 mum), and functionalized multi-walled cnts (hydroxyl- and carboxyl-modification, 0.5-2 mum), all have broad-spectrum antibacterial effects. notably, cnts may selectively lyse the walls and membranes of human gut microbes, depending on not only the length and surface functional groups of cnts, but also the shapes of the bacteria. the mechanism of antibacterial activity is associated with their diameter-dependent piercing and length-dependent wrapping on the lysis of microbial walls and membranes, inducing release of intracellular components dna and rna and allowing  a loss of bacterial membrane potential, demonstrating complete destruction of bacteria. thin and rigid swcnt show more effective wall/membrane piercing on spherical bacteria than mwcnts. long mwcnt may wrap around gut bacteria, increasing the area making contact with the bacterial wall. this work suggests that cnts may be broad-spectrum and efficient antibacterial agents in the gut, and selective application of cnts could reduce the potential hazard to probiotic  bacteria.

TI  == [microbial and pharmacological characteristics of vancogenx].
AB  == purpose of the study: prosthetic joint infection is a feared complication in total hip arthroplasty. the use of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement is the important part of preventive and therapeutic strategies. at present a number of commercial bone cements are available and support of their use by the results of  experimental trials and clinical studies has varied. in relation to this issue we studied essential microbiological and pharmacological characteristics of vancogenx in comparison with gentamicin-loaded bone cement used conventionally. material and methods: based on a previously described protocol, we tested pellets of four commercial bone cements, namely, hi-fatigue g, palacos r+g, vancogenx, and palacos r as a control. bone cement was prepared in a vacuum-mixing system. the strains used for bacterial load included staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli. each cement was tested for its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities and the results were evaluated by standard methods. in addition, we investigated time-related release of gentamicin and vancomycin from the bone cements tested. results: all antibiotic-loaded cement pellets were able to prevent growth of the bacterial strains tested. the bactericidal effect lasted for several days in relation to the bacterial species and cement used, with the exception of s. epidermidis whose growth was inhibited by gentamicin-loaded cement only for one day. the antibiotic-loaded pellets also prevented the formation of a biofilm for 24 hours at least. the major amount of vancomycin (32.915 mg/l) was released from vancogenx to mh medium within 24 hours and the last measureable amount (4.327 mg/l) was recorded at 48 hours after the start of  the experiment. in physiological saline the highest level of vancomycin was 139.852 mg/ml measured at 24 hours, and the antibiotic was detectable at a level  of 2.334 mg/ml as late as 8 days after the experiment started. release of gentamicin from vancogenx was as follows: the 24-hour level was higher in mh medium than physiological saline (178 versus 131.4 mg/ml); however, gentamicin was still detectable in physiological saline at 192 hours after the start of the  experiment while no gentamicin was found in mh medium after 72 hours. discussion: the antimicrobial effect of vancogenx bone cement was not an unexpected finding since both gentamicin and vancomycin have been used with bone cement for a long time and their combination is optimal in terms of preventing prosthetic joint infection. however, there is a disputable issue of poor release of vancomycin from bone cement. in mh medium we were able to detect the vancomycin released from vancogenx only for two days after the initial rapid elution while its release into physiological saline seemed to be slower but much longer. it is possible that more vancomycin is released from bone cement, but this amount is immediately bound to proteins in the cement vicinity and this process is not detectable by any analytical method. conclusions: the bone cement vancogenx showed excellent antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties and can be recommended  for use in orthopaedic practice. therapy of prosthetic joint infection is the main indication. extension of the indication to the prevention of prosthetic joint infection in high-risk patients should be preceded by biomechanical studies demonstrating that the cement is appropriate for long-term implant fixation.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar  diffusion method. the essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and  gram-negative strains (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for most essential oils examined, s. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while p. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. in general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.

(family: sonneratiaceae), is one of the foreshore plants found in estuarine and tidal creek areas and mangrove forests. bark and fruit extracts from this plant have previously been shown to have an anti-oxidative or cytotoxic effect, whereas flower extracts of this plant exhibited an antimicrobial activity against some bacteria. according to the traditional folklore, it is medicinally used as an astringent and antiseptic. hence, this investigation was carried out on the extract of the leaves, pneumatophore and different parts of the flower or fruit (stamen, calyx, meat of fruit, persistent calyx of fruit and seeds) for antibacterial activity using the broth microdilution method. the antibacterial activity was evaluated against five antibiotic-sensitive species (three gram-positive and two gram-negative bacteria) and six drug-resistant species (gram-positive i.e. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and gram-negative i.e. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-escherichia coli, multidrug-resistant-pseudomonas aeruginosa and acenetobacter baumannii). the methanol extracts from all tested parts of the crabapple mangrove tree exhibited antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, but was mainly a bactericidal against the gram-negative bacteria, including the multidrug-resistant strains, when compared with only bacteriostatic on the gram-positive bacteria. using soxhlet apparatus, the extracts obtained by sequential extraction with hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate revealed no discernable antibacterial activity  and only slightly, if at all, reduced the antibacterial activity of the subsequently obtained methanol extract. therefore, the active antibacterial compounds of the crabapple mangrove tree should have a rather polar structure.

TI  == infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  == the present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. the waste  was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in penang island, malaysia. the presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste  was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella spp., klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. the presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rdna analysis. in this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, lysinibacillus sphaericus, serratia marcescens, and staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. the present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or  either of the clinical wastes.

TI  == comparative potencies of contemporary generic vancomycin lot: in vitro assay results from nine products and a reference reagent-grade sample.
AB  == numerous studies of generic vancomycin (gv) lots have emerged since the 1980s, casting some doubt on product quality. publications question the in vivo activity, even when concurrent in vitro and chemical assays meet regulatory guidelines. this study assessed contemporary gv lots by an in vitro assay capable of measuring small variations from target-benchmark (bm) activity. nine gv lots (hospira [6 lots; 0.5- or 1.0-g vials], akorn [1 lot; 1.0-g vial], app [2 lots; 1.0-g vials]) were obtained from local united states distributors. a reagent-grade lot (sigma lot 080m1341v) was tested as bm component due to the inability to purchase branded product vials in the usa. all lots of gv did not vary significantly from the analytical control when testing the 3 staphylococcus  aureus (wild-type 4b25, atcc 25923, and 29213) and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212) strains. these mic end points were read at 18 h of incubation, and hospira lots averaged +3.5% potency (range, -3% to +8%), and akorn and app at 0% variance, e.g., acceptable performance. in conclusion, with a validated, precise  multi-organism assay, current gv lots marketed in the usa showed minimal activity variations from a selected bm control lot. generic antimicrobial products, in general, should be regularly monitored for potency, chemical purity, and in vivo  activity before routine use in medical centers.

TI  == preparation of some eco-friendly corrosion inhibitors having antibacterial activity from sea food waste.
AB  == chitosan is one of the important biopolymers and it is extracted from exoskeletons of crustaceans in sea food waste. it is a suitable eco-friendly carbon steel corrosion inhibitor in acid media; the deacetylation degree of prepared chitosan is more than 85.16 %, and the molecular weight average is 109 kda. chitosan was modified to 2-n,n-diethylbenzene ammonium chloride n-oxoethyl chitosan (compound i), and 12-ammonium chloride n-oxododecan chitosan (compound ii) as soluble water derivatives. the corrosion inhibition efficiency for carbon  steel of compound (i) in 1 m hcl at varying temperature is higher than for chitosan and compound (ii). however, the antibacterial activity of chitosan for enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans is higher than for its derivatives, and the minimum inhibition concentration and minimum bacterial concentration of chitosan and its derivatives were carried out with the same strain.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial and allelopathic activity of tunisian conyza sumatrensis (retz.) e.walker essential oils.
AB  == conyza sumatrensis (retz.) e.walker (asteraceae) is a spontaneous annual herb, fairly widespread throughout tunisia, which has rarely been studied or valued in  any sector. essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation of different parts  (flower heads, leaves, stems, and roots) of c. sumatrensis plants, which were collected in autumn (november 2007) at the flowering stage in the area of monastir, tunisia. in total, 98 compounds, representing 88.1-99.3% of the oil composition, were identified by gc-fid and gc/ms analyses. the root essential oil was distinguished by its high content in acetylenes (matricaria ester, 4; 74.3%), while those from flower heads and leaves were dominated by oxygenated sesquiterpenes (61.1 and 50.3%, resp.). the oils of c. sumatrensis from tunisia belonged to a matricaria ester/caryophyllene oxide chemotype. all the oils were evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal, and allelopathic activities. the results indicate that the leaf oil exhibited significant in vitro antibacterial activity  against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and proteus mirabilis and that the c. sumatrensis oils isolated from the aerial parts presented high mycelia-growth inhibition of candida albicans and the filamentous fungi tested. moreover, the essential oils of the different plant parts inhibited the shoot and root growth of raphanus sativus (radish) seedlings. indeed, the inhibition of the hypocotyl growth varied from 28.6 to 90.1% and that of the radicle from 42.3 to 96.2%.

TI  == assessment of a semi-automated protocol for multiplex analysis of sepsis-causing  bacteria with spiked whole blood samples.
AB  == sepsis is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. rapid and reliable diagnostic methods are needed for efficient and evidence-based treatment of septic patients. recently, new molecular tools have emerged to complement the  conventional culture-based diagnostic methods. in this study, we used spiked whole blood samples to evaluate together two ready-to-use molecular solutions for the detection of sepsis-causing bacteria. we spiked whole blood with bacterial species relevant in sepsis and extracted bacterial dna with the nordiag arrow device, using the selectna blood pathogen dna isolation kit. dna extracts were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr)- and microarray-based prove-it bone and joint assay, resulting in correctly identified bacterial species with detection limits of 11-600 colony-forming unit/ml (cfu/ml). to understand the recovery losses of bacterial dna during the sample preparation step and the capability of the pcr- and microarray-based platform to respond to the sensitivity requirements, we also determined the analytical sensitivity of the pcr and microarray platform to be 1-21 genome equivalents for the tested bacterial species. in addition, the inclusivity of the prove-it bone and joint assay was demonstrated with methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) clones carrying sccmec types i, ii, iv, or v and a nontypable sccmec type. the proof-of-concept for accurate multiplex pathogen and antibacterial resistance marker detection from spiked whole blood samples was demonstrated by the selective bacterial dna extraction method combined with the high-throughput pcr-  and microarray-based platform. further investigations are needed to study the promising potential of the concept for sensitive, semi-automated identification of sepsis-causing pathogens directly from whole blood.

TI  == biological approach to synthesize tio2 nanoparticles using aeromonas hydrophila and its antibacterial activity.
AB  == nanosized materials have been an important subject in basic and applied sciences. a novel, low-cost, green and reproducible bacteria, aeromonas hydrophila mediated biosynthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (tio2 nps) was reported. the resulting nanoparticles were characterized by ftir, xrd, afm and fesem with edx.  ftir showed characteristic bands (1643 and 3430 cm(-1)) finds the role of carboxyl group oh stretching amine nh stretch in the formation of tio2 nps. the xrd spectrum confirmed that the synthesized tio2 nps were in the form of nanocrystals, as evidenced by the peaks at 2theta values of 27.47 degrees , 31.77 degrees , 36.11 degrees , 41.25 degrees , 54.39 degrees , 56.64 degrees and 69.54 degrees were identified as 110, 100, 101, 111, 211, 220 and 301 reflections, respectively. the crystallite sizes were calculated using scherrer's formula applied to the major intense peaks and found to be the size of 40.50 nm. the morphological characterization was analyzed by fesem and the analysis showed the  nps smooth shaped, spherical and uneven. gc-ms analysis showed the main compounds found in a. hydrophila were uric acid (2.95%), glycyl-l-glutamic acid (6.90%), glycyl-l-proline (74.41%) and l-leucyl-d-leucine (15.74%). the potential glycyl-l-proline could have played an important role as a capping agent. a possible mechanism for the biosynthesis of tio2 nps has been proposed. the antibacterial activity of the synthesized tio2 nps was assessed by well diffusion method toward a. hydrophila, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis and showed effective inhibitory activity against s. aureus (33 mm) and s. pyogenes (31 mm).

TI  == ochnaflavone and ochnaflavone 7-o-methyl ether two antibacterial biflavonoids from ochna pretoriensis (ochnaceae).
AB  == the acetone extract of ochna pretoriensis was evaluated for antibacterial activity using bioautography and serial microplate dilution methods against four  nosocomial bacterial pathogens namely: escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extract led to the isolation of two antibacterial biflavonoids, ochnaflavone and ochnaflavone 7-o-methyl ether. gram-negative bacteria were more  sensitive to the isolated compounds than the gram-positive bacteria (mic values:  31.3 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa and 62.5 microg/ml for s. aureus). in addition,  the isolated compounds were assessed for their potential toxic effects in the mtt toxicity assay using monkey kidney vero cells and ames genotoxicity test using salmonella typhimurium strain ta98. lc50 values were 125.9 microg/ml for ochnaflavone and 162.0/microg/ml for ochnaflavone 7-o-methyl ether. the isolated  compounds have selectivity index values ranging from 1.29 to 4.03. selectivity index values higher than one indicate that test samples are less toxic to the host cells than to the pathogens. the biflavonoids did not have any mutagenic effects in the salmonella/microsome assay without metabolic activation.

TI  == detection and new genetic environment of the pleuromutilin-lincosamide-streptogramin a resistance gene lsa(e) in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus of swine origin.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the genetic basis of pleuromutilin resistance in porcine methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and to map the genetic environment of the identified plasmid-borne resistance gene. methods: seventy porcine mrsa isolates, which exhibited high mics of tiamulin, valnemulin and retapamulin, were investigated for pleuromutilin resistance genes and mutations.  they were characterized by staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec) typing, spa typing and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). plasmid dna was extracted from the lsa(e)-positive strains and transferred to s. aureus rn4220 for selection of resistance plasmids. the plasmid-borne lsa(e) gene region was sequenced and 10 overlapping pcr assays for the analysis of the genetic environment of lsa(e) were developed. results: all 70 mrsa isolates were st9 (mlst)-t899 (spa)-iva (sccmec). sixteen isolates carried the lsa(e) gene; all others were negative for known pleuromutilin resistance mechanisms. an lsa(e)-carrying plasmid of approximately 41 kb was detected in a single isolate.  sequence analysis revealed that the lsa(e) gene was located in a multiresistance  gene cluster, which showed partial homology to clusters identified in mrsa, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) and enterococcus faecalis. pcr analysis  of the remaining isolates revealed a partly deleted multiresistance gene cluster  in 6/15 isolates and solely the lsa(e) gene without the known flanking regions in 9/15 isolates. conclusions: we identified the pleuromutilin-lincosamide-streptogramin a resistance gene lsa(e) in porcine mrsa  isolates. the multiresistance gene cluster in which lsa(e) was located differed from the previously described ones found in human mrsa/mssa or in e. faecalis. the location of lsa(e) on a multiresistance plasmid facilitates its persistence and dissemination.

TI  == bacteriocin pj4 active against enteric pathogen produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4 isolated from gut microflora of wistar rat (rattus norvegicus): partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin.
AB  == the increase of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the restriction on the use antibiotics due to its side effects have drawn attention to the search for possible alternatives. bacteriocins are small antimicrobial peptides produced by  numerous bacteria. much interest has been focused on bacteriocins because they exhibit inhibitory activity against pathogens. lactic acid bacteria possess the ability to synthesize antimicrobial compounds (like bacteriocin) during their growth. in this study, an antibacterial substance (bacteriocin pj4) produced by lactobacillus helveticus pj4, isolated from rat gut microflora, was identified as bacteriocin. it was effective against wide assay of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria involved in various diseases, including escherichia coli,  bacillus subtilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. the antimicrobial peptide was relatively heat-resistant and also active over a wide ph range of 2-10. it has been partially purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation and size exclusion chromatography and checked on reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of bacteriocin pj4 purified through size exclusion chromatography resolved ~6.5 kda  protein with bacteriocin activity. the peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, trypsin, and lipase but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, and pepsin. it showed a bactericidal mode of action against the indicator strains e. coli mtcc443, lactobacillus casei mtcc1423, and e. faecalis dt48. such characteristics indicate that this bacteriocin may be a potential candidate for alternative agents to control important pathogens.

TI  == [analysis of bactericidal material generated by electrical devices advertising bactericidal ability against bacteria on the agar gel plates].
AB  == several japanese companies sell electrical devices advertised as effective in inactivating viruses and killing bacteria by releasing special materials, e.g., plasmacluster ions, nanoe particle and minus ions, into the air. these companies  claim that their devices killed bacteria on plates in their own experiments. we tested device effectiveness using the same experiments from the plasmacluster ioniser sharp co., japan, the nanoe generator panasonic co., japan, and the vion  king jim co., japan, to test their advertising claims. bactericidal ability on agar plate was tested, using staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis as follows: the medium containing a certain amount of each bacterium was put onto an agar plate and smeared. plates were kept in a closed chamber (inner volume 14.4 m3) or a glove box (inner volume 0.2 m), with one of the devices run for 2 hours. plates not exposed to any device were used as controls. each plate was retrieved and put in an incubator to count  the number of bacterial colonies formed on the plate. there was no significant difference in the number of colonies on plates exposed to devices compared to control, in the number for all devices, or in all bacteria tested in experiments  in the 14.4 m3 chamber. these results strongly suggest that these devices have almost no bactericidal effect, at least in space exceeding this volume. colony formation was suppressed in the glove box in all devices and in all bacteria tested except p. aeruginosa, although the degree of suppression differed among experiments. the colony formation suppression mechanism was analyzed, and indicated that:colony formation did not change even after the removal of plasmacluster ions, nanoe particles, or negative ions from the air, while colony  formation was decreased drastically by the removal of ozone from space, which was revealed to be generated inevitably during device operation. these results strongly suggest that the bactericidal effect seen only on the agar plate in narrow space was explained by ozone released in space as a by-product, not by special materials as advertising claimed. it is thus important to analyze the effect of special materials such as those done in this study and to suggest the involvement of ozone as the true cause, as have been done in this study, in evaluating bactericidal effect or viral inactivation as advertised by these companies.

TI  == evidence for bacteria-independent hatching of trichuris muris eggs.
AB  == hatching of infective larvae from embryonated eggs in the intestine is an essential first step in trichuris infections. there are three isolates of the murine parasitic nematode trichuris muris: e, e-j (the e isolate maintained in japan), and s. incubation of t. muris embryonated eggs with the intestinal bacteria escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus induced in vitro hatching of  the eggs, but enterococcus faecalis failed to induce hatching. bacteria-induced in vitro hatching of embryonated eggs occurred in the e and e-j isolates, whereas the s isolate was unresponsive to bacteria. t. muris worms recovered from infected mice showed no significant difference between the e-j and s isolates in  their infectivity to susceptible b10.br mice (p>0.05). in vivo hatching of embryonated eggs occurred at 30 min post-infection in the upper and lower halves  of the small intestine of ddy mice infected with the e-j or s isolates, and on average, 65% of embryonated eggs recovered from the upper half of the small intestine were hatched in both the e-j and s isolates. in comparison with enterococcus, the bacteria e. coli and s. aureus represent relatively minor components of the flora of the upper half of the small intestine of mice. these observations point to the possibility that bacteria-independent hatching might also occur in vivo, at least for the s isolate, and imply the existence of a very different system of induction of hatching in vivo.

AB  == atp modulates immune cell functions, and atp derived from gut commensal bacteria  promotes the differentiation of t helper 17 (th17) cells in the intestinal lamina propria. we recently reported that enterococcus gallinarum, isolated from mice and humans, secretes atp. we have since found and characterized several atp-secreting bacteria. of the tested enterococci, enterococcus mundtii secreted  the greatest amount of atp (>2 mum/10(8) cells) after overnight culture. glucose, not amino acids and vitamins, was essential for atp secretion from e. mundtii. analyses of energy-deprived cells demonstrated that glycolysis is the most important pathway for bacterial atp secretion. furthermore, exponential-phase e.  mundtii and enterococcus faecalis cells secrete atp more efficiently than stationary-phase cells. other bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus, also secrete atp in exponential but  not stationary phase. these results suggest that various gut bacteria, including  commensals and pathogens, might secrete atp at any growth phase and modulate immune cell function.

TI  == propeptide processing and proteolytic activity of proenzymes of the staphylococcal and enterococcal gluv8-family protease.
AB  == proenzymes with various lengths of propeptides have been observed in gluv8 from staphylococcus aureus and gluse from s. epidermidis. however, the production mechanism of these proenzymes and roles of truncated propeptides have yet to be elucidated. here we demonstrate that shortening of propeptide commonly occurs in  an auto-catalytic manner in gluv8-family members, including those from coagulase  negative staphylococci and enterococcus faecalis. accompanied with propeptide shortening, the pro-mature junction (asn/ser_1-val1) becomes more susceptible towards the hetero-catalytic maturation enzymes. the auto-catalytic propeptide truncation is not observed in ser169ala inert molecules of gluv8-family members.  a faint proteolytic activity of proenzymes from staphylococcus caprae and e. faecalis is detected. in addition, proteolytic activity of proenzyme of gluv8 carrying arg-3alaasn.1 is demonstrated with synthetic peptide substrates lle/q-mca. these results suggest that gluv8-family proenzymes with shortened propeptides intrinsically possess proteolytic activity and are involved in the propeptide shortening that facilitates the final hetero-catalytic maturation.

AB  == bloodstream infections (bsis) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and impose considerable costs on healthcare systems. a key predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with bsis is the early initiation of appropriate targeted antimicrobial therapy. however, with conventional blood culture methods, the gold standard, there is a significant time delay of approximately 2-3 days before clinical results are available, with many patients receiving inappropriate and/or unnecessary antimicrobial therapy in the interim. during the past two decades, the use of in vitro assays that utilize nucleic acid amplification-based detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns has led to a significant reduction in the time (hours vs. days with blood culture) to detection and identification of several of the causative pathogens of bsis and, potentially, earlier initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy. this review focuses on the  properties and clinical use of one of these molecular diagnostic assays, the verigene((r)) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (bc-gp), which detects many of the potentially pathogenic gram-positive bacteria associated with bsis, including staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., listeria spp., and enterococcus spp., and specific resistance markers (meca, vana, and vanb). based  on more than 1,600 samples, there was a high degree of agreement between bc-gp test results and those obtained using conventional blood culture and assay methods, irrespective of whether samples were fresh or frozen, and a high degree  of agreement for identification of meca-mediated meticillin resistance in s. aureus and s. epidermidis organisms and vana- or vanb-mediated vancomycin resistance in e. faecalis and e. faecium organisms.

TI  == preferable timing of therapeutic drug monitoring in patients with impaired renal  function treated with once-daily administration of vancomycin.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the timing of therapeutic drug monitoring (tdm) in patients with impaired renal function treated with once-daily administration of vancomycin (vcm). once-daily administration was selected for patients whose creatinine clearance (ccr) was <80 ml/min. tdm was conducted on day 3 or on day 4. adult patients whose vcm dosage was not altered according to initial c min and for whom subsequent follow-up tdm was performed within 1 week were entered into the study. patients whose renal function deteriorated at follow-up tdm were excluded. one hundred sixty-five patients were eligible for analysis. among patients with once-daily dosing, relative increases of c min at follow-up tdm compared with initial tdm were 34.5 +/- 39.2 % in tdm on day 3 and  16.6 +/- 20.6 % in tdm on day 4 (p = 0.016). in contrast, there was no significant difference in the relative increase of c min between tdm on days 3 and 4 (26.1 +/- 39.6 vs. 18.4 +/- 25.6 %, p = 0.551) in the twice-daily regimen.  on multivariate analysis, tdm on day 3 alone (odds ratio, 4.93; 95 % confidence interval, 1.71-14.2) was selected as an independent risk factor associated with a relative increase of c min by >30 % in the once-daily regimen. steady-state vcm serum concentration was not achieved on day 3 in the once-daily regimen in patients with impaired renal function, and tdm on day 3 caused underestimation of c min.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == comparing effects of freezing at -196 degrees c and -20 degrees c on the viability of mastitis pathogens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the effects of cryopreservation at approximately -196 degrees c in liquid nitrogen (n) and freezing at approximately -20 degrees c in a freezer, on the viability and survival of eight different mastitogenic bacteria inoculated in milk. bacteria were frozen at approximately -20 degrees c in a freezer and cryopreserved at approximately -196 degrees c in liquid nitrogen. an effective preservation method was needed for follow-up samples from cows identified in the south african national milk recording scheme  (nmrs) with somatic cell counts above 250 000 cells/ml milk. the organisation responsible for sample collection of the nmrs milk samples also provides producers with liquid nitrogen for their semen flasks at the collection sites. this existing mode of storage and transport could therefore be utilised.ten samples of each organism were thawed and cultured bi-weekly until week 18 for both temperature treatments. an additional sampling was performed at week 30 for  samples frozen at approximately -20 degrees c. freezing and cryopreservation did  not impair subsequent isolation of streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus uberis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus (sth) (phage type lytic group iii) or sta. aureus (sta) (phage typed, other than lytic group iii). survival was indicated by the isolation of bacteria from samples, and viability by the strength of growth of the bacteria isolated. the survival of streptococcus agalactiae decreased after week 12 and escherichia coli after week 16 of freezing, but both organisms survived under cryogenic preservation until week 18. coagulase-negative staphylococci survived until week 18 for both freezing and cryogenic preservation.both storage methods could thus contribute to the improvement of a pro-active approach towards udder health management in south african dairy herds.

TI  == antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of 7-hydroxy-calamenene-rich essential oils from croton cajucara benth.
AB  == croton cajucara is a shrub native to the amazon region locally known as "sacaca". two morphotypes are known: white and red "sacaca". the essential oils (eo) obtained by hydrodistillation from leaves of the red morphotype were, in general, rich in 7-hydroxycalamenene (28.4%-37.5%). the effectiveness of these eo regarding the antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms was initially investigated by the drop test method, showing significant inhibition zones. among the microorganisms tested, the essential oils rich in 7-hydroxycalamenene were more effective against methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis,  m. smegmatis, mucor circinelloides and rhizopus oryzae. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the oils were determined using the broth dilution assay.  it was possible to observe that 7-hydroxycalamenene-rich oils presented high antimicrobial activity, with mic of 4.76 x 10(-)(3) mug/ml for mrsa, 4.88 mug/ml  for m. tuberculosis, 39.06 mug/ml for m. smegmatis, and 0.152 mug/ml for r. oryzae and 3.63 x 10(-)(8) mug/ml for m. circinelloides. the antioxidant activity of this eo suggests that 7-hydroxycalamenene provides more antioxidant activity according with ec(50) less than 63.59 mug/ml. considering the bioactive potential of eos and 7-hydroxycalamenene could be of great interest for development of antimicrobials for therapeutic use in treatment of bacterial and fungal infections in humans and/or veterinary practice.

TI  == american journal of gastroenterology lecture: intestinal microbiota and the role  of fecal microbiota transplant (fmt) in treatment of c. difficile infection.
AB  == the vital roles that intestinal flora, now called microbiota, have in maintaining our health are being increasingly appreciated. starting with birth, exposure to the outside world begins the life-long intimate association our microbiota will have with our diet and environment, and initiates determination of the post-natal structural and functional maturation of the gut. moreover, vital interactions of  the microbiota with our metabolic activities, as well as with the immunological apparatus that constitutes our major defense system against foreign antigens continues throughout life. a perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated  with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases including clostridium difficile infection (cdi). it has become recognized that fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic cdi, and effect a seemingly safe, relatively inexpensive, and rapidly effective cure in the vast majority of patients so treated. in addition, fmt has been used to treat an array of other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, although experience in these other non-cdi diseases is in its infancy. more work needs to be done with fmt to ensure its safety and optimal route of administration. there is a conceptual sea change that is developing in our view of bacteria from their role only as pathogens to that of being critical to health maintenance in a changing world. future studies are certain to narrow the spectrum of organisms that need to be given to patients to  cure disease. fmt is but the first step in this journey.

AB  == bacterial cell division occurs in conjunction with the formation of a cytokinetic z-ring structure comprised of ftsz subunits. agents that can disrupt z-ring formation have the potential, through this unique mechanism, to be effective against several of the newly emerging multi-drug resistant strains of infectious  bacteria. 1- and 12-aryl substituted benzo[c]phenanthridines have been identified as antibacterial agents that could exert their activity by disruption of z-ring formation. substituted 4- and 5-amino-1-phenylnaphthalenes represent substructures within the pharmacophore of these benzo[c]phenanthridines. several  4- and 5-substituted 1-phenylnaphthalenes were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. the impact of select compounds on the polymerization dynamics of s. aureus ftsz was also assessed.

TI  == antibacterial and antimycotic activities of slovenian honeys.
AB  == in the present study, slovenian honey samples produced from different floral sources are evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal properties. the peroxide contribution to antibacterial activity is also determined. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the honeys was assessed against four bacterial  species (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus) and against eight fungal species (aspergillus niger, aureobasidium pullulans, candida albicans, candida parapsilosis, candida tropicalis, cladosporium cladosporioides, penicillium chrysogenum and rhodotorula mucilaginosa). honey at concentrations between 1% and 50% (v/v) were tested. although all of the bacterial species were inhibited by the different honey samples, the chestnut and pasture honeys showed the highest antibacterial activities. the antifungal activities were concentration-dependent, with five (aureobasidium pullulans, candida parapsilosis, candida tropicalis, cladosporium  cladosporioides, rhodotorula mucilaginosa) inhibited only at honey concentrations greater than 50%. the fungi aspergillus niger, candida albicans and penicillium chrysogenum were not inhibited by any of the tested honeys, even at the highest concentrations. the lowest mics seen were 2.5% (v/v) for the chestnut, fir and forest honeys against staphylococcus aureus, and 10.0% (v/v) for the chestnut and pasture honeys against cladosporium cladosporioides. the non-peroxide action of chestnut honey was tested against escherichia coli. the mic of the catalase-treated chestnut honey was 50% (v/v). the antibacterial effect of slovenian honeys is mostly due to peroxide action. these data support the concept that slovenian honeys are effective antibacterials and antifungals, and can thus  be applied for medicinal purposes.

TI  == in vitro activity of telavancin and comparators against selected groups of gram-positive cocci.
AB  == telavancin is a novel, rapidly cidal, dual-action glycopeptide. this study examined its in vitro activity against relevant gram-positive pathogens, comprising 99 meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 40 meticillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), 79 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 45 enterococcus faecalis, 60 enterococcus faecium, 40 beta-haemolytic streptococci and 60 streptococcus pneumoniae. except with vana enterococci, telavancin mics were tightly clustered and unimodal. telavancin mics for staphylococci ranged from </=0.03 mg/l to 0.5mg/l, with no shift for mrsa or mssa in relation to vancomycin mic. nevertheless, and independently of species, cons with raised vancomycin mics had reduced susceptibility to telavancin, however this was much more marked for teicoplanin. modal telavancin mics were 0.5mg/l and </=0.03 mg/l for glycopeptide-susceptible e. faecalis and e. faecium, respectively, with no rise for vanb isolates, but ranges rose to 4-16 mg/l and 1-4 mg/l for vana isolates, respectively. streptococci were consistently susceptible, with mics of </=0.06 mg/l. telavancin mics by etest agreed within 1  doubling dilution with those found previously by bsac agar dilution in 96.2% of cases, although with slight bias towards lower values. in the few cases (13/345)  where telavancin mics by etest were >/=2 doubling dilutions different from those  by agar dilution, the etest value was always lower; this effect was greater for the other antibiotics tested. telavancin had excellent activity, except against enterococci with vana, with no erosion of this activity against mrsa with raised  vancomycin mics. mics by etest were nearly always within 1 dilution of those by bsac agar dilution.

AB  == the study of bacterial virulence often requires a suitable animal model. mammalian models of infection are costly and may raise ethical issues. the use of insects as infection models provides a valuable alternative. compared to other non-vertebrate model hosts such as nematodes, insects have a relatively advanced  system of antimicrobial defenses and are thus more likely to produce information  relevant to the mammalian infection process. like mammals, insects possess a complex innate immune system(1). cells in the hemolymph are capable of phagocytosing or encapsulating microbial invaders, and humoral responses include  the inducible production of lysozyme and small antibacterial peptides(2,3). in addition, analogies are found between the epithelial cells of insect larval midguts and intestinal cells of mammalian digestive systems. finally, several basic components essential for the bacterial infection process such as cell adhesion, resistance to antimicrobial peptides, tissue degradation and adaptation to oxidative stress are likely to be important in both insects and mammals(1). thus, insects are polyvalent tools for the identification and characterization of microbial virulence factors involved in mammalian infections. larvae of the greater wax moth galleria mellonella have been shown to provide a useful insight  into the pathogenesis of a wide range of microbial infections including mammalian fungal (fusarium oxysporum, aspergillus fumigatus, candida albicans) and bacterial pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens pseudomonas aeruginosa, listeria monocytogenes or enterococcus faecalis(4-7). regardless of the bacterial species, results obtained with galleria larvae infected by direct injection through the cuticle consistently correlate with those of similar mammalian studies: bacterial strains that are attenuated in mammalian models demonstrate lower virulence in galleria, and strains causing severe human infections are also highly virulent in the galleria  model(8-11). oral infection of galleria is much less used and additional compounds, like specific toxins, are needed to reach mortality. g. mellonella larvae present several technical advantages: they are relatively large (last instar larvae before pupation are about 2 cm long and weight 250 mg), thus enabling the injection of defined doses of bacteria; they can be reared at various temperatures (20 degrees c to 30 degrees c) and infection studies can be  conducted between 15 degrees c to above 37 degrees c(12,13), allowing experiments that mimic a mammalian environment. in addition, insect rearing is easy and relatively cheap. infection of the larvae allows monitoring bacterial virulence by several means, including calculation of ld50(14), measurement of bacterial survival(15,16) and examination of the infection process(17). here, we describe the rearing of the insects, covering all life stages of g. mellonella. we provide a detailed protocol of infection by two routes of inoculation: oral and intra haemocoelic. the bacterial model used in this protocol is bacillus cereus, a gram positive pathogen implicated in gastrointestinal as well as in other severe local or systemic opportunistic infections(18,19).

TI  == environmental contamination by dog&#8217;s faeces: a public health problem?
AB  == the risk to public health from the large number of dog stools present on streets  of urban areas is cause for concern. dog faeces may be a serious hazard because they may contain microorganisms that are both pathogenic to humans and resistant  to several classes of antibiotics. the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential for zoonotic infections and for the presence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in canine faeces which contaminates the urban environment. a total of 418 canine faecal samples were collected from streets in seven areas of bari, southern italy. we have isolated multi-drug resistant enterococci and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus from these dog faecal samples. the presence of the resistant bacteria in an urban environment may represent a public health hazard which requires control measures by competent authorities. no salmonella, yersinia or campylobacter species were isolated. giardia cysts were detected in 1.9% of the samples. the predominant enterococcus species were e. faecium (61.6%), e. gallinarum (23.3%) and e. casseliflavus (5.5%). other species, including e. faecalis were also isolated. these strains were resistant to clindamycin (86.3%), tetracycline (65.7%), erythromycin (60.27%) and ampicillin (47.9%). high-level aminoglycoside resistance (hlar) was found in 65.7% of enterococci. resistance to three or more antibiotics and six or more antibiotics were observed in 67.12% and 38.4% of enterococcus spp., respectively. resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was not detected in any of the enterococcus spp. isolated. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 0.7% of the faecal samples. canine faeces left on the streets may represent a risk factor for transmission of microorganisms and a reservoir of multidrug- resistant bacteria thus contributing to the spread of resistance genes into an urban area.

TI  == effect of low-dose gaseous ozone on pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: treatment of chronically infected wounds is a challenge, and bacterial environmental contamination is a growing issue in infection control. ozone may have a role in these situations. the objective of this study was to determine whether a low dose of gaseous ozone/oxygen mixture eliminates pathogenic bacteria cultivated in petri dishes. methods: a pilot study with 6 bacterial strains was made using different concentrations of ozone in an ozone-oxygen mixture to determine a minimally effective dose that completely eliminated bacterial growth. the small and apparently bactericidal gaseous dose of 20 mug/ml ozone/oxygen (1:99) mixture, applied for 5 min under atmospheric pressure was selected. in the 2nd phase, eight bacterial strains with well characterized resistance patterns were evaluated in vitro using agar-blood in adapted petri dishes (105 bacteria/dish). the cultures were divided into 3 groups: 1--ozone-oxygen gaseous mixture containing 20 mug of o(3)/ml for 5 min; 2--100% oxygen for 5 min; 3--baseline: no gas was used. results: the selected ozone dose was applied to the following eight strains: escherichia coli, oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter baumannii susceptible only to carbapenems, and pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. all isolates were completely inhibited by the ozone-oxygen mixture while growth occurred in the other 2 groups. conclusion: a single topical application by nebulization of a low ozone dose completely inhibited the growth of all potentially pathogenic bacterial strains with known resistance to antimicrobial agents.

TI  == tissue distribution, expression, and antimicrobial activity of anas platyrhynchos avian beta-defensin 6.
AB  == in this study, a novel avian beta-defensin (avbd) was isolated from the chaohu duck. the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene contained a 204-bp open reading frame that encoded 67 amino acids (aa), including a signal peptide of 20  aa, a propiece of 5 aa, and a mature peptide of 42 aa. the homology, characterization, and comparison of this gene with avbd from other avian species  confirmed that it was duck avbd6. also, the preproprotein of avbd6 from chicken,  goose, and duck was highly conserved with 100% aa homology. the avbd6 mrna was widely expressed in the investigated tissues of healthy 5-mo-old ducks, with the  exception of the skin, kidney, and bursa. the avbd6 mrna was highly expressed in  the spleen, lung, stomach, tongue, and egg yolk, successively; moderately expressed in the bone marrow and liver; and expressed to lower degrees in the trachea, heart, intestine, muscle, esophagus, and testis. we produced recombinant avbd6 by expressing the gene in escherichia coli. the yield of soluble glutathione s-transferees (gst)-avbd6 in the inclusion bodies increased significantly as the incubation temperature was decreased from 37 to 30 degrees c. as expected, the gst-avbd6 exhibited strong bactericidal properties [minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 0.5 to 2 mum] against the aeromonas veronii biovar sobria strain bjcp-5, e. coli, and enterococcus faecalis [atcc 29212); it  possessed medium bactericidal properties (mic = 4 to 8 mum) against staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enteritidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), and bacillus subtilis (cmcc 63501;; and it possessed low bactericidal properties (mic = 16 mum) against candida albicans (atcc 10231). additionally, the antimicrobial activity of gst-avbd6 proved to be the same as that of synthetic avbd6. the a. veronii biovar sobria strain bjcp-5 cells that were treated with gst-avbd6 showed lysis and shrinkage under scanning electron microscopy. the mechanisms of avbd6-mediated killing of a. veronii biovar sobria  involved both cell lysis and nonlysis. our results indicate that avbd6 plays an important role in the innate immunity of the chaohu duck.

AB  == this study compared neo-sensitabs with oxoid paper disks using the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility test on mueller-hinton agar. the eucast-recommended  quality control strains (escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212) (part i) and clinical isolates (part ii) were investigated. in part i of the study, 27 combinations of antimicrobial agents were tested on four quality control strains repeatedly up to 60 times and zone diameters of tablets and disks were compared. in part ii of the study, 351 clinical isolates were included to cover a broad range of species, as well as resistance mechanisms. in part i, four major deviations (>1 mm outside quality control ranges) were observed with neo-sensitabs. in one case with p. aeruginosa atcc 27853 (meropenem), there was a corresponding major deviation (2 mm) with the oxoid disk. the three remaining major deviations with neo-sensitabs were observed with meropenem (2 mm) in e. coli atcc 25922 and with ciprofloxacin (2 mm) and gentamicin (3 mm) in p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. for oxoid disks, there were only minor deviations (=1 mm outside quality control ranges) in these three cases. in part ii, there were six  discrepancies, susceptible versus resistant, in 3,533 comparisons between the two methods with the clinical isolates. the rosco neo-sensitabs appear to be a possible alternative to oxoid paper disks for eucast disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing on mueller-hinton agar.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial and time-kill evaluation of the erythrina caffra thunb. extract against bacteria associated with diarrhoea.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of stem bark ethanolic extract of erythrina caffra thunb. against bacteria in diarrhoea was determined in vitro by the agar diffusion and dilution, macrobroth dilution, and time-kill assay methods. the result showed that the extract produced inhibition zones ranging between 15 +/- 1.0 mm and 23 +/- 1.0 mm, and the bacteria were susceptible at concentrations ranging between </=100 and </=1000 mug/ml. while the mics of the extract ranged between 39.1 and 625 mug/ml, and the mbcs ranged between 78.1 and 625 mug/ml, the mics of micrococcus luteus, proteus vulgaris csir 0030, enterococcus faecalis kzn, and staphylococcus aureus ok(3) were less than 100 mug/ml, and the mechanisms of antibiosis indicated that the crude ethanolic extract was highly bactericidal against the entire test bacteria isolates. in the time-kill assay, the average log reduction of the viable cell count ranged between 0.916 log(1)(0) and 1.851 log(1)(0) cfu/ml on incubating the bacteria for 4 h at the mics, while  the reduction ranged between 0.183 log(1)(0) and 1.105 log(1)(0) cfu/ml after 8 h of incubation. incubating the bacteria for 4 h at 2 x mics resulted in the reduction of the viable cell count to between -0.264 log(1)(0) and 0.961 log(1)(0) cfu/ml, while the average log reduction ranged between -3.968 log(1)(0) and -0.425 log(1)(0) cfu/ml after 8 h of incubation with micrococcus luteus, proteus vulgaris csir 0030, and staphylococcus aureus ok(3) being the most highly affected bacteria. the result showed that the extract exhibited broader-spectrum  antibacterial activity and justifies the use of erythrina caffra in the folkloric medicine for treating gastrointestinal infections in south africa.

TI  == bloodstream infections in immunocompromised hosts.
AB  == immunocompromised hosts are at high risk for bloodstream infections (bsis); the outcome is unpredictable (even with adequate therapy), frequently severe (mortality 27%). a 26 months survey in a haematology/oncology hospital was set-up; it comprised 158 patients and detected 171 positive blood cultures. the origin of the infections was primitive in 27.22% and secondary in 72.78% of the cases; the most frequent cause was the presence of a vascular catheter (23.41%).  the second most important cause were the respiratory infections (19.62%), followed by the urinary tract infections (utis) (11.39%). gram negative bacilli represented 59.4%, the enterobacteriaceae were predominant (35.59%), followed by  pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.73%) and species like serratia marcescens and acinetobacter baumannii. although isolated at low level, they worry by an increasing frequency. among gram positive cocci (43.51%) coagulase negative staphylococci (cons) were the most frequent (25.42%), followed by staphylococcus  aureus (18.08%); enterococcus faecalis (5.65%) was isolated from polymicrobial (associated) infections. the strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa  were constantly susceptible to carbapenems, demonstrating otherwise various susceptibility patterns, generally elevated to the antibiotics we tested. the production of extended spectrum betalactamase (esbl) was 22.58%. the methicillin  resistance was 54.4% in s. aureus strains; the susceptibility was variable among  7 other antibiotics tested. one staphylococcus strain had reduced susceptibility  to vancomycin. a multidisciplinary survey is necessary for the control of the multidrug resistant organisms (mdro).

TI  == twenty-five years of shared life with vancomycin-resistant enterococci: is it time to divorce?
AB  == twenty-five years ago, isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vrem) was reported both in the uk and in france. since then, vrem has spread worldwide in hospitals. hospital outbreaks appeared to be related to the evolution since the end of 1980s of a subpopulation of e. faecium highly resistant to ampicillin and fluoroquinolones (the so-called clonal complex cc17)  that later acquired resistance to vancomycin. cc17 isolates are presumably better adapted than other e. faecium isolates to the constraints of the hospital environment and most contain mobile genetic elements, phage genes, genes encoding membrane proteins, regulatory genes, a putative pathogenicity island and megaplasmids. colonization and persistence are major features of vrem. inherent characteristics of e. faecium including a remarkable genome plasticity, in part due to acquisition of is elements, in particular is16, have facilitated niche adaptation of this distinct e. faecium subpopulation that is multiply resistant to antibiotics. quinupristin/dalfopristin and linezolid are licensed for the treatment of vrem infections, with linezolid often used as a first-line treatment. however, the emergence of plasmid-mediated resistance to linezolid by  production of a cfr methyltransferase in enterococcus faecalis is worrying. daptomycin has not been extensively evaluated for the treatment of vrem infections and resistant mutants have been selected under daptomycin therapy. although control of vre is challenging, a laissez-faire policy would result in an increased number of infections and would create an irreversible situation. although so far unsuccessful, dissemination of glycopeptide-resistant staphylococcus aureus with van genes acquired from resistant enterococci cannot be ruled out.

TI  == clinical identification of bacteria in human chronic wound infections: culturing  vs. 16s ribosomal dna sequencing.
AB  == background: chronic wounds affect millions of people and cost billions of dollars in the united states each year. these wounds harbor polymicrobial biofilm communities, which can be difficult to elucidate using culturing methods. clinical molecular microbiological methods are increasingly being employed to investigate the microbiota of chronic infections, including wounds, as part of standard patient care. however, molecular testing is more sensitive than culturing, which results in markedly different results being reported to clinicians. this study compares the results of aerobic culturing and molecular testing (culture-free 16s ribosomal dna sequencing), and it examines the relative abundance score that is generated by the molecular test and the usefulness of the relative abundance score in predicting the likelihood that the same organism would be detected by culture. methods: parallel samples from 51 chronic wounds were studied using aerobic culturing and 16s dna sequencing for the identification of bacteria. results: one hundred forty-five (145) unique genera were identified using molecular methods, and 68 of these genera were aerotolerant. fourteen (14) unique genera were identified using aerobic culture methods. one-third (31/92) of the cultures were determined to be < 1% of the relative abundance of the wound microbiota using molecular testing. at the genus  level, molecular testing identified 85% (78/92) of the bacteria that were identified by culture. conversely, culturing detected 15.7% (78/497) of the aerotolerant bacteria and detected 54.9% of the collective aerotolerant relative  abundance of the samples. aerotolerant bacterial genera (and individual species including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis) with higher relative abundance scores were more likely to be detected by culture as demonstrated with regression modeling. conclusion: discordance between molecular and culture testing is often observed. however, culture-free 16s ribosomal dna sequencing and its relative abundance score can provide clinicians with insight into which bacteria are most abundant in a sample and which are most likely to be detected by culture.

TI  == rapid identification of gram-positive pathogens and their resistance genes from positive blood culture broth using a multiplex tandem rt-pcr assay.
AB  == the early initiation of targeted antibiotic therapy in patients with bacteraemia  and septic shock impacts favourably on outcomes. rapid methods are therefore increasingly employed for bacterial identification directly from positive blood culture bottles, but with variable success. we evaluated the performance of the gram positive 12 multiplex tandem pcr (mt-pcr) assay (ausdiagnostics; catalogue no. 6202, version 07) containing targets for the identification of staphylococci  including staphylococcus aureus, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci including enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and their common antibiotic resistance genes (meca, vana, vanb). a total of 673 aerobic and anaerobic blood culture broths demonstrating gram-positive cocci on microscopy were analysed in parallel with traditional phenotypic methods. amplification of the internal control was inhibited in 79/673 (11.7 %) samples; however, mt-pcr identification was in concordance with phenotypic identification to the genus level in 96.6 % (537/556) of the remaining monomicrobial specimens and to the species level, where applicable, in 100 % (172/172) of samples. mt-pcr identification for 94.7 % (36/38) of polymicrobial samples matched traditional phenotypic identification. meticillin and vancomycin susceptibility results determined by mt-pcr in blood culture broths demonstrated complete agreement with those determined by phenotypic methods in all 143 staphylococcus aureus isolates  and eight e. faecium isolates, respectively. gram-positive pathogens and their key antibiotic resistance markers were reliably identified with the mt-pcr assay  within 3 h of a positive blood culture result.

TI  == 3-phenyl substituted 6,7-dimethoxyisoquinoline derivatives as ftsz-targeting antibacterial agents.
AB  == the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has created an urgent need for antibiotics with a novel mechanism of action. the bacterial cell division protein ftsz is an attractive target for the development of novel antibiotics. the benzo[c]phenanthridinium sanguinarine and the dibenzo[a,g]quinolizin-7-ium berberine are two structurally similar plant alkaloids that alter ftsz function.  the presence of a hydrophobic functionality at either the 1-position of 5-methylbenzo[c]phenanthridinium derivatives or the 2-position of dibenzo[a,g]quinolizin-7-ium derivatives is associated with significantly enhanced antibacterial activity. 3-phenylisoquinoline represents a subunit within the ring-systems of both of these alkaloids. several 3-phenylisoquinolines and 3-phenylisoquinolinium derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, including multidrug-resistant strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis (vre). a number of derivatives were found to have activity against both mrsa and vre. the binding of select compounds to s. aureus ftsz (saftsz) was demonstrated and characterized using fluorescence spectroscopy. in addition, the compounds were shown to act as stabilizers of saftsz polymers and concomitant inhibitors of saftsz gtpase activity. toxicological assessment of select compounds revealed minimal cross-reaction mammalian beta-tubulin as well as little or no human cytotoxicity.

TI  == molecular structure, normal coordinate analysis, harmonic vibrational frequencies, natural bond orbital, td-dft calculations and biological activity analysis of antioxidant drug 7-hydroxycoumarin.
AB  == in this work, we report harmonic vibrational frequencies, molecular structure, nbo and homo, lumo analysis of umbelliferone also known as 7-hydroxycoumarin (7hc). the optimized geometric bond lengths and bond angles obtained by computation (monomer and dimmer) shows good agreement with experimental xrd data. harmonic frequencies of 7hc were determined and analyzed by dft utilizing 6-311+g(d,p) as basis set. the assignments of the vibrational spectra have been carried out with the help of normal coordinate analysis (nca) following the scaled quantum mechanical force field methodology (sqmff). the change in electron density (ed) in the sigma* and pi* antibonding orbitals and stabilization energies e(2) have been calculated by natural bond orbital (nbo) analysis to give clear evidence of stabilization originating in the hyperconjugation of hydrogen-bonded interaction. the energy and oscillator strength calculated by time-dependent density functional theory (td-dft) complements with the experimental findings. the simulated spectra satisfactorily coincides with the experimental spectra. microbial activity of studied compounds was tested against  staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, psuedomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, shigella  flexneri, salmonella typhi and enterococcus faecalis.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == psk41-like plasmid is necessary for inc18-like vana plasmid transfer from enterococcus faecalis to staphylococcus aureus in vitro.
AB  == vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa) is thought to result from the in vivo conjugative transfer of a vana plasmid from an enterococcus sp. to s. aureus. we studied bacterial isolates from vrsa cases that occurred in the united states to identify microbiological factors which may contribute to this plasmid transfer. first, vancomycin-susceptible, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) isolates from five vrsa cases were tested for their ability to accept foreign dna by conjugation in mating experiments with enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 containing  pam378, a pheromone-response conjugative plasmid. all of the mrsa isolates accepted the plasmid dna with similar transfer efficiencies ( approximately 10(-7)/donor cfu) except for one isolate, mrsa8, for which conjugation was not successful. the mrsa isolates were also tested as recipients in mating experiments between an e. faecalis isolate with an inc18-like vana plasmid that was isolated from a vrsa case patient. conjugative transfer was successful for 3/5 mrsa isolates. successful mrsa recipients carried a psk41-like plasmid, a staphylococcal conjugative plasmid, whereas the two unsuccessful mrsa recipients  did not carry psk41. the transfer of a psk41-like plasmid from a successful mrsa  recipient to the two unsuccessful recipients resulted in conjugal transfer of the inc18-like vana plasmid from e. faecalis at a frequency of 10(-7)/recipient cfu.  in addition, conjugal transfer could be achieved for psk41-negative mrsa in the presence of a cell-free culture filtrate from s. aureus carrying a psk41-like plasmid at a frequency of 10(-8)/recipient cfu. these results indicated that a psk41-like plasmid can facilitate the transfer of an inc18-like vana plasmid from e. faecalis to s. aureus, possibly via an extracellular factor produced by psk41-carrying isolates.

TI  == human serum albumin stabilized gold nanoclusters as selective luminescent probes  for staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == in this work, human serum albumin (hsa) stabilized gold nanoclusters (hsa-auncs)  with reddish photoluminescence were used as sensing probes for pathogenic bacteria including enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli j96, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (pdrab), staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), streptococcus pyogenes, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre). we discovered that hsa-auncs have unique affinity with s. aureus and mrsa. in addition to demonstrating the selective sensing ability of hsa-auncs toward s. aureus and mrsa, the binding peptide motifs identified from hsa-auncs were characterized by mass spectrometry. the identified binding peptides were further used as the reducing and stabilizing agents for generation of peptide-bound auncs (pep-auncs). the generated pep-auncs were demonstrated to have the binding affinities with s. aureus and mrsa.

AB  == antibiotic resistance has prompted efforts to discover antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action. ftsz is an essential protein for bacterial cell division, and has been viewed as an attractive target for the development of new antibiotics. sanguinarine is a benzophenanthridine alkaloid that prevents cytokinesis in bacteria by inhibiting ftsz self-assembly. in this study, a series of 5-methylbenzo[c]phenanthridinium derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. the data indicate that the presence of a 1- or 12-phenyl substituent on 2,3,8,9-tetramethoxy-5-methylbenzo[c]phenanthridinium chloride significantly enhances antibacterial activity relative to the parent compound or sanguinarine.

TI  == species-level analysis of dna sequence data from the nih human microbiome project.
AB  == background: outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections emphasize the  importance of surveillance of potentially pathogenic bacteria. genomic sequencing of clinical microbiological specimens expands our capacity to study cultivable, fastidious and uncultivable members of the bacterial community. herein, we compared the primary data collected by the nih's human microbiome project (hmp) with published epidemiological surveillance data of staphylococcus aureus. methods: the hmp's initial dataset contained microbial survey data from five body regions (skin, nares, oral cavity, gut and vagina) of 242 healthy volunteers. a significant component of the hmp dataset was deep sequencing of the 16s ribosomal rna gene, which contains variable regions enabling taxonomic classification. since species-level identification is essential in clinical microbiology, we built a reference database and used phylogenetic placement followed by most recent common ancestor classification to look at the species distribution for staphylococcus, klebsiella and enterococcus. main results: we show that selecting the accurate region of the 16s rrna gene to sequence is analogous to carefully selecting culture conditions to distinguish closely related bacterial species. analysis of the hmp data showed that staphylococcus aureus was present in the nares of 36% of healthy volunteers, consistent with culture-based epidemiological data. klebsiella pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis were found less frequently, but across many habitats. conclusions: this work demonstrates that large 16s rrna survey studies can be used to support epidemiological goals in the context of an  increasing awareness that microbes flourish and compete within a larger bacterial community. this study demonstrates how genomic techniques and information could be critically important to trace microbial evolution and implement hospital infection control.

TI  == comparative genomics of community-acquired st59 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in taiwan: novel mobile resistance structures with is1216v.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) with st59/sccmecv and panton-valentine leukocidin gene is a major community-acquired mrsa (ca-mrsa) lineage in taiwan and has been multidrug-resistant since its initial isolation. in this study, we studied the acquisition mechanism of multidrug resistance in an st59 ca-mrsa strain (pm1) by comparative genomics. pm1's non-beta-lactam resistance was encoded by two unique genetic traits. one was a 21,832-bp composite mobile element structure (mes(pm1)), which was flanked by direct repeats of enterococcal is1216v and was inserted into the chromosomal sask gene;  the target sequence (att) was 8 bp long and was duplicated at both ends of mes(pm1). mes(pm1) consisted of two regions: the 5'-end side 12.4-kb region carrying tn551 (with ermb) and tn5405-like (with aph[3']-iiia and aade), similar  to an enterococcus faecalis plasmid, and the 3'-end side 6,587-bp region (mes(cat)) that carries cat and is flanked by inverted repeats of is1216v. mes(cat) possessed att duplication at both ends and additional two copies of is1216v inside. mes(pm1) represents the first enterococcal is1216v-mediated composite transposon emerged in mrsa. is1216v-mediated deletion likely occurred in is1216v-rich mes(pm1), resulting in distinct resistance patterns in pm1-derivative strains. another structure was a 6,025-bp tet-carrying element (mes(tet)) on a 25,961-bp novel mosaic penicillinase plasmid (ppm1); mes(tet) was flanked by direct repeats of is431, but with no target sequence repeats. moreover, the pm1 genome was deficient in a copy of the restriction and modification genes (hsdm and hsds), which might have contributed to the acquisition of enterococcal multidrug resistance.

TI  == epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis: a case-case-control study.
AB  == although much is known about vancomycin-resistant (vr) enterococcus faecium, little is known about the epidemiology of vr enterococcus faecalis. the predilection of vr e. faecalis to transfer the vancomycin resistance determinant  to staphylococcus aureus is much greater than that of vr e. faecium. the epidemiology of vr e. faecalis has important implications regarding the emergence of vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa); 8 of 13 reported vrsa cases have been from michigan. a retrospective case-case-control study was conducted at the detroit medical center, located in southeastern michigan. unique patients with vr e. faecalis infection were matched to patients with strains of vancomycin-susceptible (vs) e. faecalis and to uninfected controls at a 1:1:1 ratio. five hundred thirty-two vr e. faecalis cases were identified and were matched to 532 vs e. faecalis cases and 532 uninfected controls. the overall mean age of the study cohort (n = 1,596) was 63.0 +/- 17.4 years, and 747 (46.8%) individuals were male. independent predictors for the isolation of vr e. faecalis (but not vs e. faecalis) compared to uninfected controls were an age of >/=65 years, nonhome residence, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, exposure to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in the prior 3 months, and immunosuppressive status. invasive procedures and/or surgery, chronic skin ulcers, and indwelling devices were risk factors for both vr e. faecalis and vs e. faecalis isolation. cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone exposures were unique, independent predictors for isolation of vr e. faecalis. a majority of case patients had vr e. faecalis present at the time of admission. control of vr e. faecalis, and ultimately vrsa, will likely require regional efforts focusing on infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship.

AB  == we investigated bacteraemia trends for five major bacterial pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and determined how expanding antimicrobial resistance influenced the total burden of bacteraemias in europe. aetiological fractions of species and antibiotic phenotypes were extracted from the european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system (earss) database for laboratories, which consistently reported between 2002 and 2008. trend analyses used generalized linear models. robustness of results was assessed by iterative analysis for different geographic regions. from 2002 to 2008, the overall number  of reports increased annually by 6.4% (95% confidence interval (ci) 6.2-6.5%), from 46 095 to 67 876. in the subset of laboratories providing denominator information, the overall incidence increased from 0.58/1000 patient-days to 0.90/1000 patient-days (7.2% per year; 95% ci 6.9-7.5%). the frequency of reported bacteraemia isolates of s. aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae increased moderately, while increase in e. coli and enterococcus faecium was more pronounced. bacteraemias caused by methicillin-resistant s. aureus increased until 2005 (7.6% per year; 95% ci 6.1-9.1%), and then decreased (-4.8% per year;  95% ci -6.1 to -3.5%), whereas the number attributable to methicillin-sensitive s. aureus increased continuously (3.4% per year; 95% ci 3.0-3.7). increasing rates of e. coli were mainly caused by antibiotic-resistant phenotypes. our data  suggest that the burden of bacterial bloodstream infection has been increasing for all species during earss surveillance. trends were mainly driven by resistant strains and clearly dissociated between resistant and susceptible isolates. it appears that infections with resistant clones add to rather than replace infections caused by susceptible bacteria. as a consequence, expansion of antibiotic resistance creates an additional strain on healthcare systems.

AB  == objective: although major impairment of activity at lower ph values has been reported for fluoroquinolones, acidification is a widely recommended practice for the prophylaxis and treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (utis). until now, there is little evidence for the influence of ph on the activity on other antimicrobial classes in urine. methods: bacterial growth curves of staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), klebsiella oxytoca (atcc 700324), proteus mirabilis (atcc 14153), escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212) were performed in mueller-hinton broth and in pooled human urine with a ph of between 5.0 and 8.0. bacterial killing of trimethoprim, fosfomycin,  amikacin, colistin and ertapenem against the five strains (where appropriate) was determined consecutively at concentrations equal to the mic. results: while no difference in the bacterial growth of e. coli, s. aureus, p. mirabilis and k. oxytoca was observed at different ph values, bacterial growth of e. faecalis was  significantly reduced at low ph. acidification to ph 5 impaired the antimicrobial activity of all investigated antibiotics, i.e. the net effect of bacterial growth and killing resulted in increased colony-forming units/ml at the end of the experiment. conclusion: the present in vitro findings indicate that acidification of urine during the treatment of utis should be carefully considered. while growth curves of one strain supports the concept of therapeutic or prophylactic acidification during utis, the most common pathogen, e. coli, was not affected by low ph. independent of the investigated strain or antibiotic, ph values below 6 lead to a reduction of antimicrobial activity.

AB  == the antibacterial mechanisms of rhodomyrtone, a member of the acylphloroglucinols isolated from rhodomyrtus tomentosa leaves, against important hospital-acquired antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria were assessed. the results indicated that rhodomyrtone exhibited pronounced antibacterial activity against key antibiotic-resistant pathogens including epidemic meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (emrsa), vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcal strains. the strains emrsa-16, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 and vre-3 demonstrated a significant decrease in survival ability after treatment with rhodomyrtone at 1x (0.5 microg ml(-1)), 2x, 4x and 8x mic for 24 h. moreover, the compound was observed in the cytoplasmic fraction  of rhodomyrtone-treated s. aureus, and only a very fine band of the compound was  seen following separation of the cell-wall and cell-membrane fractions of the treated cells. in addition, exposure of s. aureus to rhodomyrtone at 4x, 2x and 1x mic for 24 h produced no significant effect on the bacterial cell membrane and cell lysis, suggesting that neither of these is the main target of rhodomyrtone action in these organisms. stepwise isolation of the bacterial cells with increasing resistance to rhodomyrtone was not induced in either s. aureus or emrsa-16 after 45 passages on luria-bertani agar supplemented with rhodomyrtone.  in addition, in vitro toxicity of rhodomyrtone at 128x mic on human erythrocytes  was not observed. these results provide evidence to support therapeutic challenges of rhodomyrtone against gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == synergistic bactericidal activity between hyperosmotic stress and membrane-disrupting nanoemulsions.
AB  == there is a clear clinical need for alternative types of non-antibiotic biocides due to the rising global health concern of microbial drug resistance. in this work, a novel antibacterial concept was delineated that utilized hyperosmotic stress (h) in concert with membrane-disrupting nanoemulsions (nes). the antibacterial effects of either h or a ne, as well as in combination (h+ne), were assessed in vitro using an escherichia coli model. it was found that exposure to  h or ne alone produced dose-dependent bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects, respectively. however, the bactericidal action of ne was significantly amplified  in the presence of h. outcomes following h+ne exposure included rapid efflux of k(+) and nucleic acids, increased membrane permeability and a reduction in both intracellular atp and cell viability. further inspection of morphology by electron microscopy highlighted cell shrinkage, membrane dissolution and bacteriolysis. pathogen inactivation occurred immediately upon contact with h+ne. the effects of h, ne and h+ne against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and meticillin-resistant s. aureus isolates were also examined. similar to the escherichia coli model, h+ne showed antibacterial synergism in these organisms when classified by the chou-talalay combination index for two-agent interactions. this synergistic interaction suggests that the h+ne platform may potentially serve as a new paradigm in disinfectants, antiseptics and antibacterial wound dressings. the h+ne mechanism of action was termed osmopermeation, as a descriptor for the underlying inactivation process.

(apiaceae) was investigated. the monoterpene alpha-pinene was predominant in the volatile oil from aerial parts (57.4%) and fruit (23.3%). in the essential oil of the aerial parts limonene (6.7%), camphene (5.8%) and sabinene (5.5%) were also present in high amounts, and in the fruit oil, beta-phellandrene (17.4%) and sabinene (12.9%). on the contrary, the root essential oil was composed almost entirely of the polyacetylene falcarinol (88.8%). the antimicrobial activity of the root essential oil was significant against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus luteus and enterococcus faecalis (mics 6.25-25.00 microg/ml). volatile constituents from the root strongly inhibited the growth of methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus (mics 6.25-50.00 microg/ml). anti-staphylococcal activity can be attributed to the main volatile constituent ofs. rigidum root, falcarinol.

TI  == structural and functional characterization of vang d-ala:d-ser ligase associated  with vancomycin resistance in enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == d-alanyl:d-lactate (d-ala:d-lac) and d-alanyl:d-serine ligases are key enzymes in vancomycin resistance of gram-positive cocci. they catalyze a critical step in the synthesis of modified peptidoglycan precursors that are low binding affinity  targets for vancomycin. the structure of the d-ala:d-lac ligase vana led to the understanding of the molecular basis for its specificity, but that of d-ala:d-ser ligases had not been determined. we have investigated the enzymatic kinetics of the d-ala:d-ser ligase vang from enterococcus faecalis and solved its crystal structure in complex with adp. the overall structure of vang is similar to that of vana but has significant differences mainly in the n-terminal and central domains. based on reported mutagenesis data and comparison of the vang and vana structures, we show that residues asp-243, phe-252, and arg-324 are molecular determinants for d-ser selectivity. these residues are conserved in both enzymes  and explain why vana also displays d-ala:d-ser ligase activity, albeit with low catalytic efficiency in comparison with vang. these observations suggest that d-ala:d-lac and d-ala:d-ser enzymes have evolved from a common ancestral d-ala:d-x ligase. the crystal structure of vang showed an unusual interaction between two dimers involving residues of the omega loop that are deeply anchored  in the active site. we constructed an octapeptide mimicking the omega loop and found that it selectively inhibits vang and vana but not staphylococcus aureus d-ala:d-ala ligase. this study provides additional insight into the molecular evolution of d-ala:d-x ligases and could contribute to the development of new structure-based inhibitors of vancomycin resistance enzymes.

TI  == carnosic acid is an efflux pumps modulator by dissipation of the membrane potential in enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotics has become a serious problem of public health. along with the controlled permeability by the cell-wall, active efflux systems can provide resistance by extruding antibiotics. carnosic acid is capable to potentiate the antimicrobial activity of several antibiotics. however, the underlying molecular mechanism governing this effect remains unclear. the present study aims to investigate the effect of carnosic acid on the transport of ethidium bromide, on the permeability or the membrane potential in enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. by using fluorimetric assays it was demonstrated that in e. faecalis, carnosic acid is a modulator of the uptake and  efflux of ethidium bromide which does not induce cell membrane permeabilization phenomena. such effect was sensitive to the inhibition caused by both the proton-motive force carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and the calcium antagonist verapamil, but not to vanadate, an atpase inhibitor. in this work it was demonstrated, for the first time, that the activity of carnosic acid on the uptake/efflux of ethidium bromide is correlated with its capacity to change the membrane potential gradient in s. aureus and e. faecalis. in conclusion, carnosic acid is a natural compound, structurally unrelated to known antibiotics, which can function as an efflux pump modulator by dissipation of the membrane potential. therefore, carnosic acid would be a good candidate to be employed as a novel therapeutic agent to be used in combination therapies against drug-resistant enterococci and s. aureus infections.

AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial properties of fifteen  selected strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. in vitro antibacterial activity was initially investigated by an agar spot method. results from the agar spot test showed that most of the selected strains were able to produce active compounds on solid media with antagonistic properties against salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium difficile. these results were also confirmed when cell-free culture supernatants (cfcs) from the putative probiotics were used in an agar well diffusion assay. neutralization of  the culture supernatants with alkali reduced the antagonistic effects. these experiments are able to confirm the capacity of potential probiotics to inhibit selected pathogens. one of the main inhibitory mechanisms may result from the production of organic acids from glucose fermentation and consequent lowering of  culture ph. this observation was confirmed when the profile of organic acids was  analysed demonstrating that lactic and acetic acid were the principal end products of probiotic metabolism. furthermore, the assessment of the haemolytic activity and the susceptibility of the strains to the most commonly used antimicrobials, considered as basic safety aspects, were also studied. the observed antimicrobial activity was mainly genus-specific, additionally significant differences could be observed among species.

AB  == background: filamentous fungi are well known for their production of substances with antimicrobial activities, several of which have formed the basis for the development of new clinically important antimicrobial agents. recently, environments polluted with extraordinarily high levels of antibiotics have been documented, leading to strong selection pressure on local sentinel bacterial communities. in such microbial ecosystems, where multidrug-resistant bacteria are likely to thrive, it is possible that certain fungal antibiotics have become less efficient, thus encouraging alternative strategies for fungi to compete with bacteria. methods: in this study, sediment of a highly antibiotic-contaminated indian river was sampled in order to investigate the presence of cultivable filamentous fungi and their ability to produce substances with antimicrobial activity. results: sixty one strains of filamentous fungi, predominantly various  aspergillus spp. were identified. the majority of the aspergillus strains displayed antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. bioassay-guided  isolation of the secondary metabolites of a. fumigatus led to the identification  of gliotoxin. conclusion: this study demonstrated proof of principle of using bioassay-guided isolation for finding bioactive molecules.

TI  == antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI  == possible ecological role of pseudopterosins g and p-u and seco-pseudopterosins j  and k from the gorgonian pseudopterogorgia elisabethae from providencia island (sw caribbean) in regulating microbial surface communities.
AB  == the gorgonian pseudopterogorgia elisabethae collected at providencia island (colombia) has an unfouled surface, free of obvious algal and invertebrate growth. this gorgonian produces significant amounts of the glycosilated diterpenes pseudopterosins and seco-pseudopterosins (ps and seco-ps). our previous experiments have shown activity of these compounds against eukaryotic (human cancer cell lines and candida albicans) and prokaryotic cells (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis). however, the potential role of pseudopterosins on the regulation of the fouling process is still under study. we evaluated the activity of these compounds against bacteria isolated from heavily  fouled marine surfaces as an indicator of antifouling activity. additionally, we  assessed their activity against bacteria isolated from p. elisabethae to determine whether potentially they play a role in preventing surface bacterial colonization, thus impairing presumptively the establishment of further successional stages of fouling communities. results showed that ps and seco-ps seem to modulate bacterial growth (controlling gram-positive bacterial growth and inducing gram-negative bacterial associations). we thus hypothesized that ps and  seco-ps may play a role in controlling microbial fouling communities on the surface of this gorgonian. by using btefap and fish we showed that the most abundant bacteria present in the microbial communities associated with p. elisabethae are gram-negative bacteria, with proteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria the most representative. to evaluate whether ps and seco-ps have a direct effect on the structure of the bacterial community associated with  p. elisabethae, we tested these compounds against culturable bacteria associated  with the surface of p. elisabethae, finding remarkable selectivity against gram-positive bacteria. the evidence presented here suggests that ps and seco-ps  might have a role in the selection of organisms associated with the gorgonian surface and in the regulation of the associated bacterial community composition.

AB  == ethnopharmacological importance: many bauhinia species, including those indigenous to south africa, are used in traditional medicine across the world for treating ailments such as gastrointestinal tract (git) disorders, diabetes, infectious diseases and inflammation. aims: several relevant aspects of different fractions of leaf extracts of bauhinia bowkeri (bab), bauhinia galpinii (bag), bauhinia petersiana (bap), and bauhinia variegata (bav) used in south african traditional medicine to alleviate diarrhoea related symptoms were evaluated. materials and methods: the antioxidative activities of the extracts were determined using the 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph), 2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (abts(+)) radical scavenging and ferric  reducing antioxidant power (frap) methods. in vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts were determined against bacterial strains (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis) and clinical  isolates of the opportunistic fungal strains (aspergillus fumigatus, candida albicans, and cryptococcus neoformans) using a serial dilution microplate method. the polyphenolic contents were quantified using standard methods, and anti-inflammatory activities of the crude extracts were determined using the cyclooxygenase and soybean 15-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitory assays. the safety of the extracts was evaluated by determining the cytotoxicity against vero cell lines. results: the acidified 70% acetone crude extract and their fractions had good antiradical potency against the dpph and abts radicals. the methanol soluble portions of the butanol fractions were more potent (ec(50) ranges from 0.64 +/- 0.05 to 1.51 +/- 0.07 and 0.88 +/- 0.18 to 1.49 +/- 0.09 mug/ml against dpph and  abts radical respectively) compared to the standard, trolox and ascorbic acid (ec(50) ranges from 1.47 +/- 0.24 to 1.70 +/- 0.27 mug/ml) for both dpph and abts. the crude extracts contained variable quantities of phenolic content. the crude extracts and their fractions had weak to good antimicrobial activities, inhibiting the growth of the organisms at concentrations ranging from 39 to 2500  mug/ml. the bag crude extract and its fractions were the most active against the  fungi (mics ranging from 39 to 625 mug/ml) while the bab extract and its fractions were the least active with the mics ranging between 39 and 2500 mug/ml. aspergillus fumigatus was the least susceptible fungus while cryptococcus neoformans was the most susceptible. the phenolic-rich crude extracts of bab, bag, and bap had moderate to good dose-dependent cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme inhibitory activity with inhibitions between 22.8% and 71.4%. the extracts were however, inactive against cyclooxygenase-2. the extracts had some level of cytotoxicity towards vero cell lines, reducing cell viability to less than 10% at concentrations more than 50 mug/ml. conclusion: the biological activities observed in bauhinia species provide a scientific basis for the use of the plants in traditional medicines to treat diseases with multi-factorial pathogenesis such as diarrhoea, with each aspect of activity contributing to the ultimate therapeutic benefit of the plants. however, the use of the phenolic-rich extracts of these plants to treat diarrhoea or any other ailments in traditional medicine  needs to be monitored closely because of potential toxic effects and selective inhibition of cox-1 with the associated git injury.

TI  == targeted protein engineering provides insights into binding mechanism and affinities of bacterial collagen adhesins.
AB  == the collagen-binding bacterial proteins, ace and cna, are well characterized on the biochemical and structural level. despite overall structural similarity, recombinant forms of the ace and cna ligand-binding domains exhibit significantly different affinities and binding kinetics for collagen type i (ci) in vitro. in this study, we sought to understand, in submolecular detail, the bases for these  differences. using a structure-based approach, we engineered cna and ace variants by altering specific structural elements within the ligand-binding domains. surface plasmon resonance-based binding analysis demonstrated that mutations that are predicted to alter the orientation of the ace and cna n(1) and n(2) subdomains significantly affect the interaction between the mscramm (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecule) and ci in vitro, including affinity, association/dissociation rates and binding ratio. moreover, we utilized this information to engineer an ace variant with an 11,000-fold higher ci affinity than the parent protein. finally, we noted that several engineered proteins that exhibited a weak interaction with ci recognized more sites on ci, suggesting an inverse correlation between affinity and specificity.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == standardization of isothermal microcalorimetry in urinary tract infection detection by using artificial urine.
AB  == purpose: isothermal microcalorimetry (imc) has recently been reported as a new method to rapidly detect urinary tract pathogens (utp). however, further application of microcalorimetry in the clinical setting requires a standardized procedure. an important step toward such standardization is to use a reproducible growth medium. in this study, we investigated the potential of artificial urine in combination with microcalorimetry for detection of common utp. methods: a microcalorimeter equipped with 48 channels was used. detection was accomplished,  and growth was monitored for four bacterial strains in artificial urine at 37 degrees c by measuring metabolic heat flow (muw = muj/s) as a function of time. the strains were escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, and  staphylococcus aureus. result: bacterial growth was detected after 3-32 h with decreasing inoculums down to 1 cfu. the gram-negative strains grew and were detected faster than their gram-positive counterparts. the growth rates the different strains were 0.75 +/- 0.11 for e. coli, 0.74 +/- 0.10 for e. faecalis,  1.31 +/- 0.04 for p. mirabilis, and 0.56 +/- 0.20 for s. aureus. the shape of individual heat flow curves was characteristic for each species independent of its initial concentration. conclusions: imc allows rapid detection of utp in artificial urine. clearly, different heat flow patterns enable accurate pathogen  differentiation. utp detection after only 4 h is realistic. the rapid detection of utp tested in standardized artificial urine proves the diagnostic potential of imc and warrants further microcalorimetric studies in the clinical setting of urinary tract infections.

TI  == nonculture-based identification of bacteria in milk by protein fingerprinting.
AB  == traditional methods for bacterial identification include gram staining, culturing, and biochemical assays for phenotypic characterization of the causative organism. these methods can be time-consuming because they require in vitro cultivation of the microorganisms. recently, however, it has become possible to obtain chemical profiles for lipids, peptides, and proteins that are  present in an intact organism, particularly now that new developments have been made for the efficient ionization of biomolecules. ms has therefore become the state-of-the-art technology for microorganism identification in microbiological clinical diagnosis. here, we introduce an innovative sample preparation method for nonculture-based identification of bacteria in milk. the technique detects characteristic profiles of intact proteins (mostly ribosomal) with the recently introduced maldi sepsityper(tm) kit followed by maldi-ms. in combination with a dedicated bioinformatics software tool for databank matching, the method allows for almost real-time and reliable genus and species identification. we demonstrate the sensitivity of this protocol by experimentally contaminating pasteurized and homogenized whole milk samples with bacterial loads of 10(3) -10(8) colony-forming units (cfu) of laboratory strains of escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. for milk samples contaminated with a lower bacterial load (10(4) cfu ml(-1) ), bacterial identification could be performed after initial incubation at 37 degrees c for 4 h. the sensitivity of the method may be influenced by the bacterial species and count, and therefore, it must be optimized for the specific application. the proposed use of protein markers for nonculture-based bacterial identification allows for high-throughput  detection of pathogens present in milk samples. this method could therefore be useful in the veterinary practice and in the dairy industry, such as for the diagnosis of subclinical mastitis and for the sanitary monitoring of raw and processed milk products.

TI  == use of multiparameter flow cytometry to determine the effects of monoterpenoids and phenylpropanoids on membrane polarity and permeability in staphylococci and enterococci.
AB  == monoterpenoids and phenylpropanoids are major components of many plant essential  oils and are relatively simple, low-molecular-weight compounds with antimicrobial activity. this study used multiparameter flow cytometry to examine changes in membrane polarity and permeability in staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis following exposure to the monoterpenoids carvacrol, 1,8-cineole and terpinen-4-ol and the phenylpropanoids eugenol and cinnamaldehyde. melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) essential oil was also investigated. the fluorescent dyes dioc(2)(3) (3,3'-diethyloxacarbocyanine oxide) and to-pro((r))-3 were used to assess membrane potential and permeability, respectively, following treatment with the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of each test compound for 5 min and 30 min. four subpopulations of cells were identified based on polarity and permeability. eugenol treatment resulted in the  greatest depolarisation and permeabilisation at 5 min, followed by carvacrol. cinnamaldehyde, whilst having the lowest mics (0.006-0.1%, v/v), did not induce changes in polarity or permeability at the mic, and substantially higher concentrations were required to induce significant effects. at 30 min, treatment  with all six compounds resulted in significant depolarisation (60.9-99.3% of cells), whereas fewer compounds (ranging from two to five per organism) resulted  in significant permeabilisation. the extent of permeabilisation was always less than depolarisation, with overall means for all treatments of 46.1% and 89.4% of  cells permeabilised and depolarised, respectively, at 30 min. these data demonstrate that several monoterpenoids and phenylpropanoids as well as tea tree  oil alter membrane properties by decreasing polarity and increasing permeability  in a time- and concentration-dependent manner.

TI  == volatile organic compound analysis by ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry for gram-positive bacteria differentiation.
AB  == approximately 50 % of all clinically proven infections in critically ill patients are caused by gram-positive bacteria. the timely and appropriate treatment of these infections is vital in order to avoid negative outcomes. hence, fast and reliable methods are needed for the early detection and identification of microorganisms. recently, direct mass spectrometry-based analysis of volatile organic compounds emitted by microorganisms has been employed to study gram-negative bacteria. here, we report a feasibility study of ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry (imr-ms) for in vitro growth detection and species differentiation of selected gram-positive bacteria that are frequently isolated in blood culture samples, namely, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. ion molecule reaction mass spectrometry was used to analyze the headspace above cultures containing gram-positive bacteria incubated at 37 degrees c starting with 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. measurements to determine the presence of volatile organic compounds were performed 4, 8, and 24 h after incubation, respectively. the detection of microbial growth was accomplished already after 8 h in cultures  containing e. faecalis. after 24 h of incubation, characteristic mass spectra were obtained for all species. processing these mass spectra by hierarchic clustering and principal component analysis (pca) enabled us to differentiate between bacterial species. imr-ms in conjunction with a cumulative end-point model provides the means for rapid growth detection and differentiation of gram-positive bacteria on the species level, typically within an analysis time of less than 3 min per sample.

TI  == ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  == ceftaroline fosamil is a cephalosporin antibacterial approved by the us food and  drug administration (fda) for use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (absssi) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (cabp). after intravenous administration, ceftaroline fosamil is rapidly converted to its bioactive metabolite, ceftaroline. ceftaroline has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including contemporary resistant gram-positive phenotypes, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. because of its unique spectrum of activity, the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) designated ceftaroline as a member of a new subclass of beta-lactam antimicrobials, cephalosporins with anti-mrsa activity. the activity of ceftaroline against s. aureus extends to heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates. ceftaroline has low  minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for all tested species of streptococci,  and has potent activity against s. pneumoniae isolates with varying degrees of penicillin resistance. the activity of ceftaroline is limited against enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium and against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis. the in vitro activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens, but does not extend to bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, class b metallo-beta-lactamases or ampc cephalosporinases, or to most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline  fosamil has been studied for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi) and community-acquired pneumonia (cap) in phase iii randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre noninferiority clinical trials. two identical trials (canvas 1 and canvas 2) compared the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam in 1378 adults with csssi. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 91.6% in the ceftaroline fosamil group (pooled analysis) achieving clinical response compared with 92.7% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam  group (difference -1.1%, 95% ci -4.2, 2.0). an additional analysis evaluated clinical cure in a subgroup of patients who met the fda guidance definition of absssi at treatment day 3. clinical response, defined as cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever, was 74.0% in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared  with 66.2% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (treatment difference 7.8%, 95% ci 1.3, 14.0). clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in 1240 hospitalized adults with cap was compared with that of ceftriaxone in two additional phase iii trials (focus 1 and focus 2). of note, because ceftriaxone does not have activity against mrsa, patients with confirmed or suspected mrsa cap were excluded from the focus trials. results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone, with 84.3% in the ceftaroline fosamil group achieving clinical cure  compared with 77.7% in the ceftriaxone group (difference 6.7%, 95% ci 1.6, 11.8). an additional analysis of the trials was conducted in patients with moderate to severe cap and at least one proven typical bacterial pathogen at baseline (i.e. cabp). day 4 clinical response rates were 69.5% for ceftaroline and 59.4% for ceftriaxone (difference 10.1%, 95% ci -0.6, 20.6). in the phase iii trials, adverse event rates were similar between groups. overall, ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin with excellent in vitro activity against resistant gram-positive pathogens, including mrsa, as well as many common gram-negative organisms. it is a welcome treatment option for absssi and cabp.

TI  == infected total knee arthroplasty treatment outcome analysis.
AB  == background/aim: infected total knee arthroplasty (tka) is a topic of great importance, because its diagnosing and treatment requires a lot of resources, and often has an unsatisfactory outcome. the aim of this study was to analyze the outcome of the treatment of infection developed following tka. methods: this retrospective study of infected tkas was performed in the period from 1998 to 2008 in the orthopedics & traumatology clinic of the military medical academy (mma) in belgrade. a total of 654 primary and revised tkas were performed in the  said period. we registered and surgically treated 28 infected tkas (primary tkas: mma--22, other institutions--6). the incidence of tka infection in the mma was 3.36%. the most common pathogens were: staphylococcus aureus--14 (50%) cases, and staph. epidermidis--3 (10.7%) cases. other isolated pathogens were: enterococcus  faecalis, klebsiella pneum., klebsiella spp., streptoccocus viridans, seratia spp, micrococcus luteus and peptostreptococcus spp. in one case we had mixed anaerobic flora, and in 3 cases cultures were negative. we analyzed diagnostic challenges, risk factors (such as age and previous viscosupplementation) and treatment outcomes in our series of infected tkas. results: in our series 2 infections healed after iv antibiotics and debridement, 1 patient responded to open debridement with component retention, 4 patients responded fully to one-stage reimplantation, 10 cases responded fully to two-stage reimplantation, 11 patients ended with arthrodesis and we had 1 patient withabove knee amputation. conclusion: two-stage reimplantation remains gold standard for treatment of infected tka, and we recommend it as treatment of choice for eradication of infection. the antibiotic loaded spacer prothesis concept in most  cases allows infection eradication, good function and high patient satisfaction.

TI  == nosocomial infections in a pediatric intensive care unit of a developing country: nhsn surveillance.
AB  == introduction: this study aimed to determine the epidemiology of the three most common nosocomial infections (ni), namely, sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection (uti), in a pediatric intensive care unit (picu) in a developing country and to define the risk factors associated with ni. methods: we performed  a prospective study on the incidence of ni in a single picu, between august 2009  and august 2010. active surveillance by national healthcare safety network (nhsn) was conducted in the unit and children with ni (cases) were compared with a group (matched controls) in a case-control fashion. results: we analyzed 172 patients;  22.1% had ni, 71.1% of whom acquired it in the unit. the incidence densities of sepsis, pneumonia, and uti per 1,000 patients/day were 17.9, 11.4, and 4.3, respectively. the most common agents in sepsis were enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli (18% each); staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 13% of cases. in pneumonias staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause (3.2%), and  in uti the most frequent agents were yeasts (33.3%). the presence of ni was associated with a long period of hospitalization, use of invasive devices (central venous catheter, nasogastric tube), and use of antibiotics. the last two were independent factors for ni. conclusions: the incidence of ni acquired in this unit was high and was associated with extrinsic factors.

TI  == type i and type ii mechanisms of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy: an in vitro  study on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background and objectives: antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) employs a non-toxic photosensitizer (ps) and visible light, which in the presence of oxygen produce reactive oxygen species (ros), such as singlet oxygen ((1) o(2), produced via type ii mechanism) and hydroxyl radical (ho(.), produced via type i mechanism). this study examined the relative contributions of (1) o(2) and ho(.)  to apdt killing of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. study design/materials and methods: fluorescence probes, 3'-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-fluorescein (hpf) and singlet oxygen sensor green reagent (sosg) were used to determine ho(.) and (1) o(2) produced by illumination of two  ps: tris-cationic-buckminsterfullerene (bb6) and a conjugate between polyethylenimine and chlorin(e6) (pei-ce6). dimethylthiourea is a ho(.) scavenger, while sodium azide (nan(3)) is a quencher of (1) o(2). both apdt and killing by fenton reaction (chemical generation of ho(.)) were carried out on gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). results: conjugate pei-ce6 mainly produced (1) o(2) (quenched by nan(3)), while bb6 produced ho(.) in addition to (1) o(2) when nan(3) potentiated probe activation. nan(3) also potentiated hpf activation by fenton reagent. all bacteria were killed by fenton reagent but gram-positive bacteria needed a higher concentration than gram-negatives. nan(3) potentiated fenton-mediated killing of  all bacteria. the ratio of apdt killing between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was 2 or 4:1 for bb6 and 25:1 for conjugate pei-ce6. there was a nan(3)  dose-dependent inhibition of apdt killing using both pei-ce6 and bb6 against gram-negative bacteria while nan(3) almost failed to inhibit killing of gram-positive bacteria. conclusion: azidyl radicals may be formed from nan(3) and ho(.). it may be that gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to ho(.) while  gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to (1) o(2). the differences in nan(3) inhibition may reflect differences in the extent of ps binding to bacteria (microenvironment) or differences in penetration of nan(3) into cell walls of bacteria.

TI  == in vitro activities of antimicrobial cationic peptides; melittin and nisin, alone or in combination with antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activities of two antimicrobial cationic peptides, melittin and nisin alone and in combination with frequently used antibiotics (daptomycin, vancomycin, linezolid, ampicillin, and erythromycin), were assessed against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. using the broth microdilution method, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) ranges of melittin and nisin against all strains were 2-8 mug/ml and 2-32 mug/ml respectively. in combination studies performed with the microdilution checkerboard method using a  fractional inhibitory concentration index of </= 0.5 as borderline, synergistic interactions occurred more frequently with nisin-ampicillin combination against mssa and nisin-daptomycin combination against e. faecalis strains. the results of the time-killing curve analysis demonstrated that the concentration dependent rapid bactericidal activity of nisin, and that synergism or early synergism was detected in most strains when nisin or melittin was used in combination with antibiotics even at concentrations of 0.5 x mic.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-positive pathogens in saudi arabia.
AB  == several species of gram-positive cocci are major nosocomial or community pathogens associated with morbidity and mortality. here, we review the antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens in saudi arabia. in the last decades, antimicrobial resistance has increased among staphylococcus aureus in the kingdom with a growing prevalence of both nosocomial and community methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) isolates. as yet, no vancomycin-resistant  mrsa have been reported, although isolates with reduced susceptibility to the drug have been noted. currently, the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant entrococci (vre) is low; however, vre has been described in the kingdom as well as enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium isolates with high-level resistance to penicillin, sulfamethoxazole, macrolides, tetracycline, and aminoglycosides. in recent decades, the prevalence and rate of penicillin resistance and non-susceptibility among streptococcus pneumoniae isolates have increased in saudi arabia. the organism remains, however, susceptible to other beta-lactams and to quinolones. on the other hand, resistance to co-trimoxazole and tetracyclines is high and resistance to macrolides is on the increase.

TI  == antimicrobial phenylpropanoids from the argentinean highland plant parastrephia lucida (meyen) cabrera.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: the argentinean highland plant parastrephia lucida (meyen) cabrera is used in traditional medicine as an antiseptic and anti-inflammatory crude drug. aim of the study: to relate the antimicrobial effect of the crude drug with the constituents of the active fractions and traditional use. materials and methods: assay-guided isolation of the methanol (meoh) plant extract was carried out using bacteria and yeasts as target organisms. both atcc and local strains were included in the study. the antimicrobial fractions and compounds were detected by bioautographic assays. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of each extract and fraction were determined and compared with reference antibiotics. fractions were analyzed by hplc-dad, gc-ms, (1)h nmr and (13)c nmr. results: from the meoh extract of the plant, assay-guided isolation of the antimicrobial constituents led to 12 phenylpropanoids and two simple phenolics. most of the compounds occurring in the active fractions were e-caffeoyl or e-cinnamoyl esters including prenyl and phenethyl derivatives. the mic values of the most active fractions ranged between 12.5 and 200 mug/ml against reference strains and local isolates of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. conclusions: the antimicrobial effect found in the crude drug was associated with mixtures of phenylpropanoids,  including prenyl and phenethyl esters of caffeic and cinnamic acids. the results  support at least in part the traditional use of the plant as local antiseptic.

AB  == rubus parvifolius l. (rp) is a medicinal herb that possesses antibacterial activity. in this study, we extracted the volatile oil from the leaves of rp to assess its antibacterial activity and analyze its chemical composition. a uniform distribution design was used to optimize the extraction procedure, which yielded  0.36% (w/w) of light yellowish oil from the water extract of rp leaves. we found  that the extracted oil effectively inhibited the growth of a wide range of gram positive and negative bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii, bacillus cloacae, and klebsiella pneumoniae. we further analyzed the components contained in the hydro-distillated rp volatile oil by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. twenty nine compounds were identified, including 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene (66%), 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol (10%) and 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid (2%). our results suggest that one or multiple constituents contained in rp volatile oil may account for its antibacterial activity.

TI  == antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity analysis of halistanol trisulphate from marine sponge petromica citrina.
AB  == objectives: an aqueous extract and fraction from the marine sponge petromica citrina have antibacterial activity. we performed a chemical and biological characterization of the antibiotic substance from p. citrina and investigated its mode of action on staphylococcus aureus cells. methods: the inhibitory activity of the aqueous extract of p. citrina was determined against 14 bacteria belonging to type strains and clinical antibiotic-resistant strains. the aqueous extract was fractionated under bioassay guidance and the bioactive substance was identified by its (1)h-nmr, (13)c-nmr and mass spectra. the mic and the mbc of this substance were determined. this substance was also subjected to cytotoxic bioassays. the mode of action on s. aureus cells was investigated by light and transmission electron microscopy analysis. results: p. citrina showed a large spectrum of activity against type strains and resistant-bacteria such as s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium fortuitum and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the aqueous extract was fractionated and halistanol trisulphate (24epsilon,25-dimethylcholestane-2beta,3alpha,6alpha-triol trisodium sulphate) was isolated for the first time from p. citrina. halistanol trisulphate had a bactericidal effect on exponentially growing s. aureus cells at the mic (512 mg/l). cytotoxicity biossays showed moderate toxicity against cancer cell line l929 (fibrosarcoma). this substance apparently acts by damaging the cell membrane, with subsequent cell lysis. conclusions: halistanol trisulphate is a broad-spectrum antibiotic isolated from p. citrina with a mode of action involving disruption of the cytoplasmic membrane. it is a new candidate for research on antibacterial substances.

TI  == role of mprf1 and mprf2 in the pathogenicity of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == background: enterococcus faecalis is one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections. due to its innate and acquired resistance to most antibiotics, identification of new targets for antimicrobial treatment of e. faecalis is a high priority. the multiple peptide resistance factor mprf, which was first described in staphylococcus aureus, modifies phosphatidylglycerol with lysin and  reduces the negative charge of the membrane, thus increasing resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides. we studied the effect of mprf in e. faecalis regarding influence on bacterial physiology and virulence. results: two putative  mprf paralogs (mprf1 and mprf2) were identified in e. faecalis by blast search using the well-described s. aureus gene as a lead. two deletion mutants in e. faecalis 12030 were created by homologous recombination. analysis of both mutants by thin-layer chromatography showed that inactivation of mprf2 abolishes the synthesis of three distinct amino-phosphatidylglycerols (pgs). in contrast, deletion of mprf1 did not interfere with the biosynthesis of amino-pg. inactivation of mprf2 increased susceptibility against several antimicrobial peptides and resulted in a 42% increased biofilm formation compared to wild-type  mprf. however, resistance to opsonic killing was increased in the mutant, while virulence in a mouse bacteremia model was unchanged. conclusion: our data suggest that only mprf2 is involved in the aminoacylation of pg in enterococci, and is probably responsible for synthesis of lys-pg, ala-pg, and arg-pg, while mprf1 does not seem to have a role in aminoacylation. as in other gram-positive pathogens, aminoacylation through mprf2 increases resistance against cationic antimicrobial peptides. unlike mprf found in other bacteria, mprf2 does not seem  to be a major virulence factor in enterococci.

TI  == activation of type iii interferon genes by pathogenic bacteria in infected epithelial cells and mouse placenta.
AB  == bacterial infections trigger the expression of type i and ii interferon genes but little is known about their effect on type iii interferon (ifn-lambda) genes, whose products play important roles in epithelial innate immunity against viruses. here, we studied the expression of ifn-lambda genes in cultured human epithelial cells infected with different pathogenic bacteria and in the mouse placenta infected with listeria monocytogenes. we first showed that in intestinal lovo cells, induction of ifn-lambda genes by l. monocytogenes required bacterial  entry and increased further during the bacterial intracellular phase of infection. other gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis, also induced ifn-lambda genes when internalized by lovo cells. in contrast, gram-negative bacteria salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, shigella flexneri and chlamydia trachomatis did not substantially induce ifn-lambda. we also found that ifn-lambda genes were up-regulated in a549 lung epithelial cells infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis and in hepg2 hepatocytes and bewo trophoblastic cells infected with  l. monocytogenes. in a humanized mouse line permissive to fetoplacental listeriosis, ifn-lambda2/lambda3 mrna levels were enhanced in placentas infected  with l. monocytogenes. in addition, the feto-placental tissue was responsive to ifn-lambda2. together, these results suggest that ifn-lambda may be an important  modulator of the immune response to gram-positive intracellular bacteria in epithelial tissues.

TI  == lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. however, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded  as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of gram positive pathogens, including strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. it is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting  a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.

AB  == objective: we compared differences in the hospital charges, length of hospital stay, and mortality between patients with healthcare- and community-associated bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia due to antimicrobial-resistant versus -susceptible bacterial strains. methods: a retrospective analysis of an electronic database compiled from laboratory, pharmacy, surgery, financial, and patient location and device utilization sources was undertaken on 5699 inpatients who developed healthcare- or community-associated infections between 2006 and 2008 from 4 hospitals (1 community, 1 pediatric, 2 tertiary/quaternary care) in manhattan. the main outcome measures were hospital charges, length of stay, and mortality among patients with antimicrobial-resistant and -susceptible infections caused by staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. results: controlling for multiple confounders using linear regression and nearest neighbor matching based on propensity score estimates, resistant healthcare- and community-associated infections, when compared with susceptible strains of the same organism, were associated with significantly higher charges ($15,626; confidence interval [ci], $4339-$26,913 and $25,573; ci, $9331-$41,816, respectively) and longer hospital stays for community-associated infections (3.3; ci, 1.5-5.4). patients with resistant healthcare-associated infections also had a significantly higher death rate (0.04; ci, 0.01-0.08). conclusions: with careful  matching of patients infected with the same organism, antimicrobial resistance was associated with higher charges, length of stay, and death rates. the difference in estimates after accounting for censoring for death highlight divergent social and hospital incentives in reducing patient risk for antimicrobial resistant infections.

TI  == comparison of the wst-8 colorimetric method and the clsi broth microdilution method for susceptibility testing against drug-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) obtained from the susceptibility testing of various bacteria to antibiotics were determined by a colorimetric microbial viability assay based on reduction of a tetrazolium salt {2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazoli um, monosodium salt (wst-8)} via 2-methyl-1,4-napthoquinone as an electron mediator and compared with those obtained by the broth microdilution methods approved by the clinical and laboratory standard institute (clsi). especially for drug-resistant bacteria, the clsi method at an incubation time of 24h tended to give lower mics. the extension of incubation time was necessary to obtain consistent mics for drug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococi (vre) and multi-drug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mdrp) in the broth microdilution method. there was excellent agreement between the mics determined after 24h using the wst-8 colorimetric method and those obtained after 48-96 h using the broth microdilution method. the results suggest that the wst-8 colorimetric assay is a  useful method for rapid determination of consistent mics for drug-resistant bacteria.

AB  == the emerging global epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis has created an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic approaches for disease treatment. transvalencin z (1) is a natural product from nocardia transvalensis with relatively potent and selective antimycobacterial activity against mycobacterium  smegmatis, making it an attractive target for structure-activity and mechanism of action studies. the total synthesis of the four possible diastereomers of transvalencin z was completed (1a-d), and the absolute configurations were defined using chemical synthesis, hplc retention times, and optical rotation measurements. surprisingly, none of the transvalencin z diastereomers exhibited any inhibitory activity against a panel of microbial pathogens, including several species of mycobacteria.

TI  == caenorhabditis elegans immune conditioning with the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus strain ncfm enhances gram-positive immune responses.
AB  == although the immune response of caenorhabditis elegans to microbial infections is well established, very little is known about the effects of health-promoting probiotic bacteria on evolutionarily conserved c. elegans host responses. we found that the probiotic gram-positive bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm is not harmful to c. elegans and that l. acidophilus ncfm is unable to colonize the c. elegans intestine. conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm significantly decreased the burden of a subsequent enterococcus faecalis infection in the nematode intestine and prolonged the survival of nematodes exposed to pathogenic  strains of e. faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, including multidrug-resistant (mdr) isolates. preexposure of nematodes to bacillus subtilis did not provide any beneficial effects. importantly, l. acidophilus ncfm activates key immune signaling pathways involved in c. elegans defenses against gram-positive bacteria, including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (via tir-1 and pmk-1) and the beta-catenin signaling pathway (via bar-1). interestingly, conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm had a minimal effect on gram-negative infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa or salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  and had no or a negative effect on defense genes associated with gram-negative pathogens or general stress. in conclusion, we describe a new system for the study of probiotic immune agents and our findings demonstrate that probiotic conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm modulates specific c. elegans immunity traits.

TI  == investigation of antimicrobial activity and statistical optimization of bacillus  subtilis spb1 biosurfactant production in solid-state fermentation.
AB  == during the last years, several applications of biosurfactants with medical purposes have been reported. biosurfactants are considered relevant molecules for applications in combating many diseases. however, their use is currently extremely limited due to their high cost in relation to that of chemical surfactants. use of inexpensive substrates can drastically decrease its production cost. here, twelve solid substrates were screened for the production of bacillus subtilis spb1 biosurfactant and the maximum yield was found with millet. a plackett-burman design was then used to evaluate the effects of five variables (temperature, moisture, initial ph, inoculum age, and inoculum size). statistical analyses showed that temperature, inoculum age, and moisture content  had significantly positive effect on spb1 biosurfactant production. their values  were further optimized using a central composite design and a response surface methodology. the optimal conditions of temperature, inoculum age, and moisture content obtained under the conditions of study were 37 degrees c, 14 h, and 88%,  respectively. the evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of this compound was carried out against 11 bacteria and 8 fungi. the results demonstrated that this biosurfactant exhibited an important antimicrobial activity against microorganisms with multidrug-resistant profiles. its activity was very effective against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus xylosus, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumonia, and so forth.

TI  == first study on antimicriobial activity and synergy between isothiocyanates and antibiotics against selected gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria  from clinical and animal source.
AB  == the emergence of new diseases and the resurgence of several infections that were  controlled in the past, associated with recent increase of bacterial resistance have created the necessity for more studies towards to the development of new antimicrobials and new treatment strategies. the aim of the present study was to  evaluate the in vitro synergy between different classes of important glucosinolates hydrolysis products-isothiocyanates with antibiotics (gentamycin and vancomycin), against important pathogenic bacteria: escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. a disc diffusion method was used to evaluate the antibacterial activity. the antimicrobial activity of phytochemicals and combinations between gentamycin, vancomycin and phytochemicals were quantitatively assessed by measuring the inhibitory halos. the results showed a selective antimicrobial effect of isothiocyanates, and this effect was strictly related with their chemical structure. in general the benzylisothiocyanate was the most effective compound against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus were the bacteria  most affected either by the phytochemicals alone or by the combination phytochemical-antibiotic. the bacteria pseudomonas aeruginosa was the less affected pathogen. the most important synergism detected occurred between the commercial antibiotics with benzylisothiocyanate and 2-phenylethylisothiocyanate. in conclusion, some isothiocyanates are effective inhibitors of in vitro bacterial growth, and they can act synergistically with antibiotics.

TI  == isolation and characterization of signermycin b, an antibiotic that targets the dimerization domain of histidine kinase walk.
AB  == the walk (histidine kinase)/walr (response regulator) two-component signal transduction system is a master regulatory system for cell wall metabolism and growth. this system is conserved in low g+c gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus mutans. in this study, we found the first antibiotic that functions as a walk inhibitor (signermycin b) by screening 10,000 streptomyces extracts. the chemical structure (c(23)h(35)no(4); molecular weight, 389.5) comprises a tetramic acid moiety and a decalin ring. signermycin b exhibited antimicrobial activity, with mic values ranging from 3.13 mug/ml (8 mum) to 6.25 mug/ml (16 mum) against gram-positive bacteria that possess the walk/walr two-component signal transduction system, including the drug-resistant bacteria methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of signermycin b against walk in these organisms ranged from 37 to 61 mum. to determine the mechanism of action of signermycin b, surface plasmon resonance response analysis with the two walk domains of bacillus subtilis and competition assay with atp were performed.  the results showed that signermycin b binds to the dimerization domain but not the atp-binding domain of walk. in the presence of the cross-linker glutaraldehyde, signermycin b did not cause protein aggregation but interfered with the cross-linking of walk dimers. these results suggest that signermycin b targets the conserved dimerization domain of walk to inhibit autophosphorylation. in bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, signermycin b preferentially controlled the walr regulon, thereby inhibiting cell division. these phenotypes are consistent with those of cells starved for the walk/walr system.

TI  == profile of antibiotic consumption, sensitivity and resistance in an urban area of andhra pradesh, india.
AB  == introduction: antibiotics are an important category of drugs in which indiscriminate use can affect the susceptibility patterns among infectious organisms, resulting in antibiotic resistance. methods: data on antibiotic usage  and susceptibility patterns were collected from public and private health centres in vijayawada, andhra pradesh, india, through the use of questionnaires. the data collected were then coded, tabulated, computed and evaluated using statistical analysis. results: the consumption profile of the different categories of drugs used in public and private hospitals was as follows: nutrition and metabolism products 19.0%; gastrointestinal disorder-related drugs 18.5%; antibiotics 16.8%; anti-pyretics and anti-analgesics 20.6%. these drugs were found to be in high demand. among the antibiotics, aminoglycosides (amikacin), quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin), tetracyclines (doxycycline), penicillin (ampicillin) and sulphonamides (co-trimoxazole) were the most commonly prescribed drugs for antibiotic therapy. 46% of the culture laboratory reports were positive with the  following organism profile: escherichia coli (36%), klebsiella pneumoniae (16%),  staphylococcus aureus (29%), enterococcus faecalis (9%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). in terms of the sensitivity profile of antibacterials, amikacin (66.9%) was the only antibiotic showing sensitivity patterns, while the majority  of antibiotics, such as cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, gentamycin and norfloxacin, had acquired a resistance rate of 55.1%-80.6%. conclusion: the results of this study suggest that indiscriminate prescription and consumption of new broad-spectrum antibiotics against sensitive organisms results in the development of antimicrobial resistance. therefore, there is an urgent need to curb the excessive use of antibiotics in local hospitals in order to control the  trend of increasing antimicrobial resistance to antibiotics.

TI  == transferable plasmid-mediated resistance to linezolid due to cfr in a human clinical isolate of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == nonmutational resistance to linezolid is due to the presence of cfr, which encodes a methyltransferase responsible for methylation of a2503 in the 23s rrna. the cfr gene was first described in animal isolates of staphylococci, and more recently, it has been identified in staphylococcus aureus from human clinical infections, including in an outbreak of methicillin-resistant s. aureus. in enterococci, cfr has been described in an animal isolate of enterococcus faecalis from china. here, we report an isolate of linezolid-resistant e. faecalis (603-50427x) recovered from a patient in thailand who received prolonged therapy  with the antibiotic for the treatment of atypical mycobacterial disease. the isolate lacked mutations in the genes coding for 23s rrna and l3 and l4 ribosomal proteins and belonged to the multilocus sequence type (mlst) 16 (st16), which is  commonly found in enterococcal isolates from animal sources. resistance to linezolid was associated with the presence of cfr on an ~97-kb transferable plasmid. the cfr gene environment exhibited dna sequences similar to those of other cfr-carrying plasmids previously identified in staphylococci (nucleotide identity, 99 to 100%). the cfr-carrying plasmid was transferable by conjugation to a laboratory strain of e. faecalis (og1rf) but not to enterococcus faecium or  s. aureus. the cfr gene was flanked by is256-like sequences both upstream and downstream. this is the first characterization of the potential horizontal transferability of the cfr gene from a human linezolid-resistant isolate of e. faecalis.

TI  == phage endolysins with broad antimicrobial activity against enterococcus faecalis  clinical strains.
AB  == increasing antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens has drawn the attention to the potential use of bacteriophage endolysins as alternative antibacterial agents. here we have identified, characterized, and studied the lytic potential of two endolysins, lys168 and lys170, from phages infecting enterococcus faecalis. lys168 and lys170 belong to the cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases (chap) and amidase-2 protein families, respectively. lys168 is quite a unique enterococcal phage endolysin. it shares 95% amino acidic identity with the endolysin of staphylococcus aureus phage sap6, which in turn is distantly related to all known chap endolysins of s. aureus phages. lys170 seems  to be a natural chimera assembling catalytic and cell-wall-binding domains of different origin. both endolysins showed a clear preference to act against e. faecalis and they were able to lyse a high proportion of clinical isolates of this species. specifically, lys168 and lys170 lysed more than 70% and 90% of the  tested isolates, respectively, which included a panel of diverse and typed strains representative of highly prevalent clonal complexes. lys170 was active against all tested e. faecalis vre strains. the quasi specificity toward e. faecalis is discussed considering the nature of the enzymes' functional domains and the structure of the cell wall peptidoglycan.

AB  == the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of standardized extracts of baccharis incarum in 60 degrees and 80 degrees ethanol and of a phytopharmaceutical formulation obtained from them were measured. baccharis tinctures showed antimicrobial activity against clinically isolated antibiotic resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, with mic values of 40-80 microg gae/ml. both tinctures exhibited abts(+) scavenging activity with sc(50) values between 1.6 and 4.0 microg gae/ml. the tinctures were not genotoxic in the salmonella assay. for this reason, the tincture in 60 degrees ethanol was  incorporated into a topical pharmaceutical formulation (hydrogel/ carbopol(r) 934). the phytopharmaceutical formulation also showed antibacterial and antioxidant activities in the in vitro assays. the hydrogel showed microbiological, chemical, physical and functional stability during storage at room temperature. studies that measure drug release as a determination of bioavailability were also carried out using the franz diffusion cell (fc). the results demonstrated the release of two bioactive compounds (chlorogenic acid and 4',5-dihydroxy-3',3,6,7,8-pentamethoxyflavone) from the phytotherapic preparation in hplc studies of fc receptor solution. in consequence, the phytopreparation applied topically could be used to treat skin and soft tissue infection produced  by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) or enterococcus faecalis and opens new opportunities for the use of active natural ingredients in the cosmeceutical field as antiacne and antioxidant.

TI  == antibacterial activity of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens.
AB  == aims: to investigate the effect of seven wine phenolic compounds and six oenological phenolic extracts on the growth of pathogenic bacteria associated with respiratory diseases (pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sp group f, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pneumoniae). methods and results: antimicrobial activity was determined using a microdilution method and quantified as ic(50) . mor. catarrhalis was the most susceptible specie to phenolic compounds and extracts. gallic acid and ethyl gallate were the compounds that showed the greatest antimicrobial activity. regarding phenolic extracts, gse (grape seed extract) and gse-o (oligomeric-rich fraction from gse) were the ones  that displayed the strongest antimicrobial effects. conclusions: results highlight the antimicrobial properties of wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts against potential respiratory pathogens. the antimicrobial activity of wine phenolic compounds was influenced by the type of phenolic compounds. gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible than gram-positive bacteria to the action of phenolic compounds and extracts; however, the effect was species-dependent. significance and impact of study: the ability to inhibit the growth of respiratory pathogenic bacteria as shown by several wine phenolic compounds and oenological extracts warrants further investigations to explore the use of grape and wine preparations in oral hygiene.

TI  == in silico discovery and biophysical evaluation of novel 5-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)  rhodanine inhibitors of dna gyrase b.
AB  == bacterial dna gyrase is an established and validated target for the development of novel antibacterials. in our previous work, we identified a novel series of bacterial gyrase inhibitors from the class of 4-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl) thiazoles.  our ongoing effort was designated to search for synthetically more available compounds with possibility of hit to lead development. by using the virtual screening approach, new potential inhibitors were carefully selected from the focused chemical library and tested for biological activity. herein we report on  a novel class of 5-(2-hydroxybenzylidene) rhodanines as gyrase b inhibitors with  activity in low micromolar range and moderate antibacterial activity. the binding of the two most active compounds to the enzyme target was further characterised using surface plasmon resonance (spr) and differential scanning fluorimetry methods (dsf).

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria from farmed seabass dicentrarchus labrax.
AB  == the use of lactic acid bacteria (lab) in the prevention or reduction of fish diseases is receiving increasing attention. in the present study, 47 lab strains  were isolated from farmed seabass ( dicentrarchus labrax ) and were phenotypically and phylogenetically analysed by 16s rdna and randomly amplified polymorphic dna - polymerase chain reaction (rapd-pcr). their antimicrobial effect was tested in vitro against a wide variety of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. most of the strains isolated were enterococci belonging to the following species: enterococcus faecium (59%), enterococcus faecalis (21%), enterococcus sanguinicola (4 strains), enterococcus mundtii (1 strain), enterococcus pseudoavium (1 strain), and lactococcus lactis (1 strain). an aerococcus viridans strain was also isolated. the survey of their antimicrobial susceptibility showed that all isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and exhibited resistance to between 4 and 10 other antibiotics relevant for therapy in human and animal medicine. different patterns of resistance were noted for skin and intestines isolates. more than 69% (32 strains) of the isolates inhibited the growth of the majority of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria tested,  including listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, aeromonas hydrophila, aeromonas salmonicida, vibrio anguillarum, and carnobacterium sp. to our knowledge, this is the first report of bioactive enterococcal species isolated from seabass that could potentially inhibit the undesirable bacteria found in food systems.

TI  == novel chimerical endolysins with broad antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == due to their bacterial lytic action, bacteriophage endolysins have recently gained great attention as a potential alternative to antibiotics in the combat of gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, particularly those displaying multidrug resistance. however, large-scale production and purification of endolysins is frequently impaired due to their low solubility. in addition, a large number of endolysins appear to exhibit reduced lytic efficacy when compared with their action during phage infection. here, we took advantage of the high solubility of  two recently characterized enterococcal endolysins to construct chimeras targeting staphylococcus aureus. the putative cell wall binding domain of these endolysins was substituted by that of a staphylococcal endolysin that showed poor solubility. under appropriate conditions the resulting chimeras presented the high solubility of the parental enterococcal endolysins. in addition, they proved to be broadly active against a collection of the most relevant methicillin-resistant s. aureus epidemic clones and against other gram-positive pathogens. thus, fusion of endolysin domains of heterologous origin seems to be a suitable approach to design new potent endolysins with changed and/or extended lytic spectrum that are amenable to large-scale production.

TI  == action of linezolid or vancomycin on biofilms in ventriculoperitoneal shunts in vitro.
AB  == cerebrospinal fluid (csf) shunts used to treat hydrocephalus have an overall infection rate of about 10% of operations. the commonest causative bacteria are staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. major difficulties are encountered with nonsurgical treatment due to biofilm development in the shunt tubing and inability to achieve sufficiently high csf drug levels by intravenous administration. recently, three cases of s. epidermidis csf shunt infection have been treated by intravenous linezolid without surgical shunt removal, and we therefore investigated vancomycin and linezolid against biofilms of these bacteria in vitro. a continuous-perfusion model of shunt catheter biofilms was used to establish mature (1-week) biofilms of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis (both methicillin resistant  [mrsa and mrse]), enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. they were then "treated" with either vancomycin or linezolid in concentrations achievable in csf for 14 days. the biofilms were then monitored for 1 week for eradication and for  regrowth. enterococcal biofilms were not eradicated by either vancomycin or linezolid. staphylococcal biofilms were eradicated by both antibiotics after 2 days and did not regrow. no resistance was seen. linezolid at concentrations achievable by intravenous or oral administration was able to eradicate biofilms of both s. epidermidis (mrse) and s. aureus (mrsa). neither vancomycin at concentrations achievable by intrathecal administration nor linezolid was able to eradicate enterococcal biofilms. it is hoped that these in vitro results will stimulate further clinical trials with linezolid, avoiding surgical shunt removal.

TI  == [antibiotic treatment of enterococcal infections in gastroenterology with daptomycin - first experiences from the eu-core registry study (european cubicin(r) outcomes registry and experience)].
AB  == enterococci are a frequent cause of nosocomial infections in gastroenterology. the increase of enterococcus faecium infections with development of resistance to gentamicin and vancomycin as well as possible linezolid resistance require alternative antibiotic therapies. study data show that daptomycin, a highly bactericidal antibiotic is effective in enterococcal infections. however, in germany daptomycin is so far only approved for the treatment of complicated skin  and soft tissue infections, bacteremia and infective endocarditis caused by staphylococcus aureus. in the department of internal medicine i, university hospital halle (saale) from may 2 009 to april 2 010 all gastroenterological patients with evidence of invasive enterococcal infection received intravenous daptomycin treatment at inclusion in the european cubicin(r) outcomes registry and experience (eu-core). gastroenterological diseases treated were necrotising pancreatitis, infected pancreatic pseudocysts, abscesses, obstructive cholangitis and sepsis. the clinical outcome was retrospectively detected by protocol-defined criteria. a total of 13 patients (8 male, 5 female, median age 59 years) with microbiologically assured enterococcal infections (10 x e. faecium, including 1 x vre, 6 x e. faecalis, including double infections) were treated with intravenous  daptomycin (6 mg per kg body weight). in the presence of polymicrobial infections (10 of 13 patients), an additional anti-infective therapy was initiated according to sensitivity testing. concomitantly a direct focus approach with stenting, puncture or drainage was performed. the clinical cure rate was 92 % (12 of 13 patients). one patient died from a non-surgically uncontrollable malignancy (klatskin tumour bismuth iiib). there were no adverse events. these results allow us to conclude that antibiotic therapy with daptomycin in invasive or bacteraemic enterococcal infections leads to high cure rates (up to 90 % and more) when concomitant and adequate focus relief is performed. larger clinical studies to obtain an extended drug approval are desirable.

TI  == antibiotic resistance pattern of uropathogenic escherichia coli in south west nigeria.
AB  == background: various studies have indicated escherichia coli to be the most prevalent pathogen isolated in urine specimens. objectives: this study was therefore conducted to find out whether the same holds in this environment. the study will also determine the resistance pattern of uropathogenic escherichia coli isolates to available antibiotics. methods: two hundred consecutive urine samples collected from patients with clinical diagnosis of urinary tract infections (uti) and which have significant bacteriuria were included in this study. these were analysed using standard bacteriological techniques. escherichia coli isolated from the urine specimens were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing because many cases of resistance to commonly available antibiotics here have been encountered in the course of management of patients with uti. results: klebsiella species (40%) were found to be the most prevalent uropathogen in this environment, followed by e. coli (25%), staphylococcus aureus (25%), proteus species (4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%), and enterococcus faecalis (3.5%). resistance of e. coli to antibiotics commonly used in our environment for uti, namely, amoxicillin/ clavulanate, cotrimoxazole and amoxicillin were 100% each. resistance rates to other antibiotics such as ofloxacin, gentamycin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline were 70%, 92%, 96% and 88% respectively. conclusion: the high antibiotic resistance rates recorded in this study therefore calls for urgent review of existing and implementation of effective antibiotic policy in this community.

TI  == antibacterial and antimycobacterial lignans and flavonoids from larrea tridentata.
AB  == three lignans and four flavonoids were isolated and characterized from larrea tridentata and compounds were tested against 16 bacterial species/strains. results showed that: dihydroguaiaretic acid (1) had activity towards methicillin  resistant (mr) staphylococcus aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) 50 microg/ml) and multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis (mic 12.5-50 microg/ml); 4-epi-larreatricin (2) was active against enterobacter cloacae (mic 12.5 microg/ml), as well as sensitive (mic 50 microg/ml) and mdr strains of m. tuberculosis (mic 25 microg/ml). 3'-demethoxy-6-o-demethylisoguaiacin (3) displayed activity against sensitive and resistant s. aureus (mic 25 microg/ml), enterococcus faecalis (mic 12.5 microg/ml), escherichia coli (mic 50 microg/ml), e. cloacae (mic 12.5 microg/ml)  and mdr strains of m. tuberculosis (mic 12.5 microg/ml). 5,4'-dihydroxy-3,7,8,3'-tetramethoxyflavone (4) and 5,4'-dihydroxy-3,7,8-trimethoxyflavone (5) were active against m. tuberculosis mdr strains having mic values of 25 and 25-50 microg/ml, respectively, while 5,4'-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavone (6) was active against s. aureus (mic 50 microg/ml) and e. faecalis (mic 50 microg/ml). we concluded that lignan 3 is the  main compound responsible for the antibacterial activity of l. tridentata. lignans 1 and 2 as well as flavonoid 6 contribute with some degree of antibacterial activity. on the other hand, compounds 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 contributed to the antimycobacterial activity found in l. tridentata.

TI  == inhibition of candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  == xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of candida albicans. the aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. water extract from the herbaceous plant solidago virgaurea  (goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in s. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and s. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. c. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of c. albicans (four strains), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius or enterococcus faecalis. when inocula were incubated with solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in candida yeast-hyphal transition. candida biofilms were then prepared  in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm  formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. in conclusion, the s. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of c. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.

TI  == kinetics and morphology of polymicrobial biofilm formation on polypropylene mesh.
AB  == we examined the ability of three clinical bacterial isolates to form mixed biofilms on surgical polypropylene mesh (ppm) in vitro. the three strains--staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and enterobacter cloacae--were isolated from a patient with an infected ppm. staphylococcus aureus and e. faecalis (alone and in combination) were inoculated into culture containing squares of ppm and allowed to attach and propagate into mature biofilms. enterococcus faecalis initially attached to the mesh in greater numbers; however, 7 days postinoculation, there were more s. aureus cells attached, indicating that in vitro s. aureus is the out-competing species. all three isolates were then co-cultured to form mature biofilms on mesh, and the biofilms were examined by confocal microscopy using both live/dead staining and fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish). imaging revealed a dense biofilm structure with interstitial voids and channels; rods and cocci were interspersed  throughout the biofilm, indicating bacterial coexistence in close proximity. fish revealed staphylococci and enterococci adjacent to each other and also to the enterobacter, distinguishable by its rod morphology. these studies show that different species can co-operatively form mature biofilms on mesh but that the relative abundance of a species within the biofilm may vary over time.

TI  == protection against staphylococcus aureus by antibody to the polyglycerolphosphate backbone of heterologous lipoteichoic acid.
AB  == type 1 lipoteichoic acid (lta) is present in many clinically important gram-positive bacteria, including enterococci, streptococci, and staphylococci, and antibodies against lta have been shown to opsonize nonencapsulated enterococcus faecalis strains. in the present study, we show that antibodies against e. faecalis lta also bind to type 1 lta from other gram-positive species  and opsonized staphylocccus epidermidis and staphylcoccus aureus strains as well  as group b streptococci. inhibition studies using teichoic acid oligomers indicated that cross-reactive opsonic antibodies bind to the teichoic acid backbone. passive immunization with rabbit antibodies against e. faecalis lta promoted the clearance of bacteremia by e. faecalis and s. epidermidis in mice. furthermore, passive protection also reduced mortality in a murine s. aureus peritonitis model. the effectiveness of rabbit antibody against lta suggests that this conserved bacterial structure could function as a single vaccine antigen that targets multiple gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == rapid detection of urinary tract pathogens using microcalorimetry: principle, technique and first results.
AB  == what's known on the subject? and what does the study add? microcalorimetry has been applied in several microbiological studies, but never in a clinical urological context. in addition, basic knowledge on the growth of urinary pathogens in urine is still scarce and data regarding the growth rate of many urinary pathogens in urine are still not available. the study demonstrates that this innovative application of microcalorimetry is useful in (i) investigating the growth of urinary pathogens in sterilized urine and (ii) as a rapid tool for  diagnosis of urinary infection as well as for further identification of the causative infectious agent. objective: to investigate the value of isothermal microcalorimetry (imc) in the detection and differentiation of common urinary tract pathogens in urine. imc is a non-specific analytical tool for the measurement of heat in the microwatt range. patients and methods: a microcalorimeter equipped with 48 channels was used. detection was accomplished,  and growth was monitored for four bacterial strains in sterilized urine at 37 degrees c by measuring metabolic heat flow (microw = microj/s) as a function of time. the strains were escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. results: bacterial growth was detected after 3.1 to 17.1 h with decreasing inocula. the detection limit was 1 colony-forming unit (cfu)/ml for e. coli, 10 cfu/ml for p. mirabilis and e. faecalis and 10(3) cfu/ml for s. aureus. the total heat was highest in p. mirabilis ranging from 10 to 12 j, followed by e. coli (3-4 j), s. aureus (2-3 j) and e. faecalis (1.3-1.5 j). the shape of the heat flow curves was characteristic for each species independent of its initial concentration. conclusions: imc allows rapid detection of bacteriuria, much faster than conventional culture. urinary tract pathogen detection after only 3.1 h is realistic. clearly different heat flow patterns enable accurate pathogen differentiation. due to expeditious identification of urine samples that contain only low colony counts (i.e. less than 10(3) cfu/ml),  imc may become a valuable screening tool for detecting the presence of significant bacteriuria.

TI  == novel bacterial lipoprotein structures conserved in low-gc content gram-positive  bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptor 2.
AB  == bacterial lipoproteins/lipopeptides inducing host innate immune responses are sensed by mammalian toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2). these bacterial lipoproteins are structurally divided into two groups, diacylated or triacylated lipoproteins, by  the absence or presence of an amide-linked fatty acid. the presence of diacylated lipoproteins has been predicted in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas based on the absence of one modification enzyme in their genomes; however, we recently determined triacylated structures in low-gc gram-positive staphylococcus aureus, raising questions about the actual lipoprotein structure in other low-gc content gram-positive bacteria. here, through intensive ms analyses, we identified a novel and unique bacterial lipoprotein structure containing an n-acyl-s-monoacyl-glyceryl-cysteine (named the lyso structure) from low-gc gram-positive enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus bulgaricus. two of the purified native lyso-form lipoproteins induced proinflammatory cytokine production from mice macrophages in a tlr2-dependent and tlr1-independent manner but with a different dependence on tlr6. additionally, two other new lipoprotein structures were identified. one is  the "n-acetyl" lipoprotein structure containing n-acetyl-s-diacyl-glyceryl-cysteine, which was found in five gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis. the n-acetyl lipoproteins induced the proinflammatory cytokines through the tlr2/6 heterodimer. the other was identified in a mycoplasma strain and is an unusual diacyl lipoprotein structure  containing two amino acids before the lipid-modified cysteine residue. taken together, our results suggest the existence of novel tlr2-stimulating lyso and n-acetyl forms of lipoproteins that are conserved in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and provide clear evidence for the presence of yet to be identified key  enzymes involved in the bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis.

TI  == garlic ointment inhibits biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens from burn wounds.
AB  == when thermal injury damages the skin, the physical barrier protecting underlying  tissues from invading micro-organisms is compromised and the host's immune system becomes supressed, facilitating colonization and infection of burn wounds with micro-organisms. within the wound, bacteria often develop biofilms, which protect the bacteria from the immune response and enhance their resistance to antibiotics. as the prophylactic use of conventional antibiotics drives selection of drug-resistant strains, the use of novel agents to prevent biofilm formation by wound pathogens is essential. in the present study, we utilized our recently developed in vitro wound biofilm model to examine the antibiofilm activity of garlic (allium sativum). wound pathogens were inoculated on sterile cellulose discs, exposed to formulated garlic ointment (garo) or ointment base, and incubated to allow biofilm development. biofilms were quantified and visualized microscopically. garo prevented biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella pneumoniae, and caused a 2-5 log reduction of the bioburden within enterococcus faecalis biofilms. additionally, garo disrupted partially developed  biofilms produced by s. aureus, s. epidermidis and a. baumannii. the antistaphylococcal activity of garo was stable for over 3 months at room temperature. thus, garo could be used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent wound  biofilms caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria from forming, and may be a potential therapy for disrupting established staphylococcal biofilms.

TI  == post-operative wound infection in salvage laryngectomy: does antibiotic prophylaxis have an impact?
AB  == salvage laryngectomy carries a high risk of post-operative infection with reported rates of 40-61%. the purpose of this study was to analyse infections in  our own patients and review the potential impact of our current antibiotic prophylaxis (ap). a retrospective analysis of infection in 26 consecutive patients between 2000 and 2010 undergoing salvage total laryngectomy (sl) following recurrent laryngeal cancer after failed radiotherapy or chemo-radiation was undertaken. the antibiotic prophylaxis was intravenous teicoplanin, cefuroxime and metronidazole at induction and for the following 24 h. infection was defined by tabet and johnson's grade 5, categorized as pharyngocutaneous fistula. fifteen patients (58%) developed a post-operative wound infection, which occurred on average at 12 days after surgery. univariate analysis demonstrated three risk variables that had a significant correlation with infection: alcohol consumption (p = 0.01), cn stage of tumour (p < 0.01), and pre-operative albumin  levels <3.2 g/l (p = 0.012). there was a trend, though not significant, for increased infection in patients with high or low bmis. the most common organisms  isolated from clinical samples from infected patients were methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus mrsa (43%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (36%), serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and enterococcus faecalis (7% each). all these organisms are typical hospital-acquired pathogens. pseudomonas and serratia were  not covered by the prophylactic regime we used. the current antibiotic regime following sl is inadequate as the rate of infection is high. it would therefore seem logical to trial a separate antibiotic protocol of ap for patients undergoing sl that would include an extended course of antibiotics after the standard prophylaxis. in addition, infection rates may also be reduced by improving the metabolic state of patients pre-operatively by multi-disciplinary action. steps should also be taken to reduce cross-infection with nosocomial pathogens in these patients. other aspects of surgical management should be also  taken in consideration.

TI  == repeat 2-stage exchange for infected total hip arthroplasty: a viable option?
AB  == we investigated whether performing a repeat 2-stage exchange eradicates infection in patients who previously underwent 2-stage treatment for an infected total hip  arthroplasty. we identified 15 patients who had failed a 2-stage total hip arthroplasty and underwent a planned repeat 2-stage between 2000 and 2009. of the 15 patients, 8 were treated with a complete 2-stage procedure, whereas the remaining 7 patients were treated only with a first-stage resection of the infected implant. of the 8 patients who underwent complete 2-stage exchange, 1 died because of in-hospital complications, and 1 had a recurrent infection. repeat infection is highly associated with resistant organisms, obesity, and poor patient health. of the 7 patients who underwent resection without reimplantation, 3 had a recurrent infection. our data suggest that if infection can be adequately controlled after repeat resection of the joint prosthesis, reimplantation is a reasonable option.

TI  == environmental dna-encoded antibiotics fasamycins a and b inhibit fabf in type ii  fatty acid biosynthesis.
AB  == in a recent study of polyketide biosynthetic gene clusters cloned directly from soil, we isolated two antibiotics, fasamycins a and b, which showed activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. to identify the target of the fasamycins, mutants with elevated fasamycin a minimum inhibitory concentrations were selected from a wild-type culture of e. faecalis og1rf. next-generation sequencing of these mutants, in conjunction with in vitro biochemical assays, showed that the fasamycins inhibit fabf of type ii fatty acid biosynthesis (fasii). candidate gene overexpression studies also showed that fasamycin resistance is conferred by fabf overexpression. on the basis of comparisons with known fasii inhibitors and  in silico docking studies, the chloro-gem-dimethyl-anthracenone substructure seen in the fasamycins is predicted to represent a naturally occurring fabf-specific antibiotic pharmacophore. optimization of this pharmacophore should yield fabf-specific antibiotics with increased potencies and differing spectra of activity. this study demonstrates that culture-independent antibiotic discovery methods have the potential to provide access to novel metabolites with modes of action that differ from those of antibiotics currently in clinical use.

TI  == antioxidant, antimicrobial activities and fatty acid components of flower, leaf,  stem and seed of hypericum scabrum.
AB  == the hexane extracts of flower, leaf, stem, and seed of hypericum scabrum, which were collected from northwestern iran, were obtained by extraction in a soxhlet apparatus. the fatty acids were converted to methyl esters and determined by gas  chromatography/flame ionization detector (gc/fid) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (gc/ms) systems. the hexane extract from the flower, leaf, stem, and seed contained 39.1%, 43.2%, 29.0%, and 37.6% of omega-3 fatty acids, respectively. the other main components of the flower extract were tetracosane (12.2%) and palmitic acid (9.3%), and that of the leaf extract was palmitic acid  (7.4%). the stem and seed extracts contained bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (18.7% and 35.7%), nonacosane (11.7% and 3.9%) and linoleic acid (6.5% and 6.9%) as major components. the hexane extracts of different parts from h. scabrum represent an important source of omega-3 fatty acids in several hypericum species. the antioxidant activity of all hexane extracts was evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radical scavenging method. the results indicate that hexane extracts from different parts of h. scabrum possess considerable antioxidant activity. the highest radical scavenging activity was detected in seed, which had an ic50 = 165 microg/ml. the antimicrobial activity of the extracts of those samples were determined against seven gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria (bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus  aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella  pneumoniae), as well as three fungi (candida albicans, saccharomyces cerevisiae,  and aspergillus niger). the bioassay showed that the oil exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity. this study reveals that the all parts of this plant are attractive sources of fatty acid components, especially the essential ones, as well as of effective natural antioxidants.

TI  == influence of terminal substitution on structural, dna, protein binding, anticancer and antibacterial activities of palladium(ii) complexes containing 3-methoxy salicylaldehyde-4(n) substituted thiosemicarbazones.
AB  == the variable chelating behavior of 3-methoxysalicylaldehyde-4(n)-substituted thiosemicarbazones was observed in equimolar reactions with [pdcl(2)(pph(3))(2)]. the new complexes were characterized by various analytical, spectroscopic techniques (mass, (1)h-nmr, absorption, ir). all the new complexes were structurally characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction. crystallographic  results showed that the ligands h(2)l(1) and h(2)l(4) are coordinated as binegative tridentate ons donor ligands in the complexes 1 and 4 by forming six and five member rings. however, the ligands h(2)l(2) and h(2)l(3) bound to palladium in 2 and 3 as uninegative bidentate ns donors by forming a five member  chelate ring. from this study, it was found that the substitution on terminal 4(n)-nitrogen may have an influence on the chelating ability of thiosemicarbazone. the presence of hydrogen bonding in 2 and 3 might be responsible for preventing the coordination of phenolic oxygen to the metal ion.  the interaction of the complexes with calf-thymus dna (ct-dna) has been explored  by absorption and emission titration methods. based on the observations, an electrostatic binding mode of dna has been proposed. the protein binding studies  were monitored by quenching of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in the presence of complexes using lysozyme as model protein. antibacterial activity studies of the complexes have been screened against pathogenic bacteria such as enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia and pseudomonas aeruginosa. mic50 values of the complexes showed that they exhibited  significant activity against the pathogens and among them, 3 exhibited higher activity. further, anticancer activity of the complexes on the lung cancer cell line a549 has also been studied.

TI  == endocarditis in a large district general hospital: a study of the microbiological spectrum between 2000 and 2011.
AB  == infective endocarditis is one of three common cardiac infections in the united kingdom, in addition to myocarditis and pericarditis, with a reported incidence of 1.7 to 6.2 cases per 100,000 patient years. infective endocarditis can often have serious consequences and a wide variety of organisms may be the causative pathogen. there are little published data regarding the exact spectrum of organisms that cause endocarditis in the united kingdom and whether organisms such as streptococci still dominate. in the present study, all cases of endocarditis at the authors' institution, representing a typical nontertiary centre, were retrospectively examined and audited to provide a snapshot of the organism spectrum in these patients. the cases of more than 120 patients who were coded as having endocarditis by the institution's clinical coding department during the period between december 2000 and january 2011 were examined. microbiological tests and clinical case notes of all patients were reviewed. of the 101 patients diagnosed with and treated for endocarditis, 64 were male, with  a mean age of 60.57 years. the most common organisms identified were streptococcus species (31%), staphylococcus aureus (27%) and enterococcus faecalis (21%). the organisms with the highest associated mortality rate were s aureus and the 'other organism' group, which included non-hacek group (haemophilus species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, cardiobacterium hominis, eikenella corrodens and kingella species) pathogens such as candida albicans. streptococcus species and s aureus remain the main cause of endocarditis in a typical hospital setting in the united kingdom, although in a smaller proportion of cases than historical data suggests. overall, mortality remains high, and the clinician should remain vigilant to endocarditis in any patient with a positive blood culture because the number of cases of endocarditis caused by less typical organisms are increasing.

TI  == in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy of tigecycline alone and in combination with daptomycin and rifampin against gram-positive cocci isolated from surgical wound infection.
AB  == the aim of this work was to determine the in vitro activity of tigecycline and its bactericidal effect for a large number of gram-positive cocci, as well as to  investigate its in vitro interaction with six clinically used antibiotics. in vivo, a wound model was established through the panniculus carnosus of balb/c mice, and then inoculated with 5 x 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu) of staphylococcus aureus or enterococcus faecalis. for each bacterial strain, the study included an infected or non-infected group that did not receive any treatment, three groups singly treated with tigecycline, rifampin, and daptomycin, and two groups that received tigecycline treatment plus rifampin or daptomycin. in the in vitro studies, tigecycline, daptomycin, and teicoplanin were active against all of the 48 gram-positive isolates. the combination of tigecycline with rifampicin and daptomycin was synergistic against s. aureus and  enterococcus spp. in the in vivo studies, all groups treated with single drugs showed statistically significant results compared to the control group. the two groups treated with a combination of drugs showed the highest antimicrobial efficacy. in conclusion, our results suggested a strong activity of tigecycline alone and in combination with other antimicrobial agents against multi-resistant  gram-positive organisms isolated from wound infections.

TI  == pharmacological, genotoxic and phytochemical properties of selected south african medicinal plants used in treating stomach-related ailments.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: the evaluated medicinal plants are used in south  african traditional medicine in treating stomach-related ailments. aims of the study: the study aimed at evaluating the pharmacological, genotoxic and phytochemical properties of the seven selected medicinal plants used for treating stomach-related ailments. materials and methods: ethyl acetate (etoac), ethanol (etoh) 70% and water extracts of the selected plant parts were evaluated for their antimicrobial and anthelmintic activities using microdilution assays. gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus), gram-negative bacterium (escherichia coli) and candida albicans were used for antimicrobial assays. caenorhabditis elegans was used for the anthelmintic assay. plant extracts were also assayed for their cyclooxygenase-inhibitory activity against cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 enzymes. the ames test was used to evaluate the genotoxicity of the plant extracts. a spectrophotometric method was used to determine the total phenolics, gallotannins, flavonoids and saponins. results: twelve extracts exhibited minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) <1 mg/ml against the bacterial test strains, and five extracts exhibited mic <1 mg/ml against candida albicans. the etoac extract of tetradenia riparia had the best minimum lethal concentration (mlc) value (0.004 mg/ml) against caenorhabditis elegans. all the etoac extracts exhibited percentage inhibition in the range of 50.7-94.7% against cox-1 and -2 enzymes at 250 mug/ml. all the plant extracts were non-mutagenic towards salmonella typhimurium tester strains ta98, ta100 and ta1537 without metabolic activation. phytochemical analysis revealed relatively high amounts of total phenolics, gallotannins and flavonoids in the evaluated plant extracts. conclusions: the general pharmacological activities exhibited by  some of the plant extracts in this study support the traditional uses of the selected plants in treating stomach-related ailments. the ames test showed that all the plant extracts were non-mutagenic but cytotoxicity tests are needed to ascertain the safety for long-term consumption.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance dynamics and isolation rate of staphylococci and enterococci from patients of reconstructive surgery units].
AB  == the dynamics of isolation of staphylococci and enterococci from clinical material of patients and their antibiotic susceptibility within a 5-year period (2005-2009) was analysed. 5990 isolates were tested: 1250 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, 3268 isolates of s. epidermidis, 1005 isolates of enterococcus faecalis and 467 isolates of e. faecium. grampositive infections were shown to be prevailing within the last 2-3 years, the nosocomial epidermal staphylococci more and more replacing s. aureus (the ratio of s. epidermidis and  s. aureus in 2009 was 3.3). the isolation rate of e. faecalis significantly increased (by 3.5 times) and the ratio of e. faecalis and e. faecium in 2009 was  4.3. the microflora composition with respect to the isolation source was analysed and its clinical significance was estimated. the study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that oxacillin had its own specific niche, while antibiotics active against resistant grampositive cocci, such as rifampicin, fusidic acid, fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin), cefoxitin, as well as amoxicillin/clavulane in infections due to e. faecalis, might be considered as the drugs of choice. in the treatment of nosocomial infections, when the etiological role of mrsa or vre is suspected or confirmed, the complex therapy should obligatory include the most active antibiotics (vancomycin or linezolid among them).

TI  == platelet and neutrophil responses to gram positive pathogens in patients with bacteremic infection.
AB  == background: many gram-positive pathogens aggregate and activate platelets in vitro and this has been proposed to contribute to virulence. platelets can also form complexes with neutrophils but little is however known about platelet and platelet-neutrophil responses in bacterial infection. methodology/principal findings: we added isolates of gram-positive bacteria from 38 patients with a bacteremic infection to blood drawn from the same patient. aggregometry and flow  cytometry were used to assess platelet aggregation and to quantify activation of  platelets, neutrophils, and platelet-neutrophils complexes (pncs) induced by the  bacteria. fifteen healthy persons served as controls. most isolates of staphylococcus aureus, beta hemolytic streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis induced aggregation of platelets from their respective hosts, whereas pneumococci failed to do so. s. aureus isolates induced platelet aggregation more rapidly in  patients than in controls, whereas platelet activation by s. aureus was lower in  patients than in controls. pncs were more abundant in baseline samples from patients than in healthy controls and most bacterial isolates induced additional  pnc formation and neutrophil activation. conclusion/significance: we have demonstrated for the first time that bacteria isolated from patients with gram-positive bacteremia can induce platelet activation and aggregation, pnc formation, and neutrophil activation in the same infected host. this underlines the significance of these interactions during infection, which could be a target  for future therapies in sepsis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of some african medicinal plants used traditionally against infectious diseases.
AB  == context: plants are known to play a crucial role in african traditional medicine  for the treatment of infection diseases. objectives: to investigate the claimed antimicrobial properties of plants traditionally used in african countries, providing scientific validation for their use. materials and methods: eighty-three polar and non-polar extracts from 22 medicinal plants were screened  for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae) and mycobacterium smegmatis using the broth microdilution method. results and discussion: in vitro antibacterial activity against one or more tested bacteria was shown by 83% of the extracts. the highest activity was obtained with the methanol extracts of the aerial parts of acacia karroo hayne (fabaceae) and anacardium occidentale l. (anacardiaceae) and the roots of bridelia cathartica g. bertol (euphorbiaceae), against s. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 7.5 microg/ml). the same mic values were exhibited against e. faecalis by the methanol extract of a. occidentale, the dichloromethane and methanol extracts of b. cathartica and the ethyl acetate extract of momordica balsamina l. (curcubitaceae) leaves. gram-negative bacteria  were less sensitive; the growth of p. aeruginosa was significantly inhibited (mic = 31 microg/ml) by the n-hexane and methanol extracts of gomphocarpus fruticosus  (l.) ait. (asclepiadaceae) fruits and by the dichloromethane extract of trichilia emetica vahl (meliaceae) seeds. most of the active extracts were rich in fenols/flavonoids. conclusion: this study supports the use of most of the studied plants in traditional medicine, for the treatment of infectious diseases. some of them are worthy of further investigation.

TI  == vancomycin tolerance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  == vancomycin, a glycopeptide antimicrobial agent, represents the last line of defence against a wide range of multi-resistant gram-positive pathogens such as enterococci, staphylococci and streptococci. however, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and staphylococci, along with vancomycin-tolerant clinical isolates,  are compromising the therapeutic efficacy of vancomycin. it is conceivable that tolerance may emerge during prolonged vancomycin use. it has not been until recently, however, that the molecular basis of this tolerance began to be understood. superoxide anions might be involved in the bactericidal activity of vancomycin in enterococci, and recent evidence suggests that the stringent response is partly responsible for vancomycin tolerance in enterococcus faecalis. the mechanism of vancomycin tolerance in staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus  pneumoniae is sometimes associated with a reduction of autolysin activity. vancomycin tolerance in s. aureus and s. pneumoniae also appears to be somehow related with the two-component regulatory systems linked to cell envelope stress, although the precise molecular regulatory pathways remain poorly defined.

TI  == in vitro activity effects of twelve antibiotics alone and in association against  twenty-seven enterococcus faecalis strains isolated from italian patients with infective endocarditis: high in vitro synergistic effect of the association ceftriaxone-fosfomycin.
AB  == background: in 2004-2008, the epidemiological and clinical infective endocarditis study group (sei) evaluated 852 cases of infective endocarditis. staphylococcus aureus was the main involved pathogen (24.5%) and enterococcus faecalis etiology  was described in 11% of the cases. the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of 12 antibiotics alone and in association against 27 strains of e. faecalis isolated from blood cultures of patients with infective endocarditis. results: the results showed high in vitro activity of tigecycline, daptomycin and linezolid. a high synergistic effect was obtained with the association ceftriaxone-fosfomycin [fractional inhibitory concentration (fic)(50) = 0.34, fic(90) = 0.78]. furthermore, ceftriaxone plus ampicillin presented additive results (fic(50) = 0.66, fic(90) = 1.00), and ceftriaxone plus fosfomycin and ceftriaxone plus ampicillin were significantly more active in vitro than each drug alone. the efficacy of ceftriaxone plus fosfomycin was confirmed by the association testing using the broth dilution technique. conclusion: fosfomycin seems particularly significant and its association with ceftriaxone could be considered as a useful therapeutic option in medical treatment of e. faecalis infective endocarditis.

TI  == extracellular dna in biofilms.
AB  == extracellular dna (edna) is an important biofilm component that was recently discovered. its presence has been initially observed in biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, then enterococcus faecalis and staphylococci. autolysis is the common mechanism by which edna is released. in p. aeruginosa edna is generated by lysis of a bacterial subpopulation, under control of quorum sensing system. in e. faecalis autolysis proceeds in a fratricide mode, resulting from a process similar to necrosis of eukaryotic cells. in staphylococcus aureus autolysis originates by an altruistic  suicide, i.e., a programmed cell death similar to apoptosis of eukaryotic cells.  in s. aureus autolysis is mediated by murein hydrolase, while in s. epidermidis by the autolysin protein atle. in p. aeruginosa edna is located primarily in the  stalks of mushroom-shaped multicellular structures. in s. aureus the crucial role of edna in stabilizing biofilm is highlighted by the disgregating effect of dnase i. edna represents an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. edna and other microbial structural motifs are recognized by the innate immune system via the tlr family of pattern recognition receptors (prrs).

TI  == mechanistic analysis of muraymycin analogues: a guide to the design of mray inhibitors.
AB  == the systematic structure-activity relationship (sar) of the muraymycins (mrys) using an ugi four-component reaction (u4cr) was investigated. the impact of the lipophilic substituent on antibacterial activity was significant, and the analogues 8 and 9 having a lipophilic side chain exhibited good activity against  a range of gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including mrsa and vre. further investigation of compounds 8 and 9 revealed these analogues to be selective inhibitors of the mray transferase and nontoxic to hepg2 cells. the sar of the accessory urea-peptide moiety indicated that it could be simplified. our sar study of the mrys suggests a probable mechanism for inhibition of the mray, where the inner moiety of the urea-dipeptide motif interacts with the carbohydrate recognition domain in the cytoplasmic loop 5. the predicted binding model would provide further direction toward the design of potent mray inhibitors. this study has set the stage for the generation of novel antibacterial "lead" compounds based on mrys.

AB  == wap four disulfide core domain 2 (wfdc2) is a four disulfide core (4-dsc) protein secreted in the milk of the tammar wallaby. it is comprised of two 4-dsc domains  assigned domain iii at the nh2-terminal end and domain ii at the cooh-terminal end. the wfdc2 gene was expressed only during pregnancy, early lactation, towards the end of lactation and involution. the wfdc2 protein showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica and pseudomonas aeruginosa and this activity resided with domain ii. there was no antibacterial activity detected against enterococcus faecalis. the observed expression pattern  of tammar wfdc2 and its antibacterial activity suggests a role to either reduce mastitis in the mammary gland caused by s. aureus or to protect the gut of the young at a time when it is not immune-competent. the latter effect could be achieved without disturbing the balance of commensal gut flora such as e. faecalis.

TI  == scleroderma digital ulcers complicated by infection with fecal pathogens.
AB  == objective: digital ulcers represent one of the most frequent complications of systemic sclerosis (ssc; scleroderma); they are very painful, scarcely responsive to treatment, and often responsible for marked limitations on daily activities, including patient self-care. infectious complications may severely compromise the outcome of skin lesions in a significant percentage of patients. numerous pathogens of different origin may be involved, including bacteria from patient endogenous flora. here we evaluated the possible involvement of fecal pathogens in scleroderma digital ulcers. methods: among a series of 82 ssc patients with digital ulcers, we retrospectively analyzed 42 subjects with clinical signs of local bacterial infection. all digital ulcers with suspected infection have been  investigated by microbiologic examinations. results: bacterial infection was confirmed in all 42 patients investigated; in particular, staphylococcus aureus were the most frequently found (50%). interestingly, 11 (26%) of 42 patients showed digital ulcers infected with intestinal bacteria; specifically, 7 patients were positive for escherichia coli and 4 for enterococcus faecalis. diffuse cutaneous ssc patients were more numerous in this subgroup versus the other 31 patients (fisher's p = 0.011). conclusion: a number of effective measures involving health care personnel and hospital environment are essential in the management of digital ulcers and prevention of infectious complications. in addition, the prevalence of fecal pathogens in one-quarter of cases, never reported previously, suggests an important role of a patient's self-care limitations, mainly during intercurrent home medications. consequently, methodical education on hand hygiene of both patients and relatives, frequently involved in ulcer medications, is mandatory to avoid such deleterious complications.

TI  == surgical therapy of hip-joint empyema. is the girdlestone arthroplasty still up to date?
AB  == purpose: hip-joint empyema is a severe local infection that can cause general illness and, in the worst-case scenario, death by septic complications. for severe hip-joint infections, the girdlestone arthroplasty has been an established treatment option for many decades. we describe functional midterm results after treatment of haematological and postoperative hip-joint infections. methods: from 2000 to 2010, 24 patients underwent surgical treatment for 27 hip-joint empyemas. the surgical procedures included radical debridement, implantation of local antibiotic beads and soft tissue management. besides clinical, laboratory and imaging parameters, we analysed the harris hip score (hhs). results: twenty-three patients (26 hips) were followed up after a mean of 30 (3.1-126.8) months. the study group consists of 12 men and 11 women, with an average height of 1.71 m, weight of 84.7 kg and body mass index (bmi) of 28.6 kg/m(2). hip-joint empyema was due to haematological septic spread in eight patients, surgery related in 12  hips and other causes in six cases. one patient died due to septic complications  during the hospital stay. intraoperative bacterial culture was positive in 50%, with staphylococcus aureus as the most common organism (n = 11). average hospital stay was 35 days. hhs significantly improved from 18.2 preoperatively to 47.8 at  follow-up. functional results were mainly poor, but pain relief increased significantly. the infection control rate was 96% with four (15%) complications.  conclusion: resection arthroplasty by girdlestone is able to control infection in most cases with an acceptable complication rate but poor functional results. in conclusion, the girdlestone arthroplasty still is an essential surgical strategy  for treating hip-joint empyema in cases in which functional outcome is of lesser  priority.

TI  == predictors of in-hospital mortality in elderly patients with bacteraemia admitted to an internal medicine ward.
AB  == background: infectious diseases are a common cause of increased morbidity and mortality in elderly patients. bacteraemia in the elderly is a difficult diagnosis and a therapeutic challenge due to age-related vicissitudes and to their comorbidities. the main purpose of the study was to assess independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality among the elderly with bacteraemia admitted to  an internal medicine ward. methods: overall, a cohort of 135 patients, 65 years of age and older, with bacteraemia were retrospectively studied. data related to  demographic information, comorbidities, clinical parameters on admission, source  and type of infection, microorganism isolated in the blood culture, laboratory data and empirical antibiotic treatment was recorded from each patient. multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of all-cause in-hospital mortality. results: of these 135 patients, 45.9% were women. the most common infections in this group of patients were urinary tract infections (46.7%). the main microorganisms isolated in the blood cultures were escherichia coli (14.9%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (12.0%), non-mrsa (11.4%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.1%) and enterococcus faecalis (8.0%). the in-hospital mortality was 22.2%. independent prognostic factors associated with in-hospital mortality were age >/= 85 years, chronic renal disease, bacteraemia of unknown focus and cognitive impairment at admission (or,  2.812 [95% ci, 1.039-7.611; p = 0.042]; or, 6.179 [95% ci, 1.840-20.748; p = 0.003]; or, 8.673 [95% ci, 1.557-48.311; p = 0.014] and or, 3.621 [95% ci, 1.226-10.695; p = 0.020], respectively). by multivariate analysis appropriate antibiotic therapy was not associated with lower odds of mortality. conclusion: bacteraemia in the elderly has a high mortality rate. there are no set of signs or clinical features that can predict bacteraemia in the elderly. however, older  age (>/= 85 years), chronic renal disease, bacteraemia of unknown focus and severe cognitive impairment adversely affects the outcome of elderly patients with bacteraemia admitted to an internal medicine ward.

TI  == acanthamoeba polyphaga, a potential environmental vector for the transmission of  food-borne and opportunistic pathogens.
AB  == the endosymbiotic relationship could represent for many bacteria an important condition favouring their spread in the environment and in foods. for this purpose we studied the behaviour of some food-borne and opportunistic pathogens (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, aeromonas hydrophila, yersinia enterocolitica) when internalized in acanthamoeba polyphaga. our results confirm the capability of the bacteria tested to grow within amoebal hosts. we can observe two types of interactions of the bacteria internalized in a. polyphaga. the first type, showed by y. enterocolitica and a. hydrophila, was characterized by an early replication, probably followed by the killing and digestion of the bacteria. the  second type, showed by e. faecalis and s. aureus was characterized by the persistence and grow inside the host without lysis. lastly, when amoebae were co-cultured with l. monocytogenes and s. enteritidis, an eclipse phase followed by an active intracellular growth was observed, suggesting a third type of predator-prey trend. the extracellular count in presence of a. polyphaga, as a result of an intracellular multiplication and subsequent release, was characterized by an increase of e. faecalis, s. aureus, l. monocytogenes and s. enteritidis, and by a low or absent cell count for y. enterocolitica and a. hydrophila. our study suggests that the investigated food-borne and opportunistic pathogens are, in most cases, able to interact with a. polyphaga, to intracellularly replicate and, lastly, to be potentially spread in the environment, underlining the possible role of this protozoan in food contamination.

TI  == the revival of fosfomycin.
AB  == fosfomycin, originally named phosphonomycin, was discovered in spain in 1969. there are three forms of fosfomycin: fosfomycin tromethamine (a soluble salt) and fosfomycin calcium for oral use, and fosfomycin disodium for intravenous use. fosfomycin is a bactericidal antibiotic that interferes with cell wall synthesis  in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by inhibiting the initial step involving phosphoenolpyruvate synthetase. it has a broad spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. it is highly active against gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus, and against gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae. its unique mechanism of action may provide a synergistic effect to other classes of antibiotics including beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. oral fosfomycin is mainly used in the treatment of urinary tract infections, particularly those caused by escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. intravenous fosfomycin has been administered in combination with other antibiotics for the treatment of nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. fosfomycin has good distribution into tissues, achieving clinically relevant concentrations  in serum, kidneys, bladder wall, prostate, lungs, inflamed tissues, bone, cerebrospinal fluid, abscess fluid, and heart valves. fosfomycin is well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events. further randomized controlled  trials are needed in order to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous fosfomycin for the management of nosocomial infections due to mdr pathogens.

TI  == [investigation of the efficacy of some disinfectants against nosocomial staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp. isolates].
AB  == nosocomial infections which exhibit an increasing trend worldwide, are important  contributors to morbidity and mortality. most bacteria that cause nosocomial infections can retain their viability even after exposure to disinfectants in routine practice. this study was conducted to determine the susceptibilities of nosocomial staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp. isolates to various disinfectants. a total of 30 s.aureus [16 were methicillin-resistant (mrsa), 14 were methicillin-susceptible (mssa)] and 21 enterococcus spp. (13 e.faecalis, 7 e.faecium, 1 non-typable enterococcus spp.) strains isolated from clinical samples of hospitalized patients as nosocomial infection agents in the central microbiology laboratory of ibn-i sina hospital, ankara university, faculty of medicine, were included in the study. glutaraldehyde (2% wt/vol), chlorhexidine gluconate (4% wt/vol), 2-propanol (70% vol/vol), povidone iodine (7.5% wt/vol), povidone iodine (10% wt/vol) and hydrogen peroxide (3% wt/vol) susceptibilities of the isolates were investigated by quantitative suspension test at contact times of 3, 5, and 10 minutes. all of the isolates were found susceptible to glutaraldehyde (2%), chlorhexidine gluconate (4%), povidone iodine (7.5%), povidone iodine (10%) and 2-propanol (70%) at all tested contact times. however,  12 s.aureus (5 mssa, 7 mrsa) and 3 enterococci (2 e.faecium, 1 e.faecalis) isolates were found susceptible to hydrogen peroxide (3%) at 3 minutes contact time; 11 s.aureus (4 mssa, 7 mrsa) and 7 e.faecalis isolates were found susceptible at 5 minutes contact time, and 6 s.aureus (4 mssa, 2 mrsa) and 3 enterococci (1 e.faecium, 2 e.faecalis) isolates were found susceptible at 10 minutes contact time. one mssa and 8 enterococci (4 e.faecium, 3 e.faecalis, 1 enterococcus spp.) isolates were found resistant to hydrogen peroxide (3%) at 10  minutes contact time. in conclusion, glutaraldehyde (2%), chlorhexidine gluconate (4%), povidone iodine (7.5%), povidone iodine (10%) and 2-propanol (70%) can be safely used against s.aureus and enterococcus spp. owing to their high effectiveness, however, hydrogen peroxide (3%) should not be preferred against those strains due to the presence of resistant isolates, in ankara university ibn-i sina hospital.

TI  == functional analysis of environmental dna-derived type ii polyketide synthases reveals structurally diverse secondary metabolites.
AB  == a single gram of soil is predicted to contain thousands of unique bacterial species. the majority of these species remain recalcitrant to standard culture methods, prohibiting their use as sources of unique bioactive small molecules. the cloning and analysis of dna extracted directly from environmental samples (environmental dna, edna) provides a means of exploring the biosynthetic capacity of natural bacterial populations. environmental dna libraries contain large reservoirs of bacterial genetic diversity from which new secondary metabolite gene clusters can be systematically recovered and studied. the identification and heterologous expression of type ii polyketide synthase-containing edna clones is  reported here. functional analysis of three soil dna-derived polyketide synthase  systems in streptomyces albus revealed diverse metabolites belonging to well-known, rare, and previously uncharacterized structural families. the first of these systems is predicted to encode the production of the known antibiotic landomycin e. the second was found to encode the production of a metabolite with  a previously uncharacterized pentacyclic ring system. the third was found to encode the production of unique kb-3346-5 derivatives, which show activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. these results, together with those of other small-molecule-directed metagenomic studies, suggest that culture-independent approaches are capable of accessing biosynthetic diversity that has not yet been  extensively explored using culture-based methods. the large-scale functional screening of edna clones should be a productive strategy for generating structurally previously uncharacterized chemical entities for use in future drug  development efforts.

TI  == unraveling the protein targets of vancomycin in living s. aureus and e. faecalis  cells.
AB  == vancomycin is a potent glycopeptide antibiotic that has evolved to specifically bind to the d-ala-d-ala dipeptide termini of nascent peptidoglycans. although this mode of action is well established, several studies indicate that vancomycin and analogues exploit noncanonical target sites. in order to address all vancomycin targets in clinically relevant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus  faecalis strains we developed a series of small-molecule photoaffinity probes based on vancomycin. proteomic profiling revealed the specific labeling of two previously unknown vancomycin targets that are likely to contribute to its antibiotic activity. the specific inhibition of the major staphylococcal autolysin atl confirms previous observations that vancomycin alters s. aureus cell morphology by interaction with the autolytic machinery. moreover, in e. faecalis the vancomycin photoprobe specifically binds to an abc transporter protein, which likely impedes the uptake of essential nutrients such as sugars and peptides. the labeling of these two prominent membrane targets in living cells reveals a thus far unexplored mode of vancomycin binding and inhibition that could allow a rational design of variants with improved activity.

AB  == fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. we constructed a novel vector based on the e. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pat28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. the plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the camp-factor gene (cfb) promoter of streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pbsu101. upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by facs-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. to assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. we successfully labeled streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the egfp reporter plasmid pbsu101. in all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level egfp expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.

TI  == validation of the zurich burn-biofilm model.
AB  == background: despite advances in the use of topical and parenteral antimicrobial therapy and the practice of early tangential burn-wound excision, bacterial infection remains a major problem in the management of burn victims today. the purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a polyspecies biofilm model with bacteria known to cause severe infections in burn patients. the model is simple to prepare, maintain and analyse, and allows for short-term exposure to antimicrobials. results: initial experiments showed that it was impossible to establish balanced polyspecies biofilms with an inoculum of gram-positive and -negative bacteria. after 64.5 h of incubation, the gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) had suppressed the gram-positives (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus intermedius). however, adding the gram-negative bacteria after 41.5 h to an established biofilm of gram-positives resulted in a balanced microbial consortium. after 64.5 h, all  species were present in high numbers (10(7) to 10(8) colony forming units (cfu) per biofilm). multiple repetitions showed high reproducibility of biofilm formation without significant differences between and within experiments. combined fluorescence in situ hybridisation/confocal laser scanning microscopy (fish/clsm) analyses, for which biofilms had to be grown on a different non-flexible substrate (hydroxy apatite), revealed that, by 41.5 h, the biofilm consisted of an almost confluent layer of bacteria firmly adherent to the substratum. after 64.5 h (22 h after the addition of the gram negatives), the biofilm consisted of a confluent mixture of single cells, an abundance of galaxies of bacteria with small lacunae and large amounts of extracellular matrix polysaccharides. conclusions: the polyspecies biofilm model contains the most prevalent burn-associated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens and mimics the gram-negative shift observed in vivo. it shows excellent reproducibility. it should allow adaptation to the bacterial spectrum prevalent in different burn centres and lead to a much more reliable investigation of the efficiency of topical antimicrobial agents than models operating with planktonic  bacteria. the experiments further open up the perspective to create an in vivo model using these biofilms as infectious agents.

TI  == first detection of the staphylococcal trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk and the dfrk-carrying transposon tn559 in enterococci.
AB  == the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk has been recently described in staphylococcus aureus, but so far has not been found in other bacteria. a total of 166 enterococci of different species (e. faecium, e. faecalis, e. hirae, e. durans, e. gallinarum, and e. casseliflavus) and origins (food, clinical diseases in humans, healthy humans or animals, and sewage) were studied for their susceptibility to trimethoprim as determined by agar dilution (european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing) and the presence of (a) the dfrk gene and its genetic environment and (b) other dfr genes. the dfrk gene was detected in 49% of the enterococci (64% and 42% of isolates with minimum inhibitory concentrations of >/=2 mg/l or </=1 mg/l, respectively). the tet(l)-dfrk linkage  was detected in 21% of dfrk-positive enterococci. the chromosomal location of the dfrk gene was identified in one e. faecium isolate in which the dfrk was not linked to tet(l) gene but was part of a tn559 element, which was integrated in the chromosomal radc gene. this tn559 element was also found in 14 additional isolates. all combinations of dfr genes were detected among the isolates tested (dfrk, dfrg, dfrf, dfrk+dfrg, dfrk+dfrf, dfrf+dfrg, and dfrf+dfrg+dfrk). the gene dfrk gene was found together with other dfr genes in 58% of the tested enterococci. this study suggested an exchange of the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrk between enterococci and staphylococci, as previously observed for the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrg.

AB  == the sea constitutes one of the most promising sources of novel compounds with potential application in human therapeutics. in particular, algae have proved to  be an interesting source of new bioactive compounds. in this work, six meroditerpenoids (epitaondiol, epitaondiol diacetate, epitaondiol monoacetate, stypotriol triacetate, 14-ketostypodiol diacetate and stypodiol) isolated from the brown alga stypopodium flabelliforme were tested for their cell proliferation inhibitory activity in five cell lines. cell lines tested included human colon adenocarcinoma (caco-2), human neuroblastoma (sh-sy5y), rat basophilic leukemia (rbl-2h3), murine macrophages (raw.267) and chinese hamster fibroblasts (v79). antimicrobial activity of the compounds was also evaluated against staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus, enterococcus  faecalis and micrococcus luteus. overall, the compounds showed good activity against all cell lines, with sh-sy5y and raw.267 being the most susceptible. antimicrobial capacity was observed for epitaondiol monoacetate, stypotriol triacetate and stypodiol, with the first being the most active. the results suggest that these molecules deserve further studies in order to evaluate their potential as therapeutic agents.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.

TI  == neutral metallated and meso-substituted porphyrins as antimicrobial agents against gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a bacterial pathogen that causes severe infections among humans. the increasing emergence of antibiotic resistance necessitates the development of new strategies to combat the spread of disease. one approach is photodynamic inactivation using porphyrin photosensitizers, which generate superoxide and other radicals in the presence of light, causing cell death via the oxidation of proteins and lipids. in this study, we analyzed a novel library  of meso-substituted and metallated porphyrins for activity against multidrug-resistant s. aureus. from a library of 251 compounds, 51 showed antimicrobial activity, in three discrete classes of activity: those that functioned only in light, those that had toxicity only in darkness, and those that displayed activity regardless of illumination. we further demonstrated the broad-spectrum activity of these compounds against a variety of pathogens, including bacillus anthracis, enterococcus faecalis, and escherichia coli. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) analyses of lead compounds (xpz-263 and xpz-271) revealed strong activity and killing towards methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains. an analysis of mutation frequencies revealed low incidences of resistance to lead compounds by e. coli and mrsa. finally, an exploration of the underlying mechanism of action suggests that these compounds do not depend solely upon light-induced radical generation for toxicity, highlighting their potential for clinical applications.

TI  == population biology of gram-positive pathogens: high-risk clones for dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == infections caused by multiresistant gram-positive bacteria represent a major health burden in the community as well as in hospitalized patients. staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium are well-known pathogens of hospitalized patients, frequently linked with resistance  against multiple antibiotics, compromising effective therapy. streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes are important pathogens in the community and s. aureus has recently emerged as an important community-acquired pathogen. population genetic studies reveal that recombination prevails as a driving force  of genetic diversity in e. faecium, e. faecalis, s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, and thus, these species are weakly clonal. although recombination has a relatively modest role driving the genetic variation of the core genome of s. aureus, the horizontal acquisition of resistance and virulence genes plays a key  role in the emergence of new clinically relevant clones in this species. in this  review, we discuss the population genetics of e. faecium, e. faecalis, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and s. aureus. knowledge of the population structure of these pathogens is not only highly relevant for (molecular) epidemiological research but also for identifying the genetic variation that underlies changes in clinical behaviour, to improve our understanding of the pathogenic behaviour of particular clones and to identify novel targets for vaccines or immunotherapy.

TI  == tn916-like genetic elements: a diverse group of modular mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria are responsible for morbidity and mortality in healthcare environments. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae can all exhibit clinically relevant multidrug resistance phenotypes due to acquired resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. it is possible that clinically relevant multidrug-resistant clostridium difficile strains will appear in the future, as the organism is adept at acquiring mobile genetic elements (plasmids and transposons). conjugative transposons of the tn916/tn1545 family, which carry major antibiotic resistance determinants, are transmissible between these different bacteria by a conjugative mechanism during which the elements are excised by a staggered cut from donor cells, converted to a circular form, transferred by cell-cell contact and inserted into recipient cells by a site-specific recombinase. the ability of these conjugative transposons to acquire additional, clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes importantly contributes to the emergence of multidrug resistance.

TI  == synthetic 3-arylideneflavanones as inhibitors of the initial stages of biofilm formation by staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of twenty two synthetic flavonoids is reported. among  them three 3-arylideneflavanones, 2b, 2c, and 2i, were shown to be highly active  against staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, and enterococcus faecalis reference strains, with mic (minimal inhibitory concentration) values ranging from 4.68 microg/ml (14.3 microm) to 37.5 microg/ml (119.7 microm). the synergy of oxacillin and vancomycin with 2c, evaluated as fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici) was shown (against planktonic culture of s. aureus a3  and e. faecium 138/09 clinical strains). the presence of 2c in the culture medium diminished the initial adhesion of bacteria to an abiotic surface. such an effect resulted in a decrease in biofilm formation during prolonged culture. unfortunately, 2e failed to eradicate the s. aureus mature biofilm which was already preformed, however, decreased the number of live biofilm cells. the biofilm of e. faecalis was more susceptible to the action of 3-arylideneflavanone 2c than the s. aureus biofilm. the finding that 3-arylideneflavanones are lipophilic, cause bacterial aggregation, and influence the integrity of membranes making them permeable to syto 9/propidium iodide dyes may implicate the cytoplasmic membrane as a target site for these compounds activity.

TI  == airway pathogens during the first year after lung transplantation: a single-center experience.
AB  == after lung transplantation, a high level of immunosuppression is needed to prevent rejection. this demand renders recipients more sensitive to infections. as pulmonary infections are a major clinical problem during the first postoperative year after lung transplantation, preventive treatment and regular surveillance examinations are needed for immediate, adequate therapy. we describe the airway pathogens registered during the first posttransplantation year among our 12 lung transplant recipients since december 2008. samples were obtained for  microbiologic analysis from the upper and lower respiratory tracts and from serum as part of routine care. during the first year after transplantation the most frequent pathogens were fungi (candida albicans 82%; aspergillus 50%), pneumocystis (8%), gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas spp 60%; klebsiella 25%, acinetobacter 17%; escherichia coli 17%; and enterococcus faecalis 25%), and staphylococcus aureus (50%, including methicillin-resistant strains 25%). this pathogen spectrum in the first postoperative year after lung transplantation was  similar to other centers. colonization with pseudomonas or fungi presented early  and was prevalent among our patients.

TI  == recognition of pathogenic microbes by the drosophila phagocytic pattern recognition receptor eater.
AB  == non-opsonic phagocytosis is a primordial form of pathogen recognition that is mediated by the direct interaction of phagocytic receptors with microbial surfaces. in the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster, the egf-like repeat containing scavenger receptor eater is expressed by phagocytes and is required to survive infections with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. however, the mechanisms by which this receptor recognizes different types of bacteria are poorly understood. to address this problem, we generated a soluble, fc-tagged receptor variant of eater comprising the n-terminal 199 amino acids including four egf-like repeats. we first established that eater-fc displayed specific binding to broad yet distinct classes of heat- or ethanol-inactivated microbes and behaved similarly to the membrane-bound, full-length eater receptor. we then  used eater-fc as a tool to probe eater binding to the surface of live bacteria. eater-fc bound equally well to naive or inactivated staphylococcus aureus or enterococcus faecalis, suggesting that in vivo, eater directly targets live gram-positive bacteria, enabling their phagocytic clearance and destruction. by contrast, eater-fc was unable to interact with live, naive gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these bacteria, eater-fc binding required membrane-disrupting treatments. furthermore,  we found that cecropin a, a cationic, membrane-disrupting antimicrobial peptide,  could promote eater-fc binding to live e. coli, even at sublethal concentrations. these results suggest a previously unrecognized mechanism by which antimicrobial  peptides cooperate with phagocytic receptors to extend the range of microbes that can be targeted by a single, germline-encoded receptor.

AB  == background: the aim of this paper was to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) parameters of continuous (ci) and intermittent infusion (iti) of ertapenem into critically ill patients with severe abdominal infections. methods: twenty septic patients hospitalized in a university hospital intensive care unit were enrolled in the study. half of the patients received ertapenem as  an iti 1 g bolus once daily, and the other half of the patients received the same dose via ci over 24 h following a 1-g loading dose. blood was drawn 1, 12 and 24  h after terminating iti or on days 2, 3 and 5 after starting ci for each patient. after centrifugation, the drawn blood was frozen at -80 degrees c until being examined by high-performance liquid-chromatography analysis. results: median serum-free ertapenem concentrations were as follows: fcmax = 98.9 mg/l and fcmin  = 2.5 mg/l for iti, and fcss=15.9 mg/l for ci. the iti and ci median total clearance and volumes of distribution were 2.2 l/h vs. 2.5 l/h and 15.4 l vs. 21.0 l, respectively. the ertapenem mic ranges were as follows: escherichia coli  (0.006 to 0.5 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (0.023 to 0.5 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.023 to 0.5 mg/l), staphylococcus aureus (0.38 to 3 mg/l), streptococcus viridians (0.38 to 3 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (0.38 to 3 mg/l). iti and ci provided steady-state serum-free ertapenem concentrations constantly above the mic for all bacteria. conclusion: ertapenem exhibited satisfactory pk/pd parameters and achieved serum-free concentrations 100% of the time, above even the high mic of extracellular pathogens normally encountered during severe abdominal infections. ci administration resulted in equally effective pk/pd parameters as iti in normal weight, good renal-function patients.

TI  == the microbiology of secondary and postoperative pancreatic infections: implications for antimicrobial management.
AB  == hypothesis: we reviewed our experience with secondary pancreatic infections with  a focus on preemptive intervention and the potential alteration of the recovered  microbial flora. the pathogens associated with postoperative pancreatic infections were analyzed with respect to nonenteric organisms, if any, that were  recovered. we hypothesized that our findings might alter the antimicrobial management of these patients. design: retrospective review. setting: hospitals affiliated with the university of tennessee health science center, memphis. patients: patients developing secondary and postoperative pancreatic infections following severe acute pancreatitis. methods: factors examined relative to secondary pancreatitis included preoperative antibiotic use and antecedent extrapancreatic infections potentially implicated in seeding the pancreatic bed.  patients who had elective resection received 24 to 48 hours of antibiotic prophylaxis. results: twenty-two patients required surgery for secondary infections following severe acute pancreatitis, with 29 pathogenic isolates being recovered. of these 22 patients, 14 received vancomycin hydrochloride prior to surgical intervention. of those 14 patients, 6 had isolates recovered at the time of surgery that were positive for enterococcus faecalis and 5 of these isolates were vancomycin resistant. eight of the 22 patients received antifungal prophylaxis with no fungi recovered from intraoperative culture. however, 2 of the 14 patients who did not receive empiric therapy had isolates that were positive for fungi. five patients who required an urgent operation for sepsis had pathogenic isolates that were similar to those recovered from central lines. postoperative infections occurred in 40 of 225 patients (17.8%) who had an elective pancreatic resection, with 72 pathogenic isolates being recovered. of these 40 patients, 22 (55.0%) had polymicrobial infections. of the 72 pathogenic  isolates recovered from patients, 34 (47.2%) were gram-positive organisms, 15 (20.8%) were fungal organisms, and 17 (23.6%) were drug-resistant bacteria. conclusions: prolonged vancomycin use in patients with severe acute pancreatitis  is associated with the acquisition of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. empiric antifungal therapy may reduce the incidence of secondary fungal pancreatic infections. systemic bloodstream infections at extrapancreatic sites can lead to  seeding of pancreatic pseudocysts. postoperative infections frequently include gram-positive, fungal, and drug-resistant organisms, and empiric therapy directed at these pathogens should be utilized until definitive culture results are obtained.

TI  == [trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in romania. experience of participation in earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system), 2002-2008].
AB  == earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial  resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and csf), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: s. aureus, e. coli, e. faecium/faecalis,  str. pneumoniae, ps. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae. romania reported data to earss since 2002 so far. though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for earss. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. this issue is related to the particular position of romania in the european  context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the  indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. during the 2002-2008 interval, romania reported to earss a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 s aureus, 369 e. coli, 128 streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 enterococcus spp.. 71 klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 pseudomonas aeruginosa. klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the  earss protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. it is difficult to describe trends, specially in enterococcus, streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in  invasive isolates is a real problem in romanian hospitals, like in other central, southern and south eastern european countries: more than 25% of s. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.

TI  == n-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines are a new class of bacterial dna gyrase inhibitors.
AB  == this paper characterizes n-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines (gyramides) as dna gyrase inhibitors. gyramide a was previously shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity that suggested it inhibited bacterial cell division. in this study, we conducted target identification studies and identified dna gyrase as the primary  target of gyramide a. the gyramide a resistance-determining region in dna gyrase  is adjacent to the dna cleavage gate and is a new site for inhibitor design. we studied the antibiotic effects of gyramides a-c in combination with the gram-negative efflux pump inhibitor mc-207,110 (60 mum). the gyramides had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 10-40 mum against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae; the compounds were ineffective against enterococcus faecalis. the ic(50) of gyramides a-c against e. coli dna gyrase was 0.7- 3.3 mum. the n-benzyl-3-sulfonamidopyrrolidines described in this manuscript represent a starting point for development of antibiotics that bind a new site in dna gyrase.

TI  == acquisition of vanb-type vancomycin resistance by bacillus subtilis: the impact on gene expression, cell wall composition and morphology.
AB  == the vancomycin resistance operons from enterococci, staphylococci and actinomycetes encode a vanrs two-component signal transduction system (tcs) and a suite of enzymes to modify the peptidoglycan biosynthetic precursor lipid ii and  to eliminate the d-ala-d-ala from the cell. commingling of these regulatory and enzymatic activities with host functions has the potential to significantly impact host gene expression and cell wall metabolism. here we report the effects  of individually expressing the vanr(b) s(b) tcs and the vany(b) wh(b) bx(b) resistance proteins in bacillus subtilis. vany(b) wh(b) bx(b) expression confers  resistance to 2 microg ml(-1) of vancomycin with concomitant reduced van-fl staining and leads to a cell division defect. in contrast to e. faecalis and s. aureus, vans(b) is active in b. subtilis without vancomycin addition. individual  expression of the vanr(b) s(b) tcs and the vany(b) wh(b) bx(b) resistance proteins repress and increase, respectively, expression of phopr regulon genes in the phosphate-limited state. when vancomycin-resistant cells are exposed to elevated vancomycin levels, mutant strains with increased resistance to vancomycin and a growth dependency on vany(b) wh(b) bx(b) expression frequently arise. mutation of the endogenous ddl ligase is the necessary and sufficient cause of both phenotypes. we discuss how these effects may influence establishment of van operons in new host bacteria.

AB  == during the last few years, insufficient efficacy of currently recommended antimicrobial agents has been observed, mainly in the case of glycopeptides, during the treatment of infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, even if these isolates show mic values within the susceptible range. the  phenomena associated with this observation are tolerance (a genetic event in which a bactericidal antibiotic fails to kill a bacterial population), persistence (a non-inherited and transient phenotypic phenomenon in which a bacterial subpopulation -0.1%-10%- survive lethal antimicrobial concentrations irrespective of the mechanisms of action) and heteroresistance (an epigenetic event in which less susceptible isogenic subpopulations are recovered when the entire population is challenged with concentrations exceeding mic values). new antimicrobials, including daptomycin, are less affected by these phenomena and should be considered as the treatment of choice when these events are demonstrated or suspected.

TI  == the challenges of antimicrobial resistance in brazil.
AB  == brazil is a country with continental proportions with high geographic and economic diversity. despite its medical centers of excellence, antimicrobial resistance poses a major therapeutic challenge. rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus are up to 60% and are related to an endemic brazilian clone. local resistance to vancomycin in enterococci was first related to enterococcus faecalis, which differs from european and american epidemiology. also, local klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have a much higher prevalence (40%-50% and 10%-18%, respectively). carbapenem resistance among the enterobacteriaceae group  is becoming a major problem, and k. pneumoniae carbapenemase isolates have been reported in different states. among nonfermenters, carbapenem resistance is strongly related to spm-1 (pseudomonasaeruginosa) and oxa-23 (acinetobacter baumannii complex) enzymes, and a colistin-only susceptible phenotype has also emerged in these isolates, which is worrisome. local actions without loosing the  global resistance perspective will demand multidisciplinary actions, new policies, and political engagement.

AB  == the purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether adding silver-zeolite (sz) to mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) would enhance the antimicrobial activity of mta against staphylococcus aureus (atcc #25923), enterococcus faecalis (atcc #29212), escherichia coli (atcc#25922), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc #27853), candida albicans (atcc #90028), porphyromonas gingivalis (atcc #33277), actinomyces israelii (atcc #12102), and prevotella intermedia (atcc# 15032). sz was added at 0.2% and 2% mass fraction concentration to mta powder. the control group was mta powder with no sz. the antimicrobial effect test was accomplished by placing freshly mixed mta specimens on agar plates inoculated with microorganisms and comparing the zones of inhibition at 24, 48, and 72 h. the amounts of silver ion release from mta specimens were measured with atomic absorption spectrophotometry at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. the ph of mta specimens was measured with a ph meter at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. mta with 2% and 0.2% sz specimens showed inhibitory effects on some microorganisms at all time periods, whereas no antimicrobial activity showed for p. intermedia and  a. israelii. mta without sz inhibited c. albicans, e. coli, and p. intermedia. the highest silver release was detected in 2% sz mta at 24 h. the incorporation of sz may enhance the antimicrobial activity of mta.

TI  == urine cultures from indwelling bladder catheters in nursing home patients: a point prevalence study in a swedish county.
AB  == objectives: to survey the bacterial flora and antibiotic resistance in urinary strains from patients with indwelling bladder catheters residing in nursing homes within a geographically defined region. material and methods: urine was sampled for culture from 163 catheter patients (126 men and 37 women) during a 2 week period in march 2010. susceptibility testing of the isolated bacteria was compared with all urinary strains (n = 9994) from hospitals and primary healthcare in the same geographical area cultured during the first 6 months of 2010 (control group). results: bacteriuria was found in 159 of 163 urine samples  (98%). enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli were the most common species, one or both being detected in 72% of the urine samples, while proteus species were found in10% and a single isolate of providentia species was seen.strains in  the study patients were more resistant to antibiotics than in the control group.  particularly large differences were noted for ciprofloxacinin in e. coli (16.9% vs 7.9%) and for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in e. faecalis (39.1% vs 24.8%). one extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing e. coli was cultured (1.3%), compared with 1.6% in the control group. no vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were detected. conclusions: proteus mirabilis and providentia species were rarely isolated, in sharp contrast to previous studies from geriatric hospital wards where they have often been in the majority. the limited incidence of esbl and the absence of vre and mrsa is gratifying, but the high resistance to antibiotics needs to be assessed on a continuous basis.

TI  == evaluating the in-vitro antibacterial effect of iranian propolis on oral microorganisms.
AB  == propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal  and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. there have been few studies on the effects of iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. in this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of tehran was evaluated. susceptibility  of the oral strains tested (streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 9222; staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis atcc 9854 and lactobacillus casei atcc 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/ml of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at different concentrations of propolis. the ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with mic and mbc ranges of 250-500 microg/ml. the mic concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/ml against s. mutans and e. faecalis. the water extract showed bactericidal activity only against s. mutans (20 mg/ml). these results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. however, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.

TI  == spectrum of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias after liver transplantation: implications for management.
AB  == bacteremia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. the characterization of the microbiological spectrum of bacteremia after liver transplantation may help physicians in choosing the initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients presenting with sepsis. the  clinical and microbiology records of patients who received liver transplantation  from january 1997 to march 2006 were reviewed. one hundred twenty-three of the 737 liver recipients (16.7%) developed bacteremia during the median follow-up period of 5.8 years (interquartile range = 2.5-8.8 years); 92 patients (12.5%) had gram-positive bacteremia (gpb), whereas 47 (6.4%) had gram-negative bacteremia (gnb). nosocomial bacteremia was significantly more frequent among patients with early-onset gpb or gnb versus patients with late-onset gpb (66.7% versus 23.7%, p < 0.001) or gnb (70.6% versus 20.0%, p = 0.001). peritonitis (33.3% versus 7.9%, p = 0.004) and wound infections (13.0% versus 0%, p = 0.04) as sources were more common in patients with early-onset gpb versus patients with late-onset gpb. likewise, peritonitis was a more common source of early-onset gnb than late-onset gnb (41.2% versus 6.7%, p = 0.007). staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset  gpb, whereas enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus species were most common in  patients with late-onset gpb. pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobes were the most  common pathogens in patients with early-onset gnb, whereas escherichia coli was most common in patients with late-onset gnb. in conclusion, the microbiological spectra of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias differ, and this should be considered by those determining the initial empirical treatment of liver transplant recipients suspected to have bacteremias.

TI  == need for improved antimicrobial and infection control stewardship in vietnamese intensive care units.
AB  == objective: survey of antibiotic consumption, microbial resistance and hygiene precautions in the intensive care units of three hospitals in northern vietnam. methods: observational study. data were collected from the microbiological laboratories. antibiotic consumption was determined based on quantities of drugs  delivered from the pharmacy. a protocol to observe the application of hygiene precautions was developed and used. bacteria were typed and tested for drug susceptibility using the disc-diffusion method. results: the mean antibiotic consumption was 811 defined daily doses per 1000 occupied bed days. the most commonly used antibiotics were third-generation cephalosporins, followed by carbapenems, amoxicillin and ampicillin. eighty per cent of bacterial isolates were gram-negative. the most common pathogens found in blood cultures were escherichia coli and klebsiella spp., pseudomonas spp., acinetobacter spp., staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. acinetobacter and pseudomonas spp. were the two most frequently isolated bacteria from the respiratory tract and all other sources together. seventy per cent of acinetobacter species showed  reduced susceptibility to imipenem, 80% to ciprofloxacin and 89% to ceftazidime.  forty-four per cent of pseudomonas spp. showed reduced susceptibility to imipenem, 49% to ciprofloxacin and 49% to ceftazidime. escherichia coli was fully susceptible to imipenem, but 57% of samples were resistant to both ciprofloxacin  and cefotaxime. hygiene precautions were poor, and fewer than 50% of patient contacts incorporated appropriate hand hygiene. conclusion: low antibiotic consumption, poor hygiene precautions and the high level of antibiotic resistance indicate that there is room for improvement regarding antibiotic use and infection control.

TI  == relative roles of the cellular and humoral responses in the drosophila host defense against three gram-positive bacterial infections.
AB  == background: two nf-kappab signaling pathways, toll and immune deficiency (imd), are required for survival to bacterial infections in drosophila. in response to septic injury, these pathways mediate rapid transcriptional activation of distinct sets of effector molecules, including antimicrobial peptides, which are  important components of a humoral defense response. however, it is less clear to  what extent macrophage-like hemocytes contribute to host defense. methodology/principal findings: in order to dissect the relative importance of humoral and cellular defenses after septic injury with three different gram-positive bacteria (micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus), we used latex bead pre-injection to ablate macrophage function in flies  wildtype or mutant for various toll and imd pathway components. we found that in  all three infection models a compromised phagocytic system impaired fly survival--independently of concomitant toll or imd pathway activation. our data failed to confirm a role of the pgrp-sa and gnbp1 pattern recognition receptors for phagocytosis of s. aureus. the drosophila scavenger receptor eater mediates the phagocytosis by hemocytes or s2 cells of e. faecalis and s. aureus, but not of m. luteus. in the case of m. luteus and e. faecalis, but not s. aureus, decreased survival due to defective phagocytosis could be compensated for by genetically enhancing the humoral immune response. conclusions/significance: our  results underscore the fundamental importance of both cellular and humoral mechanisms in drosophila immunity and shed light on the balance between these two arms of host defense depending on the invading pathogen.

TI  == [epidemic hazard of water use in the reactivation of bacteria after disinfection].
AB  == variability in the cultural and biochemical properties of indicator, opportunistic, and pathogenic bacteria and possibilities of their reactivation after exposure to chlorine-containing reagents and during photo-activated disinfection processes in the presence of photosensitizes were experimentally studied to enhance the epidemic reliability and adequacy of microbiological monitoring in the evaluation of the decontamination efficiency of water of its various use types. reactivation of coliform bacteria, enterococci, salmonellas, and the total number of microbes were estimated after exposure to the bacteriostatic doses of sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide when the river and waste waters were decontaminated. during photo-activated disinfection under the action of the photosensitizers methylene blue and proflavin acetate given in  the bacteriostatic doses, there was transition into the uncultivated state, followed by 1-5-day reactivation of both museum strains and strains isolated from waste waters, such as salmonella infantis spp, salmonella enteritidis spp, salmonella enteritidis 5765 atcc, pseudomonas aeruginosa 10145, pseudomonas aeruginosa spp, escherichia coli 1257, staphylococcus aureus 906, and enterococcus faecalis 29212. moreover, pseudomonas and salmonellas not only regained their viability, but also multiplied up to the control level. recommendations are given how to improve methods for monitoring the efficiency of disinfection, by taking into account a possible variability in the cultural and biochemical properties of bacteria and for reactivation by monitoring the trend in the process during 5 days.

TI  == purification of a lectin with antibacterial activity from bothrops leucurus snake venom.
AB  == a novel lectin was isolated from bothrops leucurus snake venom using a combination of affinity and gel filtration chromatographies. the lectin (bll) agglutinated glutaraldehyde-treated rabbit and human erythrocytes with preference for rabbit erythrocytes. galactose, raffinose, lactose, fetal bovine serum and casein inhibited lectin-induced rabbit erythrocyte agglutination. bll, with a molecular mass of 30 kda and composed of two subunits of 15 kda, showed dependence on calcium. bll is an acidic protein with highest activity over the ph range of 4.0-7.0 and stable under heating to 70 degrees c. fluorescence emission  spectra showed tryptophan residues partially buried within the lectin structure.  the percentages of secondary structure revealed by circular dichroism were 1% alpha-helix, 44% beta-sheet, 24% beta-turn and 31% unordered. bll showed effective antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and bacillus subtilis with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 31.25, 62.25 and 125 mug/ml, respectively. in conclusion, b. leucurus snake venom contains a galactoside-binding lectin with antibacterial activity.

TI  == use of daptomycin in complicated cases of infective endocarditis.
AB  == infective endocarditis (ie) is a serious form of infection with a high mortality. medical management can be a challenge because of organ dysfunction, lack of clinical response or allergy to the recommended antibiotics. daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with a potent bactericidal activity against gram-positive  bacteria. there are limited data on the use of daptomycin in complicated cases of ie. we aim to report our experience of daptomycin use in complicated cases of ie  through a prospective observational study (from 1 october 2008 to 30 september 2009). daptomycin was prescribed for cases that were either unresponsive or allergic to the standard therapy. clinical characteristics and outcomes were reviewed. success was defined as clinical improvement accompanied with the resolution of laboratory markers of sepsis and continuation of the above findings for at least 8 weeks after the end of therapy. eight cases were evaluable. native and prosthetic valves were involved in equal proportions. the range of organisms  was wide: staphylococcus aureus, two cases; s. epidermidis, two cases; streptococci, two cases; and enterococcus faecalis, two cases. the median duration of therapy was 42 days. all patients were successfully treated. daptomycin was well tolerated. daptomycin is useful in the management of complicated cases of ie.

TI  == transcriptome, proteome, and metabolite analyses of a lactate dehydrogenase-negative mutant of enterococcus faecalis v583.
AB  == a constructed lactate dehydrogenase (ldh)-negative mutant of enterococcus faecalis v583 grows at the same rate as the wild type but ferments glucose to ethanol, formate, and acetoin. microarray analysis showed that ldh deficiency had profound transcriptional effects: 43 genes in the mutant were found to be upregulated, and 45 were found to be downregulated. most of the upregulated genes encode enzymes of energy metabolism or transport. by two-dimensional (2d) gel analysis, 45 differentially expressed proteins were identified. a comparison of transcriptomic and proteomic data suggested that for several proteins the level of expression is regulated beyond the level of transcription. pyruvate catabolic  genes, including the truncated ldh gene, showed highly increased transcription in the mutant. these genes, along with a number of other differentially expressed genes, are preceded by sequences with homology to binding sites for the global redox-sensing repressor, rex, of staphylococcus aureus. the data indicate that the genes are transcriptionally regulated by the nadh/nad ratio and that this ratio plays an important role in the regulatory network controlling energy metabolism in e. faecalis.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of ceftobiprole against clinical isolates from french teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  == the aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial  pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints. mics of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight french hospitals. disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the comite de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie (ca-sfm). the in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by mic(50/90) (mics for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/l), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant cons, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; enterococcus faecalis,  0.25/1; enterococcus faecium, 64/128; enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. according to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for mics of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/l respectively. in conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many gram-positive bacteria, including mrsa but not e. faecium, whilst maintaining a gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == evaluation of three swab transport systems for the maintenance of clinically important bacteria in simulated mono- and polymicrobial samples.
AB  == in this study, three swab transport systems were evaluated: m40 transystem, amies broth with a relatively new type of swab (both copan diagnostics, corona, ca, usa), and ssi transportmedium (statens serum institut, copenhagen denmark). the clsi m40-a standard procedures and 11 culture collection strains were used. the transport systems were tested at room temperature for holding times of 0, 24, and 48 h, and both mono- and polymicrobial samples were included. after 24 h of simulated transportation, all systems were able to maintain the viability of all  organisms tested. ssi transportmedium exhibited the lowest maintaining ability, whereas the two copan systems were the most growth-promoting system. in polymicrobial samples, this latter feature was a problem. at 48 h, no transport system could maintain the viability of all strains, and the recovery rates differed depending on organism and device. the species most difficult to recover  in all the three systems was neisseria gonorrhoeae. when selecting a swab transport system, consideration must be given to the sample type, the conditions  that prevail locally, and the performance in the clinical setting.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis virulence regulator fsra binding to target promoters.
AB  == the fsrabdc signal transduction system is a major virulence regulator in enterococcus faecalis. the fsrc sensor histidine kinase, upon activation by the gelatinase biosynthesis-activating pheromone (gbap) peptide encoded by the fsrbd  genes, phosphorylates the fsra response regulator required for the transcription  of the fsrbdc and the gele-spre genes from the fsrb promoter and the gele promoter, respectively. fsra belongs to the lyttr family of proteins, which includes other virulence regulators, such as agra of staphylococcus aureus, algr  of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and virr of clostridium perfringens. the lyttr dna-binding domain that characterizes these proteins generally binds to two imperfect direct repeats separated by a number of bases that place the repeats on the same face of the dna helix. in this study, we demonstrated that fsra also binds to two imperfect direct repeats separated by 13 bp, based on the consensus  sequence of fsra, t/at/caa/gggaa/g, which is consistent with the binding characteristics of lyttr domains.

AB  == in the recent years, the number of drug- and multi-drug-resistant microbial strains has increased rapidly. therefore, the need to identify innovative approaches for development of novel anti-infectives and new therapeutic targets is of high priority in global health care. the detection of small rnas (srnas) in bacteria has attracted considerable attention as an emerging class of new gene expression regulators. several experimental technologies to predict srna have been established for the gram-negative model organism escherichia coli. in many respects, srna screens in this model system have set a blueprint for the global and functional identification of srnas for gram-positive microbes, but the functional role of srnas in colonization and pathogenicity for listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile is almost completely unknown. here, we report  the current knowledge about the srnas of these socioeconomically relevant gram-positive pathogens, overview the state-of-the-art high-throughput srna screening methods and summarize bioinformatics approaches for genome-wide srna identification and target prediction. finally, we discuss the use of modified peptide nucleic acids (pnas) as a novel tool to inactivate potential srna and their applications in rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  == acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. the main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of suprathel (polymedics innovations gmbh, denkendorf, germany) in combination with  various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii, or pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. the study  was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [hibicet]). as a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive  bacteria strains were tested: escherichia coli, p vulgaris, p aeruginosa, a baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups a and b. the tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p vulgaris, p aeruginosa, and a baumannii, except for the combination of  suprathel and mafenide acetate. it can be concluded that suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. the authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. the combination of  suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.

TI  == entianin, a novel subtilin-like lantibiotic from bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii dsm 15029t with high antimicrobial activity.
AB  == lantibiotics, such as nisin and subtilin, are lanthionine-containing peptides that exhibit antimicrobial as well as pheromone-like autoinducing activity. autoinduction is specific for each lantibiotic, and reporter systems for nisin and subtilin autoinduction are available. in this report, we used the previously  reported subtilin autoinduction bioassay in combination with mass spectrometric analyses to identify the novel subtilin-like lantibiotic entianin from bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii dsm 15029(t). linearization of entianin using raney nickel-catalyzed reductive cleavage enabled, for the first time, the use of tandem mass spectrometry for the fast and efficient determination of an entire lantibiotic primary structure, including posttranslational modifications. the amino acid sequence determined was verified by dna sequencing of the etns structural gene, which confirmed that entianin differs from subtilin at 3 amino acid positions. in contrast to b. subtilis atcc 6633, which produces only small amounts of unsuccinylated subtilin, b. subtilis dsm 15029(t) secretes considerable amounts of unsuccinylated entianin. entianin was very active against several gram-positive pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. the growth-inhibiting activity of succinylated entianin (s-entianin) was much lower than that of unsuccinylated entianin: a 40-fold higher concentration was required for inhibition. for succinylated subtilin (s-subtilin), a concentration 100-fold higher than that of unsuccinylated entianin was required to inhibit the growth of a b. subtilis test strain. this finding was in accordance with a strongly reduced sensing of cellular envelope stress provided by s-entianin relative to that of entianin. remarkably, s-entianin and s-subtilin showed considerable autoinduction activity, clearly demonstrating that autoinduction and antibiotic activity underlie different molecular mechanisms.

AB  == in last decade methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus with high level of vancomycin-resistance (vrsa) have been reported and generally the patients with vrsa infection were also infected with a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre). considering that the high level of vancomycin-resistance in vrsa isolates seems to involve the horizontal transfer of tn1546 transposon containing vana gene from coinfecting vre strains, the authors have studied the "in vitro" conjugative transfer of this resistance from vana enterococci to s. aureus. out of 25 matings performed combining five vancomycin-resistant enterococci as donors (three enterococcus faecalis and two enterococcus faecium), and five s. aureus as recipients, all clinical isolates, two have been successful using e. faecalis as  donor. the transfer of vancomycin-resistance was confirmed by vana gene amplification in both transconjugants and the resistance was expressed at lower levels (mic 32 mug/ml) in comparison with the respective vre donors (mic > 128 mug/ml). the vancomycin-resistance of trasconjugants was maintained even after subsequent overnight passages on msa plates containing subinhibitory levels of vancomycin. this study shows that the vana gene transfer can be achieved through  techniques "in vitro" without the use of laboratory animals employed, in the only similar experiment previously carried out by other authors, as substrate for the  trasconjugant growth. moreover, in that previous experiment, contrary to this study, the vancomycin resistant s. aureus trasconjugants were selected on erythromycin agar and not by direct vancomycin agar selection.

TI  == prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern nigeria.
AB  == enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. the aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in osogbo, nigeria. the study was conducted between january and june 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of enterococcus species at the  bacteriology laboratory of ladoke akintola university of technology, osogbo using standard microbiological methods. there were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (hai); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. two species of enterococcus were identified; enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection  (uti) and surgical site infection (ssi) of 6 (85.7%) patients and enterococcus faecium from uti in 1 (14.3%) patient. other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were klebsiella spp 31.0%, pseudomonas spp 20.7%, staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, escherichia coli 12.1%, staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and serratia spp 1.7%. all the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) with the vre strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. other gram-positive and gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except e. coli and pseudomonas spp which  were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. this limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci  infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. there is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and  rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.

TI  == ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. experimental study.
AB  == introduction: bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. ozone  therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. the action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. material and methods: we decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the ozonytron device (made by biozonix) on model strains of streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and  agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. results: we found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all  media depending on the time of action of ozone. in the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. what is more, two models  of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. conclusion: research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.

AB  == the present study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of three root canal irrigants against enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, and staphylococcus aureus. these microorganisms were incubated in the presence of citric acid (6 and 10%), edta (17%), and naocl (0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.25%). agar diffusion tests were performed and redox indicator resazurin was used to evaluate the inhibitory effect of the irrigants on the metabolic activity of these microorganisms. the mean diameters of the inhibition zones for the c. albicans cultures were 11.6 mm  (17% edta), 5.5 mm (0.5% naocl), 12.9 mm (1% naocl), 22.1 mm (2.5% naocl), and 28.5 mm (5.25% naocl). the mean diameters of the inhibition zones for e. faecalis were 2.8 mm (1% naocl), 5.4 mm (2.5% naocl), and 8.3 mm (5.25% naocl). for s. aureus, the mean values were 8.0 mm (17% edta), 3.0 mm (1% naocl), 8.8 mm (2.5% naocl), and 10.0 mm (5.25% naocl). most of the irrigant solutions presented effective antimicrobial activity against c. albicans. a high inhibitory effect on the metabolic activity of e. faecalis was detected when the microorganisms were incubated with 17% edta. the same result was reached when s. aureus was incubated in the presence of > 2.5% naocl. altogether, these results indicate that 2.5% and 5.25% naocl are microbicides against s. aureus while 0.5% and 1% naocl are only microbiostatic against the tested bacteria. the 6% and 10% citric acid as well as 17% edta did not affect the viability of any of the assayed microorganisms.

TI  == [chlorhexidine as a root canal irrigant--antimicrobial and scanning electron microscopic evaluation].
AB  == introduction: selection of irrigant is very important for long-term success of root canal therapy. objective: this study was undertaken to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of 2% chlorhexidine digluconate solution (chx) against five selected microorganisms and to evaluate its efficacy in root canal cleaning. methods: in this study, by agar diffusion test, were evaluated antimicrobial effects of three root canal irrigants: 5.25% naocl, 2.5% naocl and 2% chx. the microorganisms tested in this study were staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and candida albicans. a scanning  electron microscope was used to evaluate root canal cleaning ability of 5.25% naocl, 2.5% naocl, 2% chx and 15% edta. twelve extracted single-root human teeth  were divided into four groups depending on the irrigant used during instrumentation. mechanical preparation was performed with step back technique and k files. data were analysed statistically by student's t-test. results: 5.25% naocl was the most effective against all tested microorganisms. 2.5% naocl and 2% chx showed antimicrobial effects against all tested microorganisms but zones of inhibition were smaller.the best results in root canal walls cleaning were obtained in the group where the irrigant was 15% edta (score 2.33). in 5.25% naocl, 2.5% naocl and 2% chx groups, there was more smear layer (score 4 and 5).  conclusion: 2% chlorhexidine digluconate showed strong antimicrobial effect on the tested microorganisms, but was not effective in cleaning root canal walls.

TI  == effects of demethylfruticuline a and fruticuline a from salvia corrugata vahl. on biofilm production in vitro by multiresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == in this study, demethylfruticuline a (dfa) and fruticuline a (fa), two quinones representing the major diterpenoid components of the exudate produced by the aerial parts of salvia corrugata, were assessed for their ability to modify surface characteristics, such as hydrophobicity, and to inhibit synthesis of biofilm in vitro by multiresistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis. five strains of s. aureus (three meticillin-resistant and two meticillin-susceptible), five strains of s. epidermidis (four meticillin-resistant and one meticillin-susceptible) and eight  vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, all recently isolated from clinical specimens and capable of slime production, were studied. fa decrease by at least two-fold the hydrophobic properties of the s. aureus cell membrane but did not affect s. epidermidis or e. faecalis. biofilm formation on polystyrene plates was quantified spectrophotometrically by established methodologies. inhibition of biofilm formation was also confirmed by the congo red agar plate assay. dfa and fa were more effective against s. aureus strains (>70% effect at subinhibitory concentrations) than against s. epidermidis in inhibiting slime synthesis. against e. faecalis, dfa at subinhibitory concentration induced an inhibition of  biofilm production of ca. 60%; fa was less active and more strain-dependent. moreover, the two compounds were shown to possess chelating activity on divalent  and trivalent metal cations. interactions of fa and dfa with bacteria could be very complex, possibly being species-specific, and could depend not only on inhibition of exopolysaccharide synthesis but also on their chelating activity and on changes in the microorganism's surface, including cell hydrophobicity.

TI  == chitosan-cobalt(ii) and nickel(ii) chelates as antibacterial agents.
AB  == antibacterial behavior of chitosan-bivalent metal chelates (co and ni) was investigated in vitro against standard bacteria, staphylococcus aureus atcc 4533, s. faecalis atcc 8043 and escherichia coli atcc 25923. the chitosan-metal chelates were prepared by varying the molar ratio of metal ions to a fixed amount of chitosan. the metal ion contents, structural properties and morphology of the  chelates were respectively determined using icp-oes, ft-ir and sem. all the chitosan-metal chelates showed wide spectrum of effective antibacterial activities better than free chitosan and the individual metal ions. the results indicated that inhibitory effects of the chelates were dependent not only on the  property of the coordinated metal ion, but also on the molar ratio of the metal ion. consequently, the ideal inhibitory effects could be obtained with metal ion  of high charge intensity and when the molar ratio of chitosan to metal was above  1:1. these chelates are promising materials for novel antibacterial agents.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity study of a novel class of cationic anthraquinone analogs.
AB  == reported previously by our group, one-pot cycloaddition using naphthoquinone, sodium azide and alkyl halides can lead to the formation of both 1-alkyl-1h- and  2-alkyl-2h-naphtho[2,3-d]triazole-4,9-diones. herein, the effect of leaving group and additive in dictating the selectivity between the formation of 1-alkyl-1h- and 2-alkyl-2h-naphtho[2,3-d]triazole-4,9-diones has been further investigated. in the process of investigating the factors that control the selectivity and the  biological activity associated with these two compounds, a novel class of antibacterial cationic anthraquinone analogs has been developed. although these compounds are structurally similar, different antibacterial profiles are noted. one lead compound, 4e manifests high potency (mic<1mug/ml) and selectivity against gram positive (g+) pathogens including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) while exerting only modest activity against gram negative (g-) bacteria. other lead compounds (4f and 4g) exhibit broad antibacterial activity including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre) that is comparable to other commercially available cationic antiseptic chemicals. this unique difference in antibacterial profile may pave the way for the development of new therapeutic agents.

TI  == characterization of lytic enzyme open reading frame 9 (orf9) derived from enterococcus faecalis bacteriophage phief24c.
AB  == in bacteriophage (phage) therapy against gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis, members of a genus of spo1-like viruses are typically employed because of their extreme virulence and broad host spectrum. phage phief24c, which is a spo1-like virus infecting e. faecalis, has previously been characterized as a therapeutic phage candidate. in addition to the phage itself, phage endolysin is also recognized as an effective antimicrobial agent. in this study, a putative endolysin gene (orf9) of e. faecalis phage phief24c was analyzed in silico, and its activity was characterized using the recombinant form. first, bioinformatics analysis predicted that the open reading frame 9 (orf9) protein is n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase. second, bacteriolytic and bactericidal activities of orf9 against e. faecalis were confirmed by zymography, decrease of  peptidoglycan turbidity, decrease of the viable count, and morphological analysis of orf9-treated cells. third, orf9 did not appear to require zn(2+) ions for its  activity, contrary to the bioinformatics prediction of a zn(2+) ion requirement.  fourth, the lytic spectrum was from 97.1% (34 out of 35 strains, including vancomycin-resistant strains) of e. faecalis strains to 60% (6 out of 10 strains) of enterococcus faecium strains. fifth, n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase activity of orf9 was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and the subsequent maldi-postsource decay (psd) analyses. finally, functional analysis using n- or c-terminally deleted orf9 mutants suggested that a complete orf9 molecule is essential for its activity. these results suggested that orf9 is an endolysin of  phage phief24c and can be a therapeutic alternative to antibiotics.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of telavancin studied in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model of infection.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of telavancin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin against six  staphylococcus aureus strains (1 methicillin-susceptible s. aureus [mssa] strain, 4 methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa] strains, and 1 vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus [visa] strain) and three enterococcus sp. strains (1 enterococcus faecalis strain, 1 enterococcus faecium strain, and 1 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium [vref] strain) were compared using an in vitro pharmacokinetic model of infection. analyzing the data from all five vancomycin-susceptible s. aureus (vssa) strains or all 4 mrsa strains showed that telavancin was superior in its antibacterial effect as measured by the area under the bacterial kill curve at 24 h (aubkc(24)) and 48 h (aubkc(48)) in comparison to vancomycin or teicoplanin (p  < 0.05). telavancin was also superior to vancomycin and teicoplanin in terms of its greater early killing effect (p < 0.05). against the three enterococcus spp.  tested, telavancin was superior to vancomycin in terms of its aubkc(24), aubkc(48), and greater early bactericidal effect (p < 0.05). dose-ranging studies were performed to provide free-drug area under the concentration-time curve over  24 h in the steady state divided by the mic (fauc/mic) exposures from 0 to 1,617  (7 to 14 exposures per strain) for 5 vssa, 4 visa, and the 3 enterococcus strains. the fauc/mic values for a 24-h bacteriostatic effect and a 1-log-unit drop in the viable count were 43.1 +/- 38.4 and 50.0 +/- 39.0 for vssa, 3.2 +/- 1.3 and 4.3 +/- 1.3 for visa, and 15.1 +/- 8.8 and 40.1 +/- 29.4 for the enterococcus spp., respectively. the reason for the paradoxically low fauc/mic values for visa strains is unknown. there was emergence of resistance to telavancin in the dose-ranging studies, as indicated by subpopulations able to grow on plates containing 2x mic telavancin concentrations compared to the preexposure population analysis profiles. changes in population analysis profiles were less likely with enterococci than with s. aureus, and the greatest risk of changed profiles occurred for both species at fauc/mic ratios of 1 to 10. maintaining a fauc/mic ratio of >50 reduced the risk of subpopulations able to grow on antibiotic-containing media emerging. these data help explain the clinical effectiveness of telavancin against mrsa and indicate that telavancin may have clinically useful activity against enterococcus spp., and perhaps also visa, at human doses of 10 mg/kg of body weight/day. in addition, they support a  clinical breakpoint of sensitive at </=1 mg/liter for both s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

AB  == visible light-absorbing cationic water-soluble gallium(iii) phthalocyanines (gapcs) peripherally substituted with four and eight methylpyridyloxy groups were synthesized and investigated as antimicrobial photodynamic sensitizers. the inserted large gallium ion in the phthalocyanine ligand is axially substituted by one hydroxyl group which prevents aggregation of the complexes in aqueous solution. the cellular uptake and the photodynamic activity for the representative strains of the gram positive bacteria methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus(mrsa) and enterococcus faecalis, of the gram negative bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa and of the fungus candida albicans in planktonic phase were studied. the tetra-methylpyridyloxy substituted gapc1 showed lower cellular uptake compared to the octa-methylpyridyloxy substituted gapc2. the photodynamic activity of the gapcs was studied in comparison to methylene blue (mb) and a photodynamically active zn(ii)-phthalocyanine with the same substitution (znpcme). photodynamic treatment with 3.0 mum gapc1 at mild light conditions (50 j cm(-2), 60 mw cm(-2)) resulted in a high photoinactivation of the microorganisms in the planktonic phase nevertheless the dark toxicity of gapc1 towards mrsa and e. faecalis. gapcs against fungal biofilm grown on polymethylmethacrylate (pmmc) resin showed a complete inactivation at a higher concentration of gapc2 (6.0 mum) and of the referent sensitizer znpcme. however,  the bacterial biofilms were not susceptible to treatment of gapcs with only 1-2 log reduction of the biofilm. the bacterial biofilm e. faecalis was effectively inactivated only with mb. the water-soluble octa-methylpyridyloxy substituted gapc2 has a potential value for photodynamic treatment of c. albicans biofilms formed on denture acrylic resin.

TI  == anti-bacterial activity of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy: comparative in vitro study of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, mefloquine,  and azithromycin.
AB  == background: intermittent preventive treatment of malaria with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (sp) is recommended for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy in sub-saharan africa. increasing drug resistance necessitates the urgent evaluation of alternative drugs. currently, the most promising candidates  in clinical development are mefloquine and azithromycin. besides the anti-malarial activity, sp is also a potent antibiotic and incurs significant anti-microbial activity when given as iptp - though systematic clinical evaluation of this action is still lacking. methods: in this study, the intrinsic anti-bacterial activity of mefloquine and azithromycin was assessed in comparison to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine against bacterial pathogens with clinical importance in pregnancy in a standard microdilution assay. results: sp was highly active against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. all tested gram-positive bacteria, except enterococcus faecalis, were sensitive to azithromycin. additionally, azithromycin was active against neisseria gonorrhoeae. mefloquine showed good activity against pneumococci but lower in vitro action against all other tested pathogens. conclusion: these data indicate  important differences in the spectrum of anti-bacterial activity for the evaluated anti-malarial drugs. given the large scale use of iptp in africa, the need for prospective clinical trials evaluating the impact of antibiotic activity of anti-malarials on maternal and foetal health and on the risk of promoting specific drug resistance of bacterial pathogens is discussed.

TI  == myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. the present study provides direct evidence of mpo binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. the microbicidal effectiveness of h(2)o(2) and of ocl(-) was compared to that of mpo plus h(2)o(2). synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining streptococcus sanguinis, a h(2)o(2)-producing microbe showing low mpo binding, with high-mpo-binding escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous h(2)o(2), with and without mpo, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]). selectivity of mpo microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the mpo mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for 82 bacteria including e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. both h(2)o(2) and ocl(-) destroyed rbcs at submicrobicidal concentrations. nanomolar concentrations of mpo increased h(2)o(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. streptococci plus mpo produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and rbcs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. mpo directly killed h(2)o(2)-producing s. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-h(2)o(2)-producing e. faecalis. the mpo  mics and mbcs for e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were significantly lower  than those for e. faecalis. the streptococcal studies showed much higher mic/mbc  results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. e.  faecalis mpo binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. selective mpo binding results in selective killing.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite-based irrigating solutions.
AB  == purpose: the objective of the present study was the in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of three different naocl-based endodontic irrigating solutions: a 5.25% conventional sodium hypochlorite solution; and two new irrigating solutions, a 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution with the addition of a proteolytic enzyme and a surfactant; and a 5.25% sodium hypochlorite gel with inorganic silicate. methods: enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus mutans strains were selected to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the endodontic irrigating solutions by the agar disc diffusion test. paper disks were saturated with each one of the tested solutions (at room temperature and pre-warmed at 45 degrees c) and placed onto culture agar-plates pre-adsorbed  with bacterial cells and further incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees c. the growth inhibition zones around each irrigating solution were recorded and compared for each bacterial strain. results: the results were significantly different among the tested irrigating solutions: 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution produced the  highest inhibition areas; 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution with a proteolytic enzyme and a surfactant, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite gel with inorganic silicate showed the lowest zones of inhibition. conclusions: even if all tested irrigating solution possessed antibacterial activity versus all tested bacterial  strains, 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution with a proteolytic enzyme and a surfactant, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite gel with inorganic silicate showed lower in vitro efficacy than 5.25% conventional sodium hypochlorite solution.

TI  == chitosan-edta new combination is a promising candidate for treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.
AB  == chitosan is an attractive preparation widely used as a pharmaceutical excipient.  this study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of chitosan derivatives, edta, and the newly developed chitosan-edta combination against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as candida albicans. antimicrobial activity was studied. both minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic)  and minimal biocidal concentrations (mbc) were determined. chitosan acetic acid recorded lower mic values against enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans than those exhibited by edta. edta failed to have inhibitory activity against enterococcus faecalis as well as mbc against any of the studied microorganisms. chitosan acetic acid's mbc were recorded to all examined species. checkerboard assay results indicated a synergistic antimicrobial activity of the new combination against staphylococcus aureus and an additive effect against other microorganisms. moreover, a short microbial exposure to chitosan-edta (20-30 min) caused complete eradication. due to the continuous emergence of resistant strains, there is an urgent need to discover new antimicrobial agents. our findings suggest the use of chitosan as an enhancing agent with antibacterial and antifungal properties in combination with edta in pharmaceutical preparations.

TI  == elaboration of antibiofilm materials by chemical grafting of an antimicrobial peptide.
AB  == a peptide antibiotic, gramicidin a, was covalently bound to cystamine self-assembled monolayers on gold surfaces. each step of the surface functionalization was characterized by polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. the antimicrobial activity of the anchored gramicidin was tested against three gram-positive bacteria (listeria ivanovii, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus), the gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli and the yeast candida albicans. the results revealed that the adsorbed gramicidin reduced, from 60% for e. coli to 90% for c. albicans, the number of culturable microorganisms attached to the surface. the activity was proven to be persistent  overtime, up to 6 months after the first use. the bacteria attached to the functionalized surfaces were permeabilized as shown by confocal microscopy. taken together, these results indicate a bacteriostatic mode of action of the immobilized peptide. finally, using green fluorescent protein-expressing bacteria, it was shown that the development of a bacterial biofilm was delayed on peptide-grafted surfaces for at least 24 h.

TI  == synergism between maggot excretions and antibiotics.
AB  == maggots are successfully used to treat severe, infected wounds. this study investigated whether maggot excretions/secretions influence the antibacterial activity of different antibiotics. minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal  bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined of gentamicin and flucloxacillin for staphylococcus aureus, of penicillin for streptococcus pyogenes, of amoxicillin and vancomycin for enterococcus faecalis, of gentamicin  for enterobacter cloacae, and of gentamicin, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin for pseudomonas aeruginosa by checkerboard titration. a range of concentrations of antibiotics in combination with excretions/secretions was examined to investigate the potential of maggot excretions/secretions to affect antibacterial activity. the results showed a dose-dependent increase of the antibacterial effect of gentamicin in the presence of excretions/secretions on s. aureus. minimal concentrations and mbc of gentamicin decreased, respectively, 64- and 32-fold. the mbc of flucloxacillin and excretions/secretions against s. aureus were also decreased. the other antibiotic and excretions/secretions combinations exerted an indifferent effect. excretions/secretions alone did not have any antibacterial effect. the synergism between gentamicin and maggot excretions/secretions could be of direct importance in clinical practice, because it could allow the use of lower doses of gentamicin and thus minimize the risk of gentamicin-related side effects.

TI  == synergy of nitric oxide and silver sulfadiazine against gram-negative, gram-positive, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  == the synergistic activity between nitric oxide (no) released from diazeniumdiolate-modified proline (proli/no) and silver(i) sulfadiazine (agsd) was evaluated against escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis using a modified broth microdilution technique and a checkerboard-type assay. the combination of no and agsd was defined as synergistic when the fractional bactericidal concentration (fbc) was calculated to be <0.5. gram-negative species were generally more susceptible to the individual antimicrobial agents than the gram-positive bacteria, while gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to combination therapy. the in vitro synergistic activity of agsd and no observed against a range of pathogens strongly supports future investigation of this therapeutic combination, particularly for its potential use in the treatment of burns and chronic wounds.

TI  == in vivo and in vitro antibacterial activity of acanthospermal b, a sesquiterpene  lactone isolated from acanthospermum hispidum.
AB  == acanthospermal b (acb), the major sesquiterpene lactone (sl) of acanthospermum hispidum, an herb widely spread in argentina, is a selective antibacterial agent  against enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, but inactive on gram-negative and lactobacillus. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is one of the main microorganisms involved in human chronic infection. a balb\c mouse skin infection model was developed to reproduce the lesions caused by acute and chronic infections produced by mrsa. after determination of the maximum concentration of acb unable to produce tissular injury after intradermal  injection, the anti-mrsa effect of acb was evaluated on skin, liver and spleen tissues of infected mice. acb, at doses of 2.5 mg/kg, produced a ten times decrease of mrsa growth in skin infection. in addition, the same dose prevented the dissemination to liver and/or spleen. acb also displayed a bacteriostatic effect, in vitro, on mrsa cultures at 50 microg/ml that seems to be caused by partial denaturation of total bacterial dna and/or inhibition of the pcr reaction in not denaturized dna. finally, total mrsa cell wall lysis occurred at a concentration of 100 microg/ml of acb after 2 h of exposure.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of extracts from tamarindus indica l. leaves.
AB  == tamarindus indica l. leaves are reported worldwide as antibacterial and antifungal agents; however, this observation is not completely accurate in the case of cuba. in this article, decoctions from fresh and sun dried leaves, as well as fluid extracts prepared with 30 and 70% ethanol-water and the pure essential oil from tamarind leaves were microbiologically tested against bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomona aeruginosa and candida albicans. aqueous and fluid extracts were previously characterized by spectrophotometric determination  of their total phenols and flavonoids, while the essential oil was chemically evaluated by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (gc/ms). experimental data suggest phenols as active compounds against b. subtilis cultures, but not against other microorganisms. on the other hand, the essential oil exhibited a good antimicrobial spectrum when pure, but its relative low concentrations in common folk preparations do not allow for any good activity in these extracts.

AB  == grape skin extracts of riesling vitis vinifera l. grapes from conventionally or organically managed cultivars were compared on the basis of their phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, antimicrobial and antimutagenic properties and pesticide loads. promising results on their biological properties suggest that those extracts would be valuable as food preservatives. the antioxidant capacity  of conventional extracts was significantly higher, according to the higher content in catechin, epicatechin and procyanidin b. pesticide loads did not affect the antimutagenic or antimicrobial properties of the extracts. both extracts inhibited the growth of gram-positive foodborne pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium to similar  extents. possibly as a result of higher amounts of quercetin and its derivatives, higher antimicrobial effects against listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium were observed for the organic white grape skin extracts. conventional or organic extracts did not show remarkable antimutagenic effects when tested against the mutagen iq by means of the ames test. due to the presence of fungicides, the conidial germination of penicillium expansum, penicillium chrysogenum and aspergillus niger, were inhibited by 95% by conventional gse, while negligible effects were observed with organic grape extracts. the latter, however, showed inhibitory effects against trichoderma viridie and aspergillus versicolor.

AB  == objectives: to evaluate the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of nemonoxacin, a novel c8-methoxy non-fluorinated quinolone in murine systemic and local infection models. methods: the efficacy of nemonoxacin in systemic infections was evaluated in mouse peritonitis models using isolates of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, n=1), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa, n=1), methicillin- and levofloxacin-resistant staphylococcus capitis (levofloxacin-resistant mrsc, n=1), penicillin-intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp, n=1), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp, n=2), enterococcus faecalis (n=2, including 1 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, vre) and escherichia coli (n=3). the local infections included mouse pulmonary infections caused by prsp (n=1), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1) and mouse ascending  urinary tract infection caused by e. coli (n=1). results: in the mouse systemic infection model, nemonoxacin demonstrated potent activity against mssa (ed(50) =2.08 mg/kg), mrsa (ed(50) =2.59 mg/kg), levofloxacin-resistant mrsc (ed(50) =2.52 mg/kg), pisp (ed(50) =5.47 mg/kg), prsp (ed(50) =3.68-5.28 mg/kg) and e. coli (ed(50) =3.13-5.28 mg/kg), and moderate activity towards e. faecalis infection (ed(50) =8.48-15.16 mg/kg). the therapeutic efficacy of nemonoxacin was significantly higher (p<0.01) than that of levofloxacin in infections caused by gram-positive isolates (mssa, mrsa, levofloxacin-resistant mrsc, pisp, prsp and e. faecalis), but less potent than that of levofloxacin against e. coli infection (p<0.01). nemonoxacin in vivo efficacy results with gram-positive isolates (2- to 5-fold ed(50) advantage over levofloxacin) are consistent with the mic data (4- to 16-fold mic advantage of nemonoxacin over levofloxacin). in the mouse pulmonary infection model, nemonoxacin showed potent activity towards prsp (higher than levofloxacin) and k. pneumoniae (lower than levofloxacin) infections. in the mouse ascending urinary tract infection model, nemonoxacin exhibited potent activity against e. coli infection (lower than levofloxacin). conclusions: the results validated the potent efficacy of nemonoxacin in vivo. the higher efficacy of nemonoxacin than of levofloxacin towards infections caused by gram-positive cocci (especially mrsa, levofloxacin-resistant mrsc, prsp and vre) warrants investigation of its clinical use.

TI  == the photodynamic effect: the comparison of chemiexcitation by luminol and phthalhydrazide.
AB  == the presence of light, oxygen and photosensitizer (organic dye) is required for the photodynamic effect. light and photosensitizer are harmless by themselves, but when combined with oxygen, reactive oxygen species (ros) can be produced. this photodynamic effect is used in photodynamic therapy (pdt); the production of ros as lethal cytotoxic agents can inactivate tumor cells. however, during pdt, there are many difficulties, so it is not possible to excite the photosensitizer  using a laser, a source of light at the wavelengths specific to the photosensitizer (in visible region of the spectrum). chemiluminescence is the light emission as a result of a chemical reaction. it is possible to use a chemiluminescent mixture to excite the photosensitizer even if the light emission does not conform to the absorption maximum of the photosensitizer. luciferin and  luminol have been used as chemiluminescent compounds (energizers) for the excitation of the photosensitizers. the aim of this work was to compare the chemiexcitation of some selected photosensitizers (e.g. fluorescein, eosin, methylene blue, hypericin and phthalocyanines) by chemiluminescent mixtures containing luminol (high chemiluminescent quantum yield) or phthalhydrazide (low  chemiluminescent quantum yield) on some gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, e. coli) bacteria and some cell lines (nih3t3 and mcf7). the efficiency of the chemiexcitation was dependent on the kind of the photosensitizer and on the type  of the bacterial strain or cell line and was independent of the energizers.

TI  == characterisation of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis mutants with  reduced susceptibility to the investigational oxazolidinone rwj-416457.
AB  == rwj-416457 is a novel investigational oxazolidinone with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) to staphylococci and enterococci that are two- to four-fold lower than those of linezolid. single-step and serial passage in vitro resistance selection experiments were performed for rwj-416457 and linezolid with staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis laboratory and clinical isolates. rwj-416457 selected for resistant mutants in single-step selections at a frequency of </=1x10(-10), similar to that of linezolid. in serial passage selection experiments, a g2576t transversion in the domain v region of the 23s rrna gene was the predominant mutation observed for both oxazolidinones, suggesting similar 23s rrna binding sites. the associated development of increasing oxazolidinone resistance in e. faecalis (four 23s rrna alleles) required fewer passages than with s. aureus isolates (six 23s rrna alleles), and  resistance was generally proportionate to the number of mutated (g2576t) 23s rrna alleles. fold changes in mics were similar for both compounds, and mics for rwj-416457 remained two- to four-fold lower than those of linezolid for mutants selected by either compound. serial passage of linezolid with s. aureus oc 2878 yielded a novel a2572t 23s rrna mutation, whilst the final passages of s. aureus  oc 10517 with rwj-416457 resulted in the apparent loss of a mutated (g2576t) allele 6.

AB  == a class of cyclic acyldepsipeptide antibiotics collectively known as the enopeptins has recently attracted much attention because of their activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. these antibiotics are further distinguished by their novel mechanism of action in which they bind and deregulate the tightly controlled activity of the cytoplasmic protease clpp. although the natural products have poor pharmacological properties, a synthetic derivative called acyldepsipeptide 4 (adep 4) showed remarkable antibacterial activity both in vitro and in mouse models of bacterial  infections. a novel route to the adep 4 peptidolactone core structure, featuring  the joullie-ugi three-component reaction, was developed. this multicomponent reaction and a related multicomponent reaction, the ugi four-component reaction,  were used to prepare analogs that were designed using the principles of conformational analysis. these cyclic acyldepsipeptides were tested for their activity against drug-resistant, clinical isolates of staphylococci and enterococci. one adep 4 analog in which the pipecolate was replaced by 4-methyl pipecolate exhibited in vitro antibacterial activity against enterococci that was fourfold higher than the parent compound.

TI  == bacterial contamination of stethoscopes used by health workers: public health implications.
AB  == background: this study was designed to assess both the potential for bacterial transmission by stethoscopes used by health-care workers in nigeria and the implications for patient safety and control of hospital-acquired infections. methodology: a structured questionnaire was administered to health workers and the surface of the diaphragm of their stethoscopes swabbed for bacteriological analysis using standard techniques. results and conclusions: of the 107 stethoscopes surveyed, 84 (79%) were contaminated with bacteria; 59 (81%) of the  contaminated stethoscopes belonged to physicians and 25 (74%) were from other health workers. isolates included staphylococcus aureus (54%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (19%), enterococcus faecalis (14%), and escherichia coli (13%). all stethoscopes that had never been cleaned were contaminated while lower levels of  contamination were found on those cleaned one week or less before the survey (chi(2) = 22.4, p < .05). contamination was significantly higher on stethoscopes  cleaned with only water (100%) compared to those cleaned with alcohol (49%) (chi(2) = 30.17, p < .05). significantly fewer (9%) stethoscopes from health workers who washed their hands after seeing each patient were contaminated when compared with the instruments (86%) of those who did not practice hand washing (chi(2) = 23.79, p < .05). e. coli showed the highest antibiotic resistance, while s. aureus showed the highest antibiotic susceptibility. strict adherence to stethoscope disinfection practices by health workers can minimize cross-contamination and ensure improved patient safety in hospital environments.

TI  == preservation of viability and antibacterial activity of lactobacillus spp. in calcium alginate beads.
AB  == the objective of the study was to produce calcium alginate beads able to deliver  lactobacillus spp. (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus bulgaricus and lactobacillus lactis) with preserved viability and antibacterial activity. four types of beads, containing entrapped (e), surface and entrapped (es), surface (s) and concentrated surface and entrapped lactobacilli (c(es)) were prepared and physically characterized. the antibacterial activity of lactobacilli cultures before and after immobilization,  freeze-drying and throughout storage was studied in relationship to the viable number of lactobacilli. multi-resistant clinical isolates (methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus, vancomycine-resistant enterococcus faecalis, vim-2-metalo-beta-lactamase producing pseudomonas aeruginosa and ctx-m-15-beta-lactamase producing strains: escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae) were used as indicator strains. alginate beads in which lactobacilli  proliferated to the beads surface (es and c(es)) differed significantly from the  other types of beads in their physicochemical properties, showing smoother surface morphology, more spherical shape, bigger weight, lower calcium content, density and crushing force. lactobacilli cultures, at high cell concentrations (10(8)cfu/ml) were active against both gram-positive and negative multi-resistant bacteria. beads containing both entrapped and surface lactobacilli (es) resulted  in viability and antibacterial activity most similar to non-processed lactobacilli cultures. the viability and antibacterial activity of the immobilized lactobacilli remained stable after 6 months storage.

TI  == suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus acticoat and aquacel as an antiseptic dressing: an in vitro study.
AB  == background: the treatment of burn wounds is still a challenge regarding the management of antiseptic wound conditioning. especially, in the united states, silver-containing dressings, such as acticoat and aquacel are frequently used. because silver-containing dressings have well-known drawbacks such as an antimicrobial lack against pseudomonas aeruginosa, we sought to develop an alternative dressing method. in previous studies, we could demonstrate the excellent antiseptic properties of acetic acid against common burn unit germs, and in another study, the feasibility and suitability of a suprathel-acetic acid  matrix as an antiseptic dressing. materials and methods: this study was designed  to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus acticoat and aquacel. to cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: escherichia coli, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive klebsiella pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. results: the tests showed an excellent bactericidal effect of the suprathel-acetic acid matrix particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as proteus vulgaris, p. aeruginosa,  and acinetobacter baumannii. the efficiency was superior to that of acicoat and aquacel. conclusions: our results support the notion, that the suprathel-acetic acid matrix has an excellent bactericidal effect and therefore seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent in the treatment of burn wounds.

TI  == synergistic properties of the terpenoids aromadendrene and 1,8-cineole from the essential oil of eucalyptus globulus against antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the chemical composition of the essential oil of the fruits of eucalyptus globulus and to examine the potential application of the fruit oil against multidrug-resistant bacteria. glc/ms analysis in the fruit oil showed that aromadendrene was the main compound followed by 1,8-cineole and globulol. the three most abundant components of the fruit oil were also tested individually against microorganisms. in addition, the  synergistic effects of combinations of the major constituents (aromadendrene and  1,8-cineole) of the fruit oil were also investigated. all gram-positive bacteria  were susceptible to the fruit oil with different degrees of susceptibility as determined by microdilution method. the oil exerted a marked inhibition against multidrug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) enterococcus faecalis. the results indicated that aromadendrene might be responsible for the antimicrobial properties, whereas 1,8-cineole and globulol exhibited low activities. the checkerboard assay demonstrated that combinations of 1,8-cineole and aromadendrene reduce the mic in most cases in an additive way, whereas the time-kill assay indicates a synergistic effect.

TI  == seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd  in southern brazil.
AB  == the seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd grown in southern brazil was analyzed by gc-ms, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. the yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. the results obtained from principal components analysis (pca) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. the samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. samples collected during winter  contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). in autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. the observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. the essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus  mirabilis, morganella morganii, and enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), indicated  that s. aureus, b. subtilis, and candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest mic values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/ml, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/ml, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/ml, respectively.

TI  == bacterial contamination of surgical suture resembles a biofilm.
AB  == background: although much attention is currently directed to studying microbial biofilms on a variety of surfaces, few studies are designed to study bacterial growth on surgical suture. the purpose of this study was to compare the kinetic development of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis on five surgical suture materials and to clarify factors that might influence this growth. methods: pure cultures of s. aureus and e. faecalis were incubated with five types of suture for four days using either tissue culture medium or a bacterial growth medium. suture-associated bacteria were quantified daily. in selected experiments, the bacterial growth medium was supplemented with heparin, a substance known to promote s. aureus biofilm formation. the ultrastructure of s.  aureus biofilm developing on braided suture was studied with scanning electron microscopy. results: staphylococcus aureus and e. faecalis were recovered in greater numbers (typically p < 0.01) from braided than from monofilament suture,  and the numbers of bacteria were greater (often p < 0.01) on sutures incubated in bacterial growth medium rather than tissue culture medium. addition of heparin 1,000 u/ml to silk or braided polyglactin 910 suture incubated three days with s. aureus resulted in greater numbers of bacteria on day one but not on subsequent days. scanning electron microscopy showed a maturing s. aureus biofilm that developed from small clusters of cells among amorphous material and fibrillar elements to larger clusters of cells that appeared covered by more consolidated extracellular material. conclusions: bacterial growth was favored on braided vs.  monofilament suture, and heparin enhanced bacterial adherence after day one, but  not at subsequent times. staphylococcus aureus adhered to suture material and formed a structure consistent with a bacterial biofilm.

TI  == dissemination of an enterococcus inc18-like vana plasmid associated with vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == of the 9 vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (vrsa) cases reported to date in the literature, 7 occurred in michigan. in 5 of the 7 michigan vrsa cases, an  inc18-like vana plasmid was identified in the vrsa isolate and/or an associated vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) isolate from the same patient. this plasmid may play a critical role in the emergence of vrsa. we studied the geographical distribution of the plasmid by testing 1,641 vre isolates from three separate collections by pcr for plasmid-specific genes traa, repr, and vana. isolates from one collection (phase 2) were recovered from surveillance cultures  collected in 17 hospitals in 13 states. all vre isolates from 2 michigan institutions (n = 386) and between 60 and 70 vre isolates (n = 883) from the other hospitals were tested. fifteen vre isolates (3.9%) from michigan were positive for an inc18-like vana plasmid (9 e. faecalis [12.5%], 3 e. faecium [1.0%], 2 e. avium, and 1 e. raffinosus). six vre isolates (0.6%) from outside michigan were positive (3 e. faecalis [2.7%] and 3 e. faecium [0.4%]). of all e.  faecalis isolates tested, 6.0% were positive for the plasmid, compared to 0.6% for e. faecium and 3.0% for other spp. fourteen of the 15 plasmid-positive isolates from michigan had the same tn1546 insertion site location as the vrsa-associated inc18-like plasmid, whereas 5 of 6 plasmid-positive isolates from outside michigan differed in this characteristic. most plasmid-positive e. faecalis isolates demonstrated diverse patterns by pfge, with the exception of three pairs with indistinguishable patterns, suggesting that the plasmid is mobile in nature. although vre isolates with the vrsa-associated inc18-like vana  plasmid were more common in michigan, they remain rare. periodic surveillance of  vre isolates for the plasmid may be useful in predicting the occurrence of vrsa.

TI  == prevalence and clinical outcome of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis: a prospective observational study in  central part of croatia.
AB  == spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp) is a serious complication of liver cirrhosis and is defined as infected ascites in the absence of any recognizable secondary cause of infection. the aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence, incidence, pathogens and clinical outcome of sbp. this prospective observational study included 108 cirrhotic patients with ascites treated during 18 months. patients were divided into two groups according to diagnostic criteria of sbp: sbp group (n=23) and non-sbp group (n=85). differences in clinical outcomes between the two groups were analyzed, including mortality rate, incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, bacteremia/sepsis and frequency of rehospitalization. the pathogens responsible for sbp were analyzed in sbp group.  the prevalence of sbp was 21% and incidence 14.1% per year. statistically significant between-group differences were recorded in mortality (26% vs. 4.7%; p=0.017), incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (39% vs. 11.7%; p=0.015) and rehospitalization frequency (47.8% vs. 20%; p=0.05). the incidence of sepsis following episode of gastrointestinal bleeding was similar in both groups (55.5%  vs. 50%; p=0.892). the following pathogens were responsible for sbp: escherichia  coli (n=7), mrsa (n=2), acinetobacter spp. (n=2), staphylococcus aureus (n=1), streptococcus spp. (n=1), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=1) and enterococcus faecalis (n=1). as indicated by study results, the incidence and mortality of sbp were high. patients with liver cirrhosis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage were found to be at a high risk of developing sepsis with or without clinically proven sbp. the pathogens responsible for sbp were mostly gram-negative microorganisms;  however, there were also a significant proportion of gram-positive microorganisms and hospital infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. study results suggested the spectrum of pathogens to change due to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria within the hospital setting.

TI  == high level expression and purification of antimicrobial human cathelicidin ll-37  in escherichia coli.
AB  == the human antimicrobial peptide ll-37 is a cationic peptide with antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. this work describes the development of an expression system based on escherichia coli capable of high production of the recombinant ll-37. the fusion protein trx-ll-37 was expressed under control of t7 promoter. the expression of t7 polymerase in the e. coli strain constructed in this work was controlled by regulation mechanisms of the arabinose promoter. the expression plasmid was stabilized by the presence of parb locus which ensured higher homology of the culture during cultivation without antibiotic selection pressure. this system was capable of producing up to 1 g of fusion protein per 1 l of culture. the subsequent semipreparative hplc allowed us to isolate 40 mg of pure ll-37. ll-37 showed high antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms. its activity against candida albicans was practically nonexistent. minimal inhibition concentration (mic) determined for e. coli was 1.65 microm; for staphylococcus aureus 2.31 microm, and for enterococcus faecalis 5.54 microm. the effects of cathelicidin on e. coli included the ability to permeabilize both cell membranes, as could be observed by the increase of beta-galactosidase activity in extracellular space in time. physiological changes were studied by scanning electron microscopy; gram-positive microorganisms did not show any visible changes in cell shapes while the changes observed on e. coli cells were evident. the results of this work show that the herein designed expression system is capable of producing adequate quantities of active human antimicrobial peptide ll-37.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

AB  == treatment of infectious spondylitis in hemodialysis patients remains a challenge  because of comorbidities. this study aimed to evaluate the impact of end-stage renal disease (esrd) on the clinical manifestations and surgical outcomes of patients with spinal infection. sixteen patients who underwent surgical intervention were included. there were 3 thoracic and 13 lumbar lesions. all patients presented with intractable back pain at the start of treatment. six patients had a fever, nine had inflammation at the hemodialysis access site, and  six of them had concomitant bacteremia. ten patients had an elevated leukocyte count. serological tests indicated an elevation of the c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate level in all patients. five patients had a neurological compromise. postoperative complications included two mortalities, two iliac bone graft and implant dislodgement, and one retroperitoneal wound dehiscence. the preoperative mean visual analog scale score was 7.7 (range, 6-9), which improved to 3.4 (range, 2-5) at the final follow-up for 14 surviving patients. neurological improvement was obtained by at least one grade in four frankel c category patients. the radiographs revealed a good bony fusion in 12 cases although with a variable bone graft subsidence. in conclusion, early diagnosis of infectious spondylitis is difficult due to latent symptoms. a spine  infection should be suspected in hemodialysis patients with severe back pain, even when they are afebrile. surgical intervention for infectious spondylitis in  esrd patients undergoing hemodialysis can be performed with acceptable outcomes;  however, the complication and mortality rates are relative high.

AB  == the continuously increasing problem of multidrug-resistant (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and/or metallo-beta-lactamase producing) bacteria in recent years  has created the need to re-evaluate antibiotic therapy for these infections. fosfomycin is reconsidered to be an alternative treatment agent for such infections. fosfomycin was first discovered in spain in 1969 from cultures of streptomyces species and originally called phosphonomycin. in the early years, fosfomycin was administered parenterally to the patients with many serious infections including meningitis. in some european countries, fosfomycin is occasionally administered for the initial empirical therapy of sepsis or soft-tissue infections. although in most european countries fosfomycin has been used for many years, it has become available in clinical use only recently in turkey. in usa, the food and drug administration (fda) has approved fosfomycin only for the treatment of patients with uncomplicated cystitis. the use of fosfomycin in the treatment of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections and in the treatment of pediatric cancer patients with fever and neutropenia in combination with other antibiotics, has withdrawn attention to this agent. fosfomycin has a rapid bactericidal effect and a wide antibacterial spectrum, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, glycopeptide-susceptible or resistant enterococci and a large number of gram-negative pathogens. since it  has a long serum half-life and high concentrations are achieved in urine after oral administration; fosfomycin deserved further consideration for single-dose treatment of urinary tract infections caused by escherichia coil and enterococcus faecalis. in this review article the properties, mechanisms of action and resistance, antibacterial spectrum, clinical use, toxicity and adverse reactions  of fosfomycin have been summarized.

TI  == a type iii-like restriction endonuclease functions as a major barrier to horizontal gene transfer in clinical staphylococcus aureus strains.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is an versatile pathogen that can cause life-threatening infections. depending on the clinical setting, up to 50% of s. aureus infections  are caused by methicillin-resistant strains (mrsa) that in most cases are resistant to many other antibiotics, making treatment difficult. the emergence of community-acquired mrsa drastically changed the picture by increasing the risk of mrsa infections. horizontal transfer of genes encoding for antibiotic resistance  or virulence factors is a major concern of multidrug-resistant s. aureus infections and epidemiology. we identified and characterized a type iii-like restriction system present in clinical s. aureus strains that prevents transformation with dna from other bacterial species. interestingly, our analysis revealed that some clinical mrsa strains are deficient in this restriction system, and thus are hypersusceptible to the horizontal transfer of dna from other species, such as escherichia coli, and could easily acquire a vancomycin-resistance gene from enterococci. inactivation of this restriction system dramatically increases the transformation efficiency of clinical s. aureus strains, opening the field of molecular genetic manipulation of these strains using dna of exogenous origin.

AB  == a 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (est) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha) foot cdna library developed in our laboratory. the d. polymorpha defensin (dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. the mature dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin a domain. homologue searching against genbank database suggested that this dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin a. the recombinant dpd was in vitro expressed through an escherichia coli expression system. the antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant dpd were found against the growth of morganella sp., plesiomonas shigelloides, edwardsiella tarda, e. coli and staphylococcus aureus aureus (atcc12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (mic) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microm, respectively. however, with less than 50 microm no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four gram-negative bacteria (aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, motile aeromonas, flavobacterium sp., pseudomonas fluorescens, shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other gram-positive bacteria (bacillus megaterium atcc14581, carnobacterium maltaromaticum atcc27865, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and micrococcus leteus atcc4698), and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the rna fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) of dpd in the zebra  mussel suggested that the dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. by using the quantitative pcr, the expression level of dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. by comparing the amount of dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qpcr, we found that the higher expression levels of dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. findings of this study suggest that the expression of the dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.

TI  == berberine-inf55 (5-nitro-2-phenylindole) hybrid antimicrobials: effects of varying the relative orientation of the berberine and inf55 components.
AB  == hybrid antimicrobials containing an antibacterial linked to a multidrug resistance (mdr) pump inhibitor make up a promising new class of agents for countering efflux-mediated bacterial drug resistance. this study explores the effects of varying the relative orientation of the antibacterial and efflux pump  inhibitor components in three isomeric hybrids (ss14, ss14-m, and ss14-p) which link the antibacterial alkaloid and known substrate for the nora mdr pump berberine to different positions on inf55 (5-nitro-2-phenylindole), an inhibitor  of nora. the mics for all three hybrids against wild-type, nora-knockout, and nora-overexpressing staphylococcus aureus cells were found to be similar (9.4 to  40.2 microm), indicating that these compounds are not effectively effluxed by nora. the three hybrids were also found to have similar curing effects in a caenorhabditis elegans live infection model. each hybrid was shown to accumulate  in s. aureus cells to a greater extent than either berberine or berberine in the  presence of inf55, and the uptake kinetics of ss14 were found to differ from those of ss14-m and ss14-p. the effects on the uptake and efflux of the nora substrate ethidium bromide into s. aureus cells in the presence or absence of the hybrids were used to confirm mdr inhibition by the hybrids. mdr-inhibitory activity was confirmed for ss14-m and ss14-p but not for ss14. molecular dynamics simulations revealed that ss14 prefers to adopt a conformation that is not prevalent in either ss14-m or ss14-p, which may explain why some properties of ss14 diverge from those of its two isomers. in summary, subtle repositioning of the pump-blocking inf55 moiety in berberine-inf55 hybrids was found to have a minimal effect on their antibacterial activities but to significantly alter their effects on mdr pumps.

TI  == functional and structural analysis of a key region of the cell wall inhibitor moenomycin.
AB  == moenomycin a (mma) belongs to a family of natural products that inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis by binding to the peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases,  the enzymes that make the glycan chains of peptidoglycan. mma is remarkably potent, but its clinical utility has been hampered by poor physicochemical properties. moenomycin contains three structurally distinct regions: a pentasaccharide, a phosphoglycerate, and a c25 isoprenyl (moenocinyl) lipid tail  that gives the molecule its name. the phosphoglycerate moiety links the pentasaccharide to the moenocinyl chain. this moiety contains two negatively charged groups, a phosphoryl group and a carboxylate. both the phosphoryl group and the carboxylate have previously been implicated in target binding but the role of the carboxylate has not been explored in detail. here we report the synthesis of six mma analogues designed to probe the importance of the phosphoglycerate. these analogues were evaluated for antibacterial and enzyme inhibitory activity; the specific contacts between the phosphoglycerate and the protein target were assessed by x-ray crystallography in conjunction with molecular modeling. both the phosphoryl group and the carboxylate of the phosphoglycerate chain play roles in target binding. the negative charge of the carboxylate, and not its specific structure, appears to be the critical feature in binding since replacing it with a negatively charged acylsulfonamide group produces a more active compound than replacing it with the isosteric amide. analysis of the ligand-protein contacts suggests that the carboxylate makes a critical contact with an invariant lysine in the active site. the reported work provides information and validated computational methods critical for the design  of analogues based on moenomycin scaffolds.

TI  == [investigation of the in vitro antibacterial effects of statins].
AB  == it was previously shown that statins have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti-oxidant effects. this study was aimed to investigate the in-vitro antibacterial effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin. in this study antibacterial activity of the statins were tested against 16 methicillin-susceptible stophylococcus aureus (mssa), 16 methicillin-resistant s.aureus (mrsa), 16 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus (mrcons), 9 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium, 7 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecolis, 13 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, 16 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) positive escherichia coli, 16 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 acinetobacter boumannii, 15 esbl positive klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 stenotrophomonas maltophilio by broth microdilution method according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) performance and interpretive guidelines. s. aureus atcc 29213, s. aureus atcc 25923, s. aureus atcc 43300, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, k.pneumoniae atcc 700603 and e. coli atcc 35218 were tested as control strains. the results showed that minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values for all isolates were > 128 microg/ml for the two statins tested. however, mic of simvastatin was 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 and was 64 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 25923 and e. faecalis atcc 29212 and was > 128 microg/ml for others, but mic of atorvastatin was > 128 microg/mi for all standard strains. according to these results, we observed that simvastatin and atorvastain had no significant antibacterial effect in vitro. in  this study, although no antibacterial effect of statins were determined in vitro, further studies are needed to investigate the combined effect of statins with antibacterial agents in the living organism.

TI  == nepetalactone content and antibacterial activity of the essential oils from different parts of nepeta persica.
AB  == the essential oils from the flower, leaf, stem and root of nepeta persica boiss., analyzed by gc and gc/ms, were shown to contain 4abeta,7alpha,7abeta-nepetalactone (58.5%, 62.3%, 66.2% and 27.1%, respectively), and 4aalpha,7alpha,7abeta-nepetalactone (33.0%, 28.3%, 24.9% and 7.6%, respectively). the other main component of the flower and stem oils was alpha-pinene (3.6% and 4.4%) and of the leaf oil beta-ocimene (3.6%). in the root oil, other main constituents were alpha-pinene (40.4%), alpha-amorphene (5.3%), gamma-cadinene (2.9%), and cis-calamenene (2.5%). nepetalactone was the major component of the flower, leaf and stem oils, which are thus important sources of  nepetalactone. antibacterial activities of the flower, leaf, stem and root oils were evaluated using the micro-dilution broth method. inhibitory effects on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi and enterococcus faecalis were recorded. the flower, leaf, stem, and root oils had difference activities against the test microorganisms. the antibacterial property of the essential oils might be ascribed to their high content of nepetalactone isomers.

TI  == isolation, phylogenetic analysis and anti-infective activity screening of marine  sponge-associated actinomycetes.
AB  == terrestrial actinomycetes are noteworthy producers of a multitude of antibiotics, however the marine representatives are much less studied in this regard. in this  study, 90 actinomycetes were isolated from 11 different species of marine sponges that had been collected from offshore ras mohamed (egypt) and from rovinj (croatia). phylogenetic characterization of the isolates based on 16s rrna gene sequencing supported their assignment to 18 different actinomycete genera representing seven different suborders. fourteen putatively novel species were identified based on sequence similarity values below 98.2% to other strains in the ncbi database. a putative new genus related to rubrobacter was isolated on m1 agar that had been amended with sponge extract, thus highlighting the need for innovative cultivation protocols. testing for anti-infective activities was performed against clinically relevant, gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria, fungi (candida albicans) and human parasites (leishmania major, trypanosoma brucei). bioactivities against these pathogens were documented for 10 actinomycete isolates. these results show a high diversity of actinomycetes associated with marine sponges as well as highlight their potential to produce anti-infective agents.

TI  == spectrum and prevalence of fungi infecting deep tissues of lower-limb wounds in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == the prevalence rate and spectrum of fungi infecting deep tissues of diabetic lower-limb wounds (dlws) have not been previously studied. five hundred eighteen  (382 male and 136 female) consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes hospitalized  due to infected lower-limb wounds were enlisted in this study. deep tissue (approximately 0.5- x 0.5-cm size) taken perioperatively from the wound bed was cultured for fungi. fungi was found in 27.2% (141/518) of the study population. candida parapsilosis (25.5%), candida tropicalis (22.7%), trichosporon asahii (12.8%), candida albicans (10.6%), and aspergillus species (5.0%) were the most predominant fungal isolates. of the fungal isolates, 17.7% were resistant to itraconazole, 6.9% were resistant to amphotericin b, 6.9% were resistant to voriconazole, 3.9% were resistant to fluconazole, and 1.5% were resistant to flucytosine. of the population, 79.7% (413/518) had bacterial infection in deep tissue. the predominant isolates were enterococcus faecalis (14.1%), staphylococcus aureus (12.2%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.8%). mixed fungal and bacterial infections were seen in 21.4% of patients, while 5.8% had only fungal infection and 58.3% had only bacterial infections. another 14.5% had neither bacteria nor fungi in the deep tissue. patients with higher glycosylated  hemoglobin levels had significantly more fungal infections. our study reveals that deep-seated fungal infections are high in dlws. in the context of delayed wound healing and amputation rates due to dlws, it is important to study the pathogenicity of fungi in deep tissues of dlws and their possible contribution to delayed wound healing. the role of antifungal agents in wound management needs to be evaluated further.

TI  == evaluation of efflux activity of bacteria by a semi-automated fluorometric system.
AB  == a semi-automated method that uses the common efflux pump (ep) substrate ethidium  bromide (eb) is described for the assessment of ep systems of bacteria. the method employs the rotor-gene(tm) 3000 thermocycler (corbett research) for the real-time assessment of accumulation and efflux of eb in phosphate-buffered solution (pbs) under varying physiological conditions, such as temperature, ph, presence and absence of the energy source, and presence of efflux pumps inhibitors (epis). the method is sufficiently sensitive to characterize intrinsic ep systems of reference strains, a prime necessity if there is a need for assessment of ep-mediated multi-drug resistance (mdr). the method has been successfully applied by us to characterize intrinsic and over-expressed ep systems of escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, and mycobacterium smegmatis and mycobacterium avium, suggesting that if the organism  can be maintained in pbs, the system described may suffice for the evaluation and assessment of its ep system.

TI  == [interpretive reading of the antibiogram in gram positive cocci].
AB  == resistance to methicillin in staphylococcus is related to the expression of the meca gene, and involves resistance to all beta-lactams, with the exception of the new cephalosporins, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. breakpoints for interpretation  of this mechanism differ in s. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. for macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins b, (mls(b)) the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump nora determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences in the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. strains of s. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (gisa strains) have been described, as well as highly-vancomycin-resistant isolates (vana isolates). in spain, there is a high percentage of s. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, due to mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. the most frequent phenotype of resistance to mls(b) in this species is caused by methylase production. resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is mainly related to mutations in parc/pare (low level) and in gyra. it is important to detect low level resistance due to its clinical implications. no strains of s. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. in spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in s. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. e. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to e. faecium. enterococci show intrinsic  low-level resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (high-level resistance) became resistant to the combination. glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in spain, but nosocomial outbreaks due to vana enterococci and case reports due to vanb2 enterococci have been recently reported.

AB  == background: biofilm-associated infections in trauma surgery are difficult to treat with conventional therapies. therefore, it is important to develop new treatment modalities. maggots in captured bags, which are permeable for larval excretions/secretions, aid in healing severe, infected wounds, suspect for biofilm formation. therefore we presumed maggot excretions/secretions would reduce biofilm formation. questions/purposes: we studied biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella oxytoca, enterococcus faecalis, and enterobacter cloacae on polyethylene, titanium, and stainless steel. we compared the quantities of biofilm formation between the bacterial species on the various biomaterials and the quantity of biofilm formation after various incubation times. maggot excretions/secretions were added to existing biofilms to examine their effect. methods: comb-like models of the biomaterials, made to fit in a 96-well microtiter plate, were incubated with bacterial suspension. the formed biofilms were stained in crystal violet, which was eluted in ethanol. the optical density (at 595 nm) of the eluate was determined to quantify biofilm formation. maggot excretions/secretions were pipetted in different concentrations to (nonstained) 7-day-old biofilms, incubated 24 hours, and finally measured. results: the strongest biofilms were formed by s. aureus and s. epidermidis on polyethylene and the weakest on titanium. the highest quantity of biofilm formation was reached within 7 days for both bacteria. the presence of excretions/secretions reduced biofilm formation on all biomaterials. a maximum of 92% of biofilm reduction was measured. conclusions: our observations suggest maggot excretions/secretions decrease biofilm formation and could provide a new treatment for biofilm formation on infected biomaterials.

TI  == the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor sigv plays a key role in the original  model of lysozyme resistance and virulence of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == background: enterococcus faecalis is one of the leading agents of nosocomial infections. to cause diseases, pathogens or opportunistic bacteria have to adapt  and survive to the defense systems encountered in the host. one of the most important compounds of the host innate defense response against invading microorganisms is lysozyme. it is found in a wide variety of body fluids, as well as in cells of the innate immune system. lysozyme could act either as a muramidase and/or as a cationic antimicrobial peptide. like staphylococcus aureus, e. faecalis is one of the few bacteria that are completely lysozyme resistant. results: this study revealed that oata (o-acetyl transferase) and dlt  (d-alanylation of lipoteicoic acids) genes contribute only partly to the lysozyme resistance of e. faecalis and that a specific transcriptional regulator, the extracytoplasmic function sigv sigma factor plays a key role in this event. indeed, the sigv single mutant is as sensitive as the oata/dlta double mutant, and the sigv/oata/dlta triple mutant displays the highest level of lysozyme sensitivity suggesting synergistic effects of these genes. in s. aureus, mutation of both oata and dlt genes abolishes completely the lysozyme resistance, whereas  this is not the case in e. faecalis. interestingly sigv does not control neither  oata nor dlt genes. moreover, the sigv mutants clearly showed a reduced capacity  to colonize host tissues, as they are significantly less recovered than the parental jh2-2 strain from organs of mice subjected to intravenous or urinary tract infections. conclusions: this work led to the discovery of an original model of lysozyme resistance mechanism which is obviously more complex than those described for other gram positive pathogens. moreover, our data provide evidences for a direct link between lysozyme resistance and virulence of e. faecalis.

TI  == a genetic determinant in streptococcus gordonii challis encodes a peptide with activity similar to that of enterococcal sex pheromone cam373, which facilitates  intergeneric dna transfer.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis strains secrete multiple peptides representing different sex pheromones that induce mating responses by bacteria carrying specific conjugative plasmids. the pheromone cam373, which induces a response by the enterococcal plasmid pam373, has been of interest because a similar activity is also secreted by streptococcus gordonii and staphylococcus aureus. the potential  to facilitate intergeneric dna transfer from e. faecalis is of concern because of extensive multiple antibiotic resistance, including vancomycin resistance, that has emerged among enterococci in recent years. here, we characterize the related  pheromone determinant in s. gordonii and show that the peptide it encodes, gordonii-cam373, does indeed induce transfer of plasmid dna from e. faecalis into s. gordonii. the streptococcal determinant camg encodes a lipoprotein with a leader sequence, the last 7 residues of which represent the gordonii-cam373 heptapeptide svfilaa. synthetic forms of the peptide had activity similar to that of the enterococcal cam373 aifilas. the lipoprotein moiety bore no resemblance to the lipoprotein encoded by e. faecalis. we also identified determinants in s. gordonii encoding a signal peptidase and an eep-like zinc metalloprotease (lspa and eep, respectively) similar to those involved in processing certain pheromone  precursors in e. faecalis. mutations generated in camg, lspa, and eep each resulted in the ablation of gordonii-cam373 activity in culture supernatants. this is the first genetic analysis of a potential sex pheromone system in a commensal oral streptococcal species, which may have implications for intergeneric gene acquisition in oral biofilms.

AB  == the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (dfi). the trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in dfi, including gram-positive and gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic  bacteria with 95% of mics < or =2 microg/ml for the entire collection. the spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for dfi, such as staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacteroides fragilis. as reported previously, pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. the excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum  activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility  of tigecycline for pathogens associated with dfis.

TI  == photoantimicrobials as a potential local approach to geriatric utis.
AB  == aims: to test the efficacy of acceptable photoantimicrobial agents against bacterial pathogens implicated in complicated urinary tract infection (uti) in comparison with conventionally employed antibacterials. methods and results: toluidine blue (tb), methylene blue (mb), 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ala), trimethoprim and levofloxacin were employed in the study against the typical uti-implicated pathogens staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and proteus mirabilis. standard bacterial cell culture was used to assay the activity both in the dark and under 660-nm led-illuminated conditions. tb and mb were highly photoactive across the range and exhibited rapid kill rates, their effects being  assayed after 20-min illumination, rather than the 18-h incubation employed with  the other compounds. trimethoprim was inactive against all bacteria except pr. mirabilis, while levofloxacin maintained highly bactericidal activity throughout. ala required high concentrations for effective action but, for porphyrin production in situ, also required an 18-h incubation. conclusions: tb and mb were highly and rapidly photobactericidal in comparison with the remaining agents tested. significance and impact of the study: ubiquitous catheterization of geriatric patients offers a portal for light delivery to the urinary tract. the photoantimicrobial approach thus offers considerable potential.

TI  == in vitro prevention of the emergence of daptomycin resistance in staphylococcus aureus and enterococci following combination with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or  ampicillin.
AB  == daptomycin is bactericidal against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate-resistant s. aureus (gisa) and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococci. however, selection for daptomycin-resistant derivatives has occasionally been reported during therapy in humans. here we evaluate whether selection for daptomycin-resistant s. aureus or  enterococci could be prevented in vitro by combining daptomycin with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, gentamicin or rifampicin. six strains of s. aureus (four mrsa and two gisa) and four strains of enterococci (two enterococcus faecalis and two enterococcus faecium) were serially exposed in broth to two-fold stepwise increasing concentrations of daptomycin alone or in combination with a fixed concentration [0.25x minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)] of either of the second agents. the daptomycin mic was examined after each cycle. exposure to daptomycin alone gradually selected for s. aureus and enterococci with an increased mic. gentamicin did not prevent the emergence of daptomycin-resistant bacteria. rifampicin was also unable to prevent daptomycin resistance, although resistance was slightly delayed. in contrast, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ampicillin prevented or greatly delayed the selection of daptomycin-resistant mutants in s. aureus and enterococci, respectively. addition of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or ampicillin to daptomycin prevents, or greatly delays, daptomycin resistance in vitro. future studies in animal models are needed to predict the utility of these combinations in humans.

TI  == conservative management of mesh-site infection in hernia repair.
AB  == background: mesh hernioplasty is the preferred surgical procedure for large abdominal wall hernias. infection remains one of the most challenging complications of this operation. salvaging infected prosthetic material after ventral hernia repair is rarely successful. most cases require mesh excision and  complex abdominal wall reconstruction, with variable success rates. in this article, we report 3 cases of mesh salvage after laparoscopic ventral herniorrhapy with a novel use of percutaneous drainage and antibiotic irrigation. results: three patients developed infected seromas after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. the fascial defect of the first patient was repaired with a commercially available 20 x 18 cm polytetrafluoroethylene (ptfe) mesh. a complex  fluid collection developed the following month in the anterior abdominal wall overlying the patient's mesh. the cultures grew staphylococcus aureus. the second patient had a 30 x 20 cm ptfe mesh placed, which developed a fluid collection with enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli. the third case underwent repair, using a another commercially available 22 x 28 cm ptfe mesh. a fluid collection measuring 20 x 10 cm in the anterior abdominal wall developed, growing staphylococcus lugdunensis. in all 3 cases, a percutaneous drain was placed within the fluid collection and long-term intravenous (i.v.) access was obtained. i.v. antibiotics were initiated. in addition, gentamicin (80 mg) with 20 ml of saline was infused through the drain 3 times a day. all patients have remained free of clinical signs of infection following the completion of therapy. conclusions: infected mesh after laparoscopic ventral herniorrhapy without systemic sepsis may be amenable to nonoperative treatment. a conservative approach that includes percutaneous drainage followed by antibiotic irrigation is a potential alternative to prosthetic removal in carefully selected patients. further evaluation of this technique is warranted to define the most appropriate  management strategies for these patients.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria isolated in brazilian hospitals participating in the sentry program (2005-2008).
AB  == we report the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequently isolated gram-positive bacteria in the brazilian hospitals participating in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program. the strains were consecutively collected (one per patient) between january 2005 and september 2008 and susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods at the jmi laboratories (north liberty, iowa, usa). a total of 3,907 gram-positive cocci were analyzed. the gram-positive organisms most frequently isolated from bloodstream infections were staphylococcus aureus (2,218 strains; 20.2% of total), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 812 strains [14.7%]), and enterococcus spp. (754 strains; 5.0%). s. aureus ranked first (28.1%) and enterococcus faecalis ranked 7th (4.5%) among cases of skin and soft tissue infections. s. aureus was also the second most frequently isolated pathogen from  patients with lower respiratory tract infections (24.9% of cases) after pseudomonas aeruginosa (30.5%). resistance to oxacillin was observed in 31.0% of  s. aureus and the vast majority of oxacillin-resistant (mrsa) strains were also resistant to clindamycin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. vancomycin, linezolid and daptomycin were all very active against s. aureus strains tested (>99.9-100.0% susceptible), but daptomycin (mic(50), 0.25 g/ml and mic(90), 0.5 g/ml) was four- to eight-fold more potent than vancomycin (mic(50) and mic(90) of 1 g/ml) and linezolid (mic(50), 1 g/ml and mic(90), 2 g/ml). vancomycin resistance increased significantly among enterococci during the study period, but it was restrict to only one medical center until 2007 and emerged in a second medical center in 2008. daptomycin was the most active antimicrobial tested against enterococci in general (100.0% susceptible), followed by linezolid (99.9% susceptible), ampicillin (87.4%) and vancomycin (84.6%). in conclusion, daptomycin and linezolid showed excellent in vitro activity against contemporary  gram-positive organisms (3,907) collected in brazilian hospitals monitored by the sentry program, including mrsa, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and other  multi-drug-resistant organisms. although vancomycin resistance rates in brazil appears to be relatively low compared to those reported in the usa, vre has emerged and rapidly disseminated in some brazilian medical centers.

AB  == the influence of antibiotic dosages and bacterial mutator phenotypes on the emergence of linezolid-resistant mutants was evaluated in an in vitro pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. a twice-daily 0.5-h infusion of a 200-, 600-, or 800-mg dose for 48 h was simulated against four strains (mic, 2 microg/ml): staphylococcus aureus rn4220 and its mutator derivative muts2, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, and a mutator clinical strain of e. faecalis, ef1497. the peak concentrations (4.38 to 4.79, 13.4 to 14.6, and 19.2 to 19.5 microg/ml) and half-lives at beta-phase (5.01 to 6.72 h) fit human plasma linezolid pharmacokinetics. due to its bacteriostatic property, the cumulative percentages of the dosing interval during which the drug concentration exceeded the mic (t > mic), 66.6 and 69.1% of the dosing interval, were not significant, except for ef1497, with an 800-mg dose and a t > mic of 80.9%. at the standard 600-mg dosage, resistant mutants (2- to 8-fold mic increases) were selected only  with ef1497. a lower, 200-mg dosage did not select resistant mutants of e. faecalis atcc 29212, but a higher, 800-mg dosage against ef1497 did not prevent their emergence. for the most resistant mutant (mic, 16 microg/ml), characterization of 23s rrna genes revealed the substitution a2453g in two of the four operons, which was previously described only in in vitro mutants of archaebacteria. nevertheless, this mutant did not yield further mutants under 600- or 200-mg treatment. in conclusion, linezolid was consistently efficient against s. aureus strains. the emergence of resistant e. faecalis mutants was probably favored by the rapid decline of linezolid concentrations against a strong mutator, a phenotype less exceptional in e. faecalis than in s. aureus.

TI  == [evolution in the antibiotic susceptibility and resistance].
AB  == over the last decade the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has been a growing problem, especially in some geographic areas, making useless most of the classical antibiotic therapies. the rapid emergence of resistant bacteria is  the result of different factors as the intrinsic microbial complexity, the growing attitude to travel of humans, animals and goods, the use of antibiotics outside hospitals, and the lack of precise therapeutic chooses for high risk group of patients. the antibiotic-resistance becomes certainly a serious problem  when a resistant pathogen, and often multi-resistant today, is present in an infective site. in fact in a recent estimate of the centre for disease control and prevention (cdc) about 90.000 deaths per year in the usa are attributable to  bacterial infections and in particular to resistant pathogens. it appears clear that the clinic relevance of this problem is the decimation of the sensible germs of the normal flora that leads to the upper hand of the only resistant bacteria.  the antibiotic therapy, in fact, select the resistance and each bacteria has developed a particular strategy to survive: mutations of the genetic content or acquisition of resistance genes from the external. among the gram positive bacteria, besides methicillin resistant staphyloccocus aureus, there are other pathogens such as coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, some species of streptococci and multiresistant corynebacterium. the cons, eg. s. epidermidis, s. hominis and s. haemolyticus, are recognized as new important nosocomial pathogens and are not only responsible of invasive infections but have become in few years resistant to oxacillin (more  than 60%) and multiresistant. the unsuspected fragility of glycopeptides, which for 40 years have been the most important treatment against infections due to gram-positive bacteria, has posed the need for new antimicrobial molecules. among the therapeutic possible options there are linezolid, tygecyline and daptomycin,  but new other molecules are appearing in the clinical use like ceftobiprole and dalbavancin.

TI  == effects of biofilm treatments on the multi-species lubbock chronic wound biofilm  model.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the efficacy of several biofilm effectors in inhibiting biofilm formation in an in vitro multi-species chronic wound biofilm model. method: the lubbock chronic wound biofilm (lcwb) model has been described in detail elsewhere. pathogens used in the model are pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. these are three of the most important species associated with biofilms. here, the model was exposed to the following biofilm effectors: xylitol, salicylic acid, farnesol, erythritol and two proprietary, semi-solid, wound-dressing formulations currently under development (sanguitec gels). results: biofilm formation was completely inhibited in the lcwb model following treatment with 20% xylitol, 10% erythritol, 1,000 microg/ml farnesol, 20mm salicylic acid or 0.1% of either of the two sanguitec gel formulations. salicylic acid specifically inhibited s. aureus (p<0.01) at 10mm and 20mm, consequently increasing the ratios of p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis within the biofilm. xylitol had an increasing inhibitory effect on p. aeruginosa (p<0.01) at all concentrations evaluated. erythritol had an inhibitory effect on p. aeruginosa and s. aureus growth (p<0.01) at over 5% concentrations.  the inhibitory effect of both sanguitec gel formulations was more broadly effective, with an increasingly inhibitory effect on all lcwb species (p<0.01). conclusion: the lcwb model provides a multi-species format with which to evaluate the effect of biofilm effectors on wound flora in a biofilm phenotype. these results suggest that different treatments can target specific populations within  a biofilm. salicylic acid preferentially targeted s. aureus, xylitol preferentially targeted p. aeruginosa, while erythritol preferentially targeted both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus. in contrast, the two sanguitec gel formulations provided a broad, less preferential, inhibition of biofilm development. declaration of interest: research and testing laboratory is a for-profit enterprise that develops molecular methods and performs service research work on  biofilms. sanguitec gel was developed by jpk and cej.

TI  == [antimicrobial treatment of nosocomial intra-abdominal infections--new treatment  options with tygecycline].
AB  == introduction: nosocomial, intra-abdominal infections are extremely serious conditions, considering possibilities for their early diagnosis, as well as for their effective therapy. multiresistant bacteria (enterobacteriacae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases - esbl escherichia coli, klebsiella species, vancomycin-resistant enterococci [vre], and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus [mrsa]) are frequently isolated as pathogens of these infections. tygecycline is among the novel wide- spectrum antibiotics affecting multiresistant bacteria, which are being introduced in clinical practice. aim: the aim of this study is to assess actual sensitivity of tygecycline to the commonest pathogens of intra-abdominal infections, generated in hospitalized surgical patients. based on the sensitivity tests, tygecycline was indicated for  targeted antibiotic therapy in intraabdominal infections. methods: sensitivity to tygecycline, aminopenicillins, fluorochinoloni and gentamycine was established for the following bacteria: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonie, enterobacter  cloacea, proteus mirabilis. sensitivity to oxacillin, clincamycine and tygecycline was tested in staphylococcus aureus, and to fluorochinolini, gentamycine and tygecycline in enterococcus faecalis, and to fluorochinoloni, gentamycine, ceftazidime and gentamycine in pseudomonas aeruginosa. based on the  sensitivity results, tygecycline was administered in two patients with postsurgical intra-abdominal infections caused by esbl escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumonie. the initital dose of tygecycline was 100 mg i.v., followed  by tygecycline 50 mg i.v. every 12 hours for 7 days. results: the isolated bacteria showed 98-100% sensitivity to tygecycline, except psudomonas aeruginosa, where 100% resistance was demonstrated. targeted antimicrobial medication with tygecycline proved effective in postoperative nosocomial intra-abdominal infections, the both concerned patients recovered. conclusion: the choice of antimicrobial medication in nosocomial intra-abdominal infections requires through evaluation considering various factors including prior antibiotic therapy, co-morbidities and the current status of sensitivity with respect to potential multiresistant pathogens. tygecycline shows significant in vitro efficacy against resistant gram-positive and key gram-negative facultative bacteria, which are a common cause of intra-abdominal infections in surgery patients. clinical experience has shown that tygecycline is safe and effective in the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == comparative genomics and transduction potential of enterococcus faecalis temperate bacteriophages.
AB  == to determine the relative importance of temperate bacteriophage in the horizontal gene transfer of fitness and virulence determinants of enterococcus faecalis, a panel of 47 bacteremia isolates were treated with the inducing agents mitomycin c, norfloxacin, and uv radiation. thirty-four phages were purified from culture supernatants and discriminated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and  restriction mapping. from these analyses the genomes of eight representative phages were pyrosequenced, revealing four distinct groups of phages. three groups of phages, phifl1 to 3, were found to be sequence related, with phifl1a to c and  phifl2a and b sharing the greatest identity (87 to 88%), while phifl3a and b share 37 to 41% identity with phifl1 and 2. phifl4a shares 3 to 12% identity with the phages phifl1 to 3. the phifl3a and b phages possess a high dna sequence identity with the morphogenesis and lysis modules of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris prophages. homologs of the streptococcus mitis platelet binding phage tail proteins, pbla and pblb, are encoded on each sequenced e. faecalis phage. few other phage genes encoding potential virulence functions were identified, and there was little evidence of carriage of lysogenic conversion genes distal to endolysin, as has been observed with genomes of many temperate phages from the opportunist pathogens staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. e. faecalis jh2-2 lysogens were generated using the eight phages, and these were examined for their relative fitness in galleria mellonella. several lysogens exhibited different effects upon survival of g. mellonella compared to their isogenic parent. the eight phages were tested for their ability to package host dna, and three were shown to be very effective for generalized transduction of naive host cells of the laboratory strains og1rf and jh2-2.

TI  == single-dose daptomycin pharmacokinetics in chronic haemodialysis patients.
AB  == background: daptomycin has concentration-dependent antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria. its use is increasing in haemodialysis units. the manufacturer recommends a 4-6-mg/kg dose administered every 48 hrs for patients receiving haemodialysis. however, there are no published data about daptomycin pharmacokinetics and clearance during haemodialysis. the recommended dosing regimen would conflict with asymmetric thrice-weekly haemodialysis, which yields  two ~44-hr and one ~68-hr interdialytic periods. this is the first study to evaluate daptomycin pharmacokinetics in haemodialysis patients, assess the extent of daptomycin dialytic removal and model serum concentrations at 44 and 68 hrs. methods: six otherwise healthy subjects on chronic haemodialysis (55.3 +/- 16.1 years old, three females, 66.2 +/- 14.2 kg) received a single 6-mg/kg dose of daptomycin post-haemodialysis infused over 30 minutes. serial blood samples were  collected for ~44 hrs (pre-next haemodialysis) and throughout the subsequent haemodialysis session with a high permeability haemodialyser. individual pharmacokinetic parameters determined by compartmental analysis were used to model trough serum concentrations at 44 and 68 hrs with 6-, 8- and 10-mg/kg post-haemodialysis doses. results: the haemodialysis session in this trial yielded mean urea and daptomycin reduction ratios of 79.6 +/- 5.8% and 57.6 +/- 9.2%, respectively. daptomycin half-life was 19.4 +/- 6.5 and 3.8 +/- 1.1 hrs 'off' and 'on haemodialysis', respectively, with minimal rebound 1 hr post-haemodialysis. all modelled trough concentrations at 44 and 68 hrs at all doses exceed typical minimum inhibitory concentration (mic(90)) values for staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. conclusions: daptomycin serum concentrations declined by ~50% after a 4-hr haemodialysis session with a high permeability haemodialyser. a 6-mg/kg i.v. post-haemodialysis thrice-weekly dose  should result in sufficient pre-haemodialysis daptomycin serum concentrations even after a 68-hr interdialytic period.

AB  == postoperative surgical site infection (ssi) in orthopaedic trauma surgery is uncommon, but can present serious complications. this study was designed to assess the prevalence of, and to identify the risk factors for, ssi following acetabular fracture open reduction and internal fixation. a total of 326 consecutive patients who underwent acetabular fracture surgery were retrospectively reviewed. there were 17 patients (5.2%) who developed a ssi, including 10 deep infections and 7 superficial infections. staphylococcus aureus  was the most common causative pathogens in 9 patients, and was methicillin-resistant in 3 patients. enterococcus faecalis was found in 6 patients, staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 patients, and pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterbacter cloacae in 2 patients each. fourteen of 17 patients developed their infection within 4 weeks after the fixation. univariate analysis demonstrated that the ssi group had statistically significant higher injury severity score, longer intensive care unit (icu) stays, larger amount of packed red blood cells transfused, longer operative time, larger estimated operative blood loss, higher body mass index (bmi), more frequent performance of combined approach, embolisation of internal iliac arteries, association of urinary tract injury, and morel-lavallee lesion compared to the no ssi group. multivariate analysis using these 10 parameters showed that bmi, icu stay, and morel-lavallee  lesion were independently significant risk factors for ssi. to reduce the incidence of ssi following acetabular fracture surgery, special attention should  be directed at the care of obese patients, patients requiring icu care, and patients with associated morel-lavallee lesions.

TI  == bactericidal activity of glutaraldehyde-like compounds from olive products.
AB  == the bactericidal effects of several olive compounds (nonenal, oleuropein, tyrosol, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid either free [eda]  or linked to tyrosol [tyeda] or to hydroxytyrosol [hyeda]), other food phenolic compounds (catechin, epicatechin, eugenol, thymol, carvacrol, and carnosic acid), and commercial disinfectants (glutaraldehyde [gta] and ortho-phthalaldehyde [opa]), were tested against strains of pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and escherichia coli. it was found that the bactericidal activities of olive gta-like compounds (eda, hyeda, and tyeda) were  greater than those exerted by several food phenolic substances. surprisingly, these olive antimicrobials were as active as the synthetic biocides gta and opa against the four bacteria studied. thus, it has been proposed that the bactericidal activity of the main olive antimicrobials is primarily due to their  dialdehydic structure, which is similar to that of the commercial biocides gta and opa. our results clearly reveal that olive gta-like compounds possess a strong bactericidal activity even greater than that of other food phenolic compounds or synthetic biocides.

TI  == risk factors and management of gram-positive bacteraemia.
AB  == the incidence of gram-positive bloodstream infections has been increasing steadily. the virulence of coagulase-negative staphylococci is based mainly on their ability to produce biofilms, and thus cause infections of intravascular devices and foreign bodies, which must be removed to resolve the infection. staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of endocarditis, and it is important to recognize patients at risk of the complications of s. aureus bloodstream infections. the rate of meticillin resistance is higher in healthcare-related infections, although clones of community-acquired meticillin-resistant s. aureus  carrying the panton-valentine leukocidin have recently emerged. vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) creep gives cause for concern, and mics >1 microg/ml are associated with higher failure rates and mortality in patients with s. aureus bacteraemia treated with vancomycin. daptomycin should be considered the optimal empirical treatment for s. aureus bloodstream infections in settings  with medium to high prevalence of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections. enterococci are the third leading cause of gram-positive bacteraemia  in our institution. management of this disease is difficult because of its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics, mainly in enterococcus faecium infections. the recently described synergism of ampicillin plus ceftriaxone is a good therapeutic option for enterococcus faecalis bacteraemia and endocarditis caused  by high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains.

TI  == global reemergence of tuberculosis: are host defense peptides an option to ameliorate disease burden?
AB  == tuberculosis is the most relevant infectious disease worldwide according to the estimates of the world health organization, and despite being a curable disease,  it requires a 6-9-month therapy with multiple antibiotics. intermittent drug therapy due to noncompliance or poor delivery of therapy promotes the emergence of bacterial strains showing resistance to multiple drugs and the rise of extremely drug-resistant strains. moreover, increased antibiotic resistance has been observed for several microorganisms, including extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. in vitro, cathelicidin induction results in enhanced mycobacterial clearance, and synthetic human neutrophil peptides had a rather modest bactericidal effect in mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected mice. in vivo therapeutic efficacy of improved molecules that show enhanced bactericidal action in vitro remains to be tested.

AB  == the seventh year of the zyvox annual appraisal of potency and spectrum program (2008) continues to monitor the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents tested against gram-positive pathogens in latin america, europe, canada, and the asia-pacific region. linezolid is an oxazolidinone approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by various gram-positive species including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). surveillance isolates were submitted from 64 medical centers (24 countries) for a total of 6121 strains. each country was requested to send 200 consecutive isolates in 6 targeted pathogen categories to a central processing laboratory, except the united kingdom, japan, and china where more strains were processed (400, 400, and 800, respectively). reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing methods were used to test the following organism groups: s. aureus (3240), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (748), enterococci (864), streptococcus pneumoniae (655), viridans group (297), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (317). eight linezolid-resistant (lzd-r) isolates were detected in 7 countries (italy [2], france, china, brazil, sweden, germany, and united kingdom) among the enterococci (enterococcus faecalis [3] and e. faecium [2]) and cons (3  staphylococcus epidermidis). five lzd-r isolates contained 23s rrna mutations (g2576t or g2447t), and 2 strains had undeterminable resistance mechanisms. one cons (italy) contained the mobile cfr gene. vancomycin-resistant enterococci rates ranged from 0.0% in several countries to 59.4% in taiwan. all streptococci  were linezolid susceptible (mic(90), 1 microg/ml). in conclusion, the activity of linezolid remained uniform and stable across the sampled geographic regions studied when compared to the 2006 to 2007 results. documented lzd-r remains rare  (only 0.13% overall but highest for cons [0.41%] and enterococci [0.69%]) among the 24 countries sampled for the 6 different pathogen groups. rates of clindamycin resistance and the frequency of mrsa varied by geographic region and  between nations; therefore, like oxazolidinones, it requires continued surveillance for changing resistance patterns.

TI  == isolation and activity of two antibacterial biflavonoids from leaf extracts of garcinia livingstonei (clusiaceae).
AB  == the antibacterial activity of the acetone extract of garcinia livingstonei leaves was studied using bioautography and by determining the minimum antibacterial concentration against four nosocomial pathogens. bioautograms showed that two compounds were mainly responsible for the antibacterial activity. these were isolated by a combination of solvent-solvent fractionation and bioassay-guided chromatographic fractionation and were characterized by 1h nmr, 13c nmr and 2d nmr spectroscopy as amentoflavone and 4"-methoxy amentoflavone. the antibacterial activity of the isolated compounds was determined against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. three of the tested organisms were sensitive to both compounds with mic values ranging from 8-100 microg/ml. p. aeruginosa was resistant with mics > 100 microg/ml. the  safety of the two compounds was assessed with a tetrazolium based colorimetric assay (mtt assay) using vero monkey kidney cells. the compounds had low toxicity  against the cell line with cytotoxic concentrations to 50% of the cells (ld50) of 386 microg/ml and > 600 microg/ml for amentoflavone and 4"-methoxy amentoflavone, respectively. berberine, the positive control had a cc50 of 170 microg/ml. 4"-methoxy amentoflavone was more active and much less toxic than amentoflavone.

TI  == impact of a change in antibiotic prophylaxis on total antibiotic use in a surgical intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of reducing the length of antibiotic prophylaxis for cerebro spinal shunts on total antibiotic use and key resistant pathogens. methods: in january 2004, the use of antibiotic  prophylaxis was reduced to a single shot dose with cefuroxime in an intensive care unit (icu). prior to this intervention, prophylaxis with second-generation cephalosporins was administered during the entire period of external cerebro spinal fluid (csf) drainage. the effect on the antibiotic use density (ad: ddd [defined daily doses] per 1,000 patient-days[pd]) was calculated prior to (january 2002-december 2003) and following implementation of the intervention(january 2004-december 2006) by segmented regression analysis of an interrupted time series. resistance proportions(rp) and resistance densities (rd), defined as resistant pathogen/1,000 pd of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis or e. faecium, third-generation-resistant (3gc) escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant pseudomonus aeruginosa, were compared by the fisher's exact test before and after the intervention. results: total antibiotic  use by 147 ddd/1,000 pd decreased after the intervention when pre-operative prophylaxis was changed into single shot prophylaxis, from an estimated mean of 1,036 ddd/1,000 pd before the intervention to 887ddd/1,000 pd post-intervention.  this decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in the amount of cefuroxime used for prophylaxis. the reduction in total antibiotic consumption was sustainable, and it did not increase again during the next 36 months. the rr  and rd of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant e. coli increased after january 2004, whereas the percentage of mrsa significantly decreased. conclusion: change to single shot prophylaxis along with an ongoing antibiotic stewardship program resulted in a cut-back in total antibiotic use amounting to as much as 15%. it would therefore appear that targeting interventions aimed at reducing antibiotic prophylaxis in surgical icus may be very worthwhile.

TI  == antistaphylococcal effect of enterocin as-48 in bakery ingredients of vegetable origin, alone and in combination with selected antimicrobials.
AB  == the inhibitory effect of enterocin as-48 against staphylococcus aureus was investigated in various types of bakery ingredients. antibacterial activity greatly depended on the food substrate, ranging from complete inactivation of s.  aureus in liquid caramel (in which the bacterium survived poorly) to no significant inhibition (as in vanilla or chocolate creams). significant reductions of viable counts in the range of 1.8 to 2.7 log units (p < 0.05) were  achieved in substrates like pumpkin confiture or diluted almond cream stored at temperatures of 10 or 22 degrees c. given the very low activity detected in chocolate substrates, enterocin as-48 was tested in combination with other antimicrobials. bactericidal activity increased markedly for the combinations of  as-48 and 0.1% eugenol (v/v), 0.5% 2-nitropropanol (v/v), or 3% nisaplin (w/v). enterocin as-48 could be applied in combination with other antimicrobials for preservation of bakery ingredients against s. aureus.

TI  == [in vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,919 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2007].
AB  == we have reported in this journal in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics every year since 1992. in this paper, we report the results of an  analysis of in vitro susceptibilities of 12,919 clinical isolates from 72 centers in japan to selected antibiotics in 2007 compared with the results from previous  years. the common respiratory pathogens, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae maintained a high susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (fqs). the resistance of s. pyogenes to macrolides has been increasing every year and this was especially clear this year. most strains of enterobacteriaceae except for escherichia coli showed a high susceptibility to fqs. almost 30% of e. coli strains were resistant to fqs and the resistance increased further this year. fqs resistance of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was approximately 95% with the exception of 45% for sitafloxacin (stfx). fqs resistance of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) was low at about 10%. fqs resistance of  methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (mrcns) was higher than that of methicillin-susceptible coagulase negative staphylococci (mscns), but it  was lower than that of mrsa. however, fqs resistance of mscns was higher than that of mssa. fqs resistance of enterococcus faecalis was 22.5% to 29.6%, while that of enterococcusfaecium was more than 85% except for stfx (58.3%). in clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa derived from urinary tract infections, fqs resistance was 21-27%, which was higher than that of p. aeruginosa from respiratory tract infections at 13-21%, which was the same trend  as in past years. multidrug resistant strains accounted for 5.6% in the urinary tract and 1.8% in the respiratory tract. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. the carbapenem resistant strains, which present a problem  at present, accounted for 2.7%. neisseria gonorrhoeae showed high resistance of 86-88% to fqs. the results of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and n.  gonorrhoeae showed resistance tendencies, and other species maintained high susceptibility rates more than 90% against fqs, which have been used clinically for over 15 years.

TI  == suicide and fratricide in bacterial biofilms.
AB  == bacterial autolysis has recently been identified as a key mechanism that regulates different phases of biofilm development including microcolony formation and dispersal. however such autolytic measures are limited to a subfraction of cells within the entire biofilm population. here we speculate on the role biofilm heterogeneity plays in limiting autolysis within biofilms and further describe the molecular regulation of suicidal and fratricidal mechanisms in biofilm development of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis.

TI  == characterization of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. isolated from us west coast public marine beaches.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (mrcons) from marine water and intertidal  beach sand from public beaches in washington state, usa. methods: fifty-one staphylococci from washington state beaches were characterized using antimicrobial susceptibility testing, carriage of acquired tetracycline and/or macrolide resistance genes, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (sccmec) typing, the bbl crystal gram-positive id system and/or 16s rrna sequencing, coagulase test and multilocus sequence typing (mlst) for mrsa. results: five multidrug-resistant mrsa sccmec type i, of which three were mlst type st45, one st59 and one a new mlst type, st1405, plus one susceptible non-typeable (nt) mrsa st30 were characterized. thirty-three mrcons isolates, representing 21 strains from 9 staphylococcus spp., carried a range of sccmec types [i (2), ii (6), iii (3), v (2), i/ii (1) and nt (7)] and varied in their antibiotic susceptibility to other antibiotic classes and carriage of acquired tetracycline/macrolide resistance gene(s). mrsa and mrcons donors co-transferred tet(m) and erm(a) genes to an enterococcus faecalis recipient at a frequency of 10(-8). conclusions: this is the first report of mrsa and mrcons isolated from marine water and intertidal  beach sand. the mlst types and antibiotic carriage of five mrsa isolates were similar to hospital mrsa isolates rather than us community-acquired mrsa isolates. our results suggest that public marine beaches may be a reservoir for transmission of mrsa to beach visitors as well as an ecosystem for exchange of antibiotic resistance genes among staphylococci and related genera.

TI  == propagation of anaerobic bacteria within an aerobic multi-species chronic wound biofilm model.
AB  == objective: most chronic wound biofilms have been shown to have significant populations of anaerobes. in order to better screen antimicrobial and antibiofilm therapeutics, we evaluated the ability of key anaerobes to incorporate and propagate within our aerobic chronic wound biofilm. method: we had previously developed a rapid model to simulate polymicrobial chronic wound biofilms. this model incorporated meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre) and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the  model was used along with a variety of anaerobes to determine whether this biofilm model would support propagation of anaerobes similar to that we have identified in chronic wounds. results: using our previously defined lubbock chronic wound biofilm (lcwb) model combined with quantitative pcr, anaerobic bacteria were shown to proliferate through integration into the biofilm under aerobic conditions. using electron microscopy we show close association between aerobes and anaerobes within the biofilm suggesting a synergistic relationship. conclusion: we have expanded the utility of the lcbw to show the ability of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria to thrive in aerobic conditions. the expansion of this model can further simulate the functional characteristics of chronic wound pathogenic biofilms and the species that dwell within them allowing improved ability to evaluate therapeutics that target anaerobes.

TI  == assessment of antimicrobial resistance transfer between lactic acid bacteria and  potential foodborne pathogens using in vitro methods and mating in a food matrix.
AB  == the transferability of antimicrobial resistance from lactic acid bacteria (lab) to potential pathogenic strains was studied using in vitro methods and mating in  a food matrix. five lab donors containing either erythromycin or tetracycline resistance markers on transferable elements were conjugally mated with lab (enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis) and pathogenic strains (listeria spp., salmonella ssp., staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli). in vitro transfer experiments were carried out with the donors and recipients using both the filter and plate mating methods. the food matrix consisted of fermented whole milk (fermented with the lab donors) with the pathogenic recipients added as contaminants during the production process. all transconjugants were confirmed by phenotypic and molecular methods. erythromycin resistance transfer from lab strains to listeria spp. was observed using both in vitro mating methods at high  transfer frequencies of up to 5.1 x 10(-4) transconjugants per recipient. also, high frequency transfer (ranging from 2.7 x 10(-8) up to 1.1 x 10(-3) transconjugants per recipient) of both erythromycin and tetracycline-resistance was observed between lab species using in vitro methods. no resistance transfer was observed to salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, and e. coli. the only conjugal transfer observed in the fermented milk matrix was for tetracycline resistance between two lab strains (at a transfer frequency of 2.6 x 10(-7) transconjugants per recipients). this study demonstrates the transfer of antimicrobial resistance from lab to listeria spp. using in vitro methods and also the transfer of resistance between lab species in a food matrix. it highlights the involvement of lab as a potential source of resistance determinants that may be disseminated between lab and pathogenic strains including listeria spp. furthermore, it indicates that food matrices such as fermented milks may provide a suitable environment to support gene exchange.

TI  == is there an association between nosocomial infection rates and bacterial cross transmissions?
AB  == objective: surveillance data of nosocomial infection rates are increasingly used  for public reporting and interhospital comparisons. approximately 15% of nosocomial infections on intensive care units are the result of patient-to-patient transmissions of the causative organisms. these exogenous infections could be prevented by adherence to basic infection control measures. the association between bacterial cross transmissions and nosocomial infection rates was analyzed. design: prospective cohort study during 24 months. setting: eleven intensive care units from two university hospitals. patients: all inpatients. interventions: none. measurements and main results: primary isolates  of six indicator organisms (acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus) cultured from clinical samples or methicillin-resistant s. aureus surveillance testing of all inpatients were genotyped. indistinguishable isolates in > or =2 patients defined potential episodes of transmissions. surveillance of nosocomial  infection rates was performed according to the german nosocomial infection surveillance system, krankenhaus infektions surveillance system. transmission events and nosocomial infection rates were pooled by intensive care unit to calculate spearman's rank-correlation test. during 100,781 patient days, 100,829  microbiological specimens from 24,362 patients were sampled (average investigation density: 1.0 sample per patient and day) and 3419 primary indicator organisms were cultured. altogether, 462 transmissions (incidence density of 4.6  transmissions per 1000 patient days; range, 1.4-8.4 days) and 1216 nosocomial infections (incidence density of 12.1 per 1000 patient days; range, 6.2-16.6 days) were discerned. correlation analysis was unable to reveal any association between the incidence of cross transmissions and nosocomial infections, duration  of hospitalization, or device use. conclusions: differences in nosocomial infection rates between study intensive care units are not explained solely by cross transmissions. other factors, like the severity of the patient's underlying diseases, the patient's endogenous flora, or invasive procedures, likely have a dominant effect on the magnitude of nosocomial infection rates.

AB  == traditional medicine has a key role in health care worldwide. obtaining scientific information about the efficacy and safety of the plants from our region is one of the goals of our research group. in this report, 17 plants were  selected and collected in different localities from northeast mexico. the dried plants were separated into leaves, flowers, fruit, stems, roots and bark. each part was extracted with methanol, and 39 crude extracts were prepared. the extracts were tested for their antimicrobial activity using three gram-negative bacterial strains (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii), three gram-positive bacterial strains (enterococcus faecalis and two staphylococcus aureus strains), and seven clinically isolated yeasts (candida albicans, c. krusei, c. tropicalis, c. parapsilosis and c. glabrata); their antioxidant activity was tested using a dpph free radical assay. no activity against gram-negative bacteria was observed with any extract up to the maximum concentration tested, 1000 mug ml(-1). we report here for the first time activity of ceanothus coeruleus against s. aureus (flowers, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) 125 mug ml(-1)), c. glabrata (mics 31.25 mug ml(-1)) and c. parapsilosis (mics between 31.25 and 125 mug ml(-1)); chrysanctinia mexicana against c. glabrata (mics 31.25 mug ml(-1)); colubrina greggii against e. faecalis (mics 250 mug ml(-1)) and cordia boissieri against c. glabrata (mic 125 mug ml(-1)). furthermore, this is the first report about antioxidant activity of extracts from ceanothus coeruleus, chrysanctinia mexicana, colubrina greggii and cyperus alternifolius. some correlation could exist between antioxidant activity and antiyeast activity against yeasts in the species ceanothus coeruleus, schinus molle, colubrina greggii and cordia boissieri.

TI  == microbiology of drugs for treating multiply drug-resistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == several new antimicrobials demonstrate in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), and other gram-positive bacteria. data from large surveys indicate that linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline are almost universally active against mrsa. linezolid and tigecycline inhibit both enterococcus faecium  and enterococcus faecalis at low concentrations; daptomycin is somewhat more potent against the latter. the investigational agents dalbavancin and telavancin  are more potent than vancomycin against vancomycin-susceptible organisms. dalbavancin inhibits vanb type vre at low concentrations, but is not active against vana type vre. telavancin is less active against vre than against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci, but minimum inhibitory concentrations are lower than those of vancomycin against vre. with continued careful use of available antimicrobials, the vast majority of these organisms should remain susceptible to 1 or more of the agents discussed for the foreseeable future.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria isolated from us medical centers: results of the daptomycin surveillance program (2007-2008).
AB  == gram-positive bacterial strains (12 443) consecutively collected during 2007 to 2008 in hospitals located in the united states were tested by reference broth microdilution methods against daptomycin and comparison agents. methicillin (oxacillin) resistance rates were 55.9% and 74.0% for staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively, and the vancomycin resistance rate among enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium were 5.4% and 75.4%, respectively. daptomycin was very active against all gram-positive species with mic(90) values of 0.5, 0.25, 0.5, and 2 microg/ml for staphylococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci, respectively. overall, 99.9% of s. aureus, 100.0% of e. faecalis, and 99.5% of e. faecium were susceptible to daptomycin. in addition, daptomycin mic distributions for s. aureus and enterococci from 2007 to 2008 were very similar to those from 2002 to 2003. in summary, high rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci were observed in us hospitals, but daptomycin remains active against these clinically important gram-positive organisms with no evidence of potency loss since its approval for clinical use in late 2003.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity profile of oritavancin against recent gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. organisms were staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664),  enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), enterococcus faecium (n = 819), streptococcus  pyogenes (n = 959), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group c, g, and f streptococci (n = 84), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. the vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among s. pneumoniae isolates. among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. the maximum oritavancin mic against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the mic(90) against s. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. against e. faecalis and e. faecium, oritavancin mic(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including vana strains (n = 486), with mic(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against vana e. faecium and e. faecalis, respectively. oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); mic(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. these data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. the data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.

TI  == assay of enterocin as-48 for inhibition of foodborne pathogens in desserts.
AB  == enterocin as-48 was tested against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and listeria monocytogenes in different kinds of desserts. the highest activity against s. aureus was detected in baker cream. however, in yogurt-type soy-based  desserts and in gelatin pudding, as-48 (175 arbitrary units [au]/g) reduced viable cell counts of s. aureus by only 1.5 to 1.8 log units at most. the efficacy of as-48 in puddings greatly depended on inoculum size, and viable s. aureus counts decreased below detection levels within 24 h for inocula lower than 4 to 5.5 log cfu/g. for l. monocytogenes, bacteriocin concentrations of 52.5 to 87.5 au/g reduced viable counts below detection levels and avoided regrowth of survivors. the lowest activity was detected in yogurt-type desserts. for b. cereus, viable cell counts were reduced below detection levels for bacteriocin concentrations of 52.5 au/g in instant pudding without soy or by 175 au/g in the  soy pudding. in gelatin pudding, as-48 (175 au/g) reduced viable cell counts of b. cereus below detection levels after 8 h at 10 degrees c or after 48 h at 22 degrees c. bacteriocin addition also inhibited gelatin liquefaction caused by the proteolytic activity of b. cereus.

TI  == effect of mixed antimicrobial agents and flavors in active packaging films.
AB  == active packaging is an emerging food technology to improve the quality and safety of food products. many works have been developed to study the antimicrobial activity of essential oils. essential oils have been traditionally used as flavorings in food, so they have an important odor impact but they have as well antimicrobial properties that could be used to protect the food. recent developments in antimicrobial active packaging showed the efficiency of essential oils versus bread and bakery products among other applications. however, one of the main problems to face is the odor and taste they could provide to the packaged food. using some aromas to mask the odor could be a good approach. that  is why the main objective of this paper is to develop an antimicrobial packaging  material based on the combination of the most active compounds of essential oils  (hydrocinnamaldehyde, oregano essential oil, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol) together with some aromas commonly used in the food industry. a study  of the concentration required to get the antimicrobial properties, the organoleptic compatibility with typical aroma present in many food systems (vanilla, banana, and strawberry), and the right combination of both systems has  been carried out. antimicrobial tests of both the mentioned aromas, the main components of some essential oils, and the combination of both groups were carried out against bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella choleraesuis, yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli), yeasts (candida albicans, debaryomyces hansenii, zygosaccharomyces rouxii), and molds (botrytis cinerae, aspergillus flavus, penicillium roqueforti, eurotium repens, penicillium islandicum, penicillium commune, penicillium nalgiovensis). the sensory properties of the combinations were evaluated with a triangular test and classification was by an order test; the odor threshold of the aroma compounds was also studied. the results reveal that none of the aromas had antimicrobial properties. the most antimicrobial compounds are thymol, carvacrol, and cinnamaldehyde, but none of them could be combined with banana aroma, whereas only thymol with strawberry aroma gave the right combined organoleptic profile. all of the antimicrobials under study could be combined with vanilla aroma, providing both antimicrobial property and the odor expected.

TI  == trends in udder health and emerging mastitogenic pathogens in south african dairy herds.
AB  == the aim of this study was to retrospectively analyse the results of milk samples  obtained from south african dairy herds during the period 1996 to april 2007 in order to identify possible trends in isolates of microorganisms and their pathogenicity under field conditions. milk samples were obtained from 7 of the 9  provinces in south africa where there are low numbers of dairy cows. although there is scientific limitation to a country wide survey, such as the variation in herd size, management skills, parity, milk yield, milking frequency and other parameters, the size of this database helps to give a fair indication of general  udder health in south africa. cytology and routine bacteriology were performed on 379,000 milk samples of lactating cows and bacteriology on 11,946 samples from non-lactating cows. according to the results obtained, mastitis did not decrease  in south africa over the test period. the prevalence of mastitis and teat canal infection was lowest in 2002. mastitis and teat canal infection increased from 2002 to 2006 from 8.1% and 24.1% to 15.4 and 30.0% respectively. the percentage of mastitogenic pathogens isolated from cows over these years also varied. previously unknown or almost eradicated mastitogenic pathogens such as alphabeta  haemolytic staphylococcus aureus which is thought to be of human origin, streptococcus agalactiae and enterococcus canis were responsible for numerous mastitis outbreaks seen in the test samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently isolated bacteria in milk samples from both lactating and dry cows, followed by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus agalactiae. although staphylococcus aureus remained the principal mastitogenic pathogen in south africa, owing to its chronic nature and resultant economic losses, most cases of mastitis were caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. this finding increases the importance of coagulase-negative staphylococci (formerly described  as a minor pathogen) significantly. isolations of streptococcus agalactiae peaked between 2000 and 2005 and decreased again by 2007. coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates increased from 2002 and were still on the increase in 2007. streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus canis were  isolated more frequently from milk samples of lactating cows compared with dry cows, while enterococcus faecalis was isolated more frequently from dry cow samples.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of hm-242, a novel antiseptic compound.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of n(4)-octyl-6,6-dimethyl-n(2)-(4-methylbenzyl)-1,6-dihydro-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diam ine (hm-242), a novel synthetic compound, were compared with those of chlorhexidine gluconate (chg). hm-242 was a more potent microbicide than chg in vitro; however, its minimal inhibitory concentrations were similar. in particular, hm-242 killed various gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, both efficiently and rapidly. hm-242 also showed potent virucidal activity against enveloped viruses such as influenza virus and herpes simplex virus. these characteristics suggest that hm-242 may well be useful as an antiseptic.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo properties of dihydrophthalazine antifolates, a novel family of antibacterial drugs.
AB  == racemic 2,4-diaminopyrimidine dihydrophthalazine derivatives bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 exhibited low in vitro mics toward small, selected panels of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae,  moraxella catarrhalis, and mycobacterium avium, though the compounds were less active against haemophilus influenzae. the constellation of dihydrofolate reductases (dhfrs) present in 20 enterococci and 40 staphylococci was analyzed and correlated with the antibacterial activities of the dihydrophthalazines and trimethoprim. dhfrs encoded by dfrb, dfra (s1 isozyme), dfre, and fola were susceptible to the dihydrophthalazines, whereas dhfrs encoded by dfrg (s3 isozyme) and dfrf were not. studies with the separated enantiomers of bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 revealed preferential inhibition of susceptible dhfrs  by the (r)-enantiomers. bal0030543, bal0030544, and bal0030545 were well tolerated by mice during 5- and 10-day oral toxicity studies at doses of up to 400 mg/kg of body weight. using a nonoptimized formulation, the dihydrophthalazines displayed acceptable oral bioavailabilities in mice, and efficacy studies with a septicemia model of mice infected with trimethoprim-resistant, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus gave 50% effective dose values in the range of 1.6 to 6.25 mg/kg.

TI  == identification and characterization of a family of toxin-antitoxin systems related to the enterococcus faecalis plasmid pad1 par addiction module.
AB  == the par locus of the enterococcus faecalis plasmid pad1 is an rna-regulated addiction module encoding the peptide toxin fst. homology searches revealed that  fst belongs to a family of at least nine related peptides encoded on the chromosomes and plasmids of six different gram-positive bacterial species. comparison of an alignment of these peptides with the results of a saturation mutagenesis analysis indicated regions of the peptides important for biological function. examination of the genetic context of the fst genes revealed that all of these peptides are encoded within par-like loci with conserved features similar to pad1 par. all four ent. faecalis family members were demonstrated to produce the expected toxin-encoding and regulatory rna products. the locus from the ent. faecalis plasmid pams1 was demonstrated to function as an addiction module and fst was shown to be toxic to staphylococcus aureus, suggesting that a  plasmid-encoded module in that species is performing the same function. thus, the pad1-encoded par locus appears to be the prototype of a family of related loci found in several gram-positive species.

TI  == ceftobiprole: a new broad spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == ceftobiprole, formerly designated bal9141/ro 63-9141, is a pyrrolidinone-3-ylidene-methyl cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity  against mrsa, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. ceftobiprole has a low potential for inducing chromosomal ampc beta-lactamases but it is hydrolyzed by most extended spectrum beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamases. glomerular filtration is predominantly responsible for removal of the free drug from the systemic circulation. the efficacy of ceftobiprole in the treatment of complicated skin and ski-structure infections has been recently demonstrated in two phase iii randomized clinical trials involving 1600 patients. two other phase iii clinical trials to assess ceftobiprole's efficacy in community-acquired pneumonia and nosocomial pneumonia  have also concluded. while the drug met the noninferiority criteria for community-acquired pneumonia and nosocomial pneumonia involving non-ventilator associated pneumonia, ceftobiprole was less effective than the comparator in ventilator associated pneumonia subjects. ceftobiprole was well tolerated with a  safety profile consistent with the cephalosporin class of antibiotic. the most frequent drug-related adverse event was dysgeusia. ceftobiprole is intended for use in the hospital for the treatment of infections that frequently involve beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.

TI  == murf inhibitors with antibacterial activity: effect on muropeptide levels.
AB  == murf catalyzes the last cytoplasmic step of bacterial cell wall synthesis and is  essential for bacterial survival. our previous studies used a pharmacophore model of a murf inhibitor to identify additional inhibitors with improved properties. we now present the characterization of two such inhibitors, the diarylquinolines  dq1 and dq2. dq1 inhibited escherichia coli murf (50% inhibitory concentration, 24 microm) and had modest activity (mics, 8 to 16 microg/ml) against lipopolysaccharide (lps)-defective e. coli and wild-type e. coli rendered permeable with polymyxin b nonapeptide. dq2 additionally displayed activity against gram-positive bacteria (mics, 8 to 16 microg/ml), including methicillin (meticillin)-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium isolates. treatment of lps-defective e. coli cells with >or=2x mic of dq1 resulted in a 75-fold-greater accumulation of the murf substrate compared to the  control, a 70% decline in the amount of the murf product, and eventual cell lysis, consistent with the inhibition of murf within bacteria. dq2 treatment of s. aureus resulted in similar effects on the murf substrate and product quantities. at lower levels of dq1 (<or=1x mic), the level of accumulation of the substrate was less pronounced (15-fold greater compared to the amount for the control). however, a 50% increase in the amount of the murf product compared to the control was reproducibly observed, consistent with the possible upregulation  of muropeptide biosynthesis upon partial inhibition of this pathway. the overexpression of cloned murf appeared to partly alleviate the dq1-mediated inhibition of muropeptide synthesis. the identification of murf inhibitors such as dq1 and dq2 that disrupt cell wall biosynthesis suggests that murf remains a viable target for an antibacterial agent.

TI  == ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssi), including those caused by meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and community-acquired pneumonia (cap). ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (pbp)2a, an mrsa-specific pbp that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. the high binding affinity of  ceftaroline to pbp2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/ml) correlates  well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for mrsa. ceftaroline is active in vitro against gram-positive cocci, including mrsa, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (not e. faecium). the broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or ampc-derepressed enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug)  is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. for multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/ml and 21.0 microg/ml for first and  last dose, respectively. ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 l/kg (28.3 l), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. no drug  accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through  renal excretion (49.6%). based on monte carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. a phase ii study randomized 100 patients with csssi to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. in a phase iii trial, 702 patients with csssi were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating csssi caused by both gram-positive and -negative pathogens. adverse event rates were similar between groups. ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is  consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for csssi and cap, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == antibacterial protection by enterocin as-48 in sport and energy drinks with less  acidic ph values.
AB  == the low ph and acid content found in sports and energy drinks are a matter of concern in dental health. raising the ph may solve this problem, but at the same  time increase the risks of spoilage or presence of pathogenic bacteria. in the present study, commercial energy drinks were adjusted to ph 5.0 and challenged with listeria monocytogenes (drinks a to f), staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and bacillus licheniformis (drink a) during storage at 37 degrees c. l. monocytogenes was able to grow in drink a and survived in drinks d and f for at least 2 days. addition of enterocin as-48 (1 microg/ml final concentration) rapidly inactivated l. monocytogenes in all drinks tested. s. aureus and b. cereus also survived quite well in drink a, and were completely inactivated by 12.5 microg/ml enterocin as-48 after 2 days of storage or by 25 microg/ml bacteriocin after 1 day. b. licheniformis was able to multiply in drink a, but it was completely inactivated by 5 microg/ml enterocin as-48 after 2 days of storage or by 12.5 microg/ml bacteriocin after 1 day. results from the present study suggest that enterocin as-48 could be used as a natural preservative against these target bacteria in less acidic sport and energy drinks.

TI  == combinatorial expression of bacterial whole mevalonate pathway for the production of beta-carotene in e. coli.
AB  == the increased synthesis of building blocks of ipp (isopentenyl diphosphate) and dmapp (dimethylallyl diphosphate) through metabolic engineering is a way to enhance the production of carotenoids. using e. coli as a host, ipp and dmapp supply can be increased significantly through the introduction of foreign mva (mevalonate) pathway into it. the mva pathway is split into two parts with the top and bottom portions supplying mevalonate from acetyl-coa, and ipp and dmapp from mevalonate, respectively. the bottom portions of mva pathway from streptococcus pneumonia, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and saccharomyces cerevisiae were compared with exogenous  mevalonate supplementation for beta-carotene production in recombinant escherichia coli harboring beta-carotene synthesis genes. the e. coli harboring the bottom mva pathway of s. pneumoniae produced the highest amount of beta-carotene. the top portions of mva pathway were also compared and the top mva pathway of e. faecalis was found out to be the most efficient for mevalonate production in e. coli. the whole mva pathway was constructed by combining the bottom and top portions of mva pathway of s. pneumoniae and e. faecalis, respectively. the recombinant e. coli harboring the whole mva pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced high amount of beta-carotene even without  exogenous mevalonate supplementation. when comparing various e. coli strains - mg1655, dh5alpha, s17-1, xl1-blue and bl21 - the dh5alpha was found to be the best beta-carotene producer. using glycerol as the carbon source for beta-carotene production was found to be superior to glucose, galactose, xylose and maltose. the recombinant e. coli dh5alpha harboring the whole mva pathway and beta-carotene synthesis genes produced beta-carotene of 465mg/l at glycerol concentration of 2% (w/v).

TI  == sonication is superior to scraping for retrieval of bacteria in biofilm on titanium and steel surfaces in vitro.
AB  == background and purpose: low-virulence implant infections are characterized by bacterial colonization of the implant with subsequent biofilm formation. in these cases, soft tissue biopsies often prove to be culture negative. consequently, detachment of the causative adherent bacteria is crucial for correct microbiological diagnosis. using an in vitro model, we compared 4 methods of biofilm sampling from metal surfaces. methods: discs of titanium and steel were incubated in the presence of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and propionibacterium acnes in mueller hinton broth. non-adherent bacteria were removed by repeated rinsing of the discs. 10 parallels of each disc were subjected to 1 of 4 methods for bacterial recovery: (a) sonication of the discs, (b) scraping of the discs using surgical blades followed by streaking of the blades onto agar plates, (c) scraping of the discs followed by vortex mixing of the surgical blades, and (d) scraping of the discs followed by sonication of the surgical blades. quantitative bacterial cultures were performed for each sampling method. results: with the exception of s. epidermidis on steel, sonication efficiently and reliably dislodged biofilm bacteria. the scraping methods employed did not detach bacteria embedded in biofilm. interpretation: scraping of metal surfaces is not an adequate method for sampling of biofilm bacteria in vitro.

TI  == time-kill kinetics of oritavancin and comparator agents against staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium.
AB  == objectives: oritavancin, a lipoglycopeptide, possesses bactericidal activity against gram-positive bacteria including vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococci. to understand the time dependence of oritavancin activity, we have undertaken time-kill experiments against isolates of s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, including recent antibiotic-resistant strains. methods: six strains of s. aureus [methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), vancomycin-resistant s. aureus  (vrsa)] and five strains of enterococci [vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (vse) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre; both vana and vanb)] were tested in time-kill assays; oritavancin assays included 0.002% polysorbate-80 to ensure quantitative drug recovery. oritavancin and comparators vancomycin, teicoplanin,  linezolid and daptomycin were tested at static concentrations approximating their free peak (fc(max)) and free trough (fc(min)) in plasma when administered at standard doses for complicated skin and skin structure infections. results: oritavancin showed concentration-dependent killing of all strains tested: at its  fc(max) predicted from a 200 mg dose in humans, oritavancin exerted bactericidal  activity (> or =3 log kill relative to starting inoculum) against mssa, mrsa and  vrsa within 1 h and against vse between 11 and 24 h. at predicted fc(max) from an 800 mg dose, oritavancin was bactericidal against visa strains at 24 h and against vre at 10 h. conclusions: oritavancin displayed concentration-dependent killing of mssa, mrsa, vrsa, visa, vse and vre. oritavancin was more rapidly bactericidal against all strains tested than were vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid or daptomycin at physiologically relevant concentrations. these data support the conclusion that oritavancin exerts concentration-dependent bactericidal activity on recent, drug-resistant isolates of s. aureus and enterococci.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of doripenem tested against prevalent gram-positive pathogens: results from a global surveillance study (2003-2007).
AB  == doripenem is a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem recently approved in the united states for treatment of complicated urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections. although pronounced doripenem antimicrobial activity against various  gram-negative pathogens, including anaerobes, has been confirmed, limited information has been forthcoming on the activity of this agent against leading gram-positive species. we evaluated the activity of doripenem using reference broth microdilution procedures against a large collection of staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci collected as part of a global (north america, 43.0%; latin america, 11.7%; europe, 31.3%; and asia-pacific, 14.0%) doripenem surveillance program for the years 2003 to 2007. doripenem was confirmed to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (22 389 isolates) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2444 isolates; mic(90) values, <or=0.06 microg/ml), with no differences noted between geographic regions. against enterococcus faecalis (8714 isolates), doripenem displayed modest activity (mic(50), 4 microg/ml) but was largely inactive against enterococcus faecium (4233 isolates). although not currently approved for treatment of respiratory tract infections in the united states, doripenem was highly active against streptococcus pneumoniae (10 260 isolates; mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml) and 2-fold more active than either ceftriaxone or cefepime. doripenem activity was even more noteworthy against beta-hemolytic streptococci (4598 isolates; mic(90), <or=0.06 microg/ml, similar to that of penicillin) and viridans group streptococci (1887 isolates; mic(90), 0.25 microg/ml). doripenem appears broadly  active in vitro against gram-positive pathogens, a potency similar to that of other carbapenems, a distinct advantage that complements other attributes including beta-lactamase and dehydropeptidase stability and activity against emerging multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == prevention of death in bacterium-infected mice by a synthetic antimicrobial peptide, l5, through activation of host immunity.
AB  == in our previous study, we found that the antibacterial peptide klklllllklk-nh(2)  (l5) and its d-enantiomer (dl5) activate neutrophils to produce superoxide anions (o(2)(-)) and prevent death due to infection by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, suggesting that these peptides may elicit in vivo antimicrobial activities through host inflammatory responses mediated by neutrophils. in this study, we investigated the mechanisms behind in vivo antimicrobial prophylaxis by the use of l5 for the treatment of bacterial infection introduced via intra-abdominal implantation. we found that the intraperitoneal treatment with l5 before bacterial infection markedly reduced rates of death due to infection. treatments with l5 were highly effective in preventing death due to intraperitoneal inoculation of not only s. aureus smith but also enterococcus faecalis sr1004 and escherichia coli ec14. the intra-abdominal administration of l5 induced accumulation of neutrophils, increased levels of reactive oxygen species, and augmented antibacterial activity in the abdominal cavity. in addition, administration of l5 upregulated the expression of the mig/cxcl9 chemokine gene in thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages. our results suggested that the prevention of death by treatment of infected mice with l5 might occur primarily through the activation of a host immune response.

TI  == the antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  == acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. the main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused  by organisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa. this study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect  of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (hibicet). former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. to cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial  strains were tested: escherichia coli, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii,  enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and beta-haemolytic streptococcus group a and b. the tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii. the microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested  at a low concentration of 3%. in comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. an evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic  acid is currently underway. it can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.

TI  == clinical investigation of isolated bacteria from urinary tracts of hospitalized patients and their susceptibilities to antibiotics.
AB  == complicated urinary tract infections (utis) are often difficult to treat, partly  because of the existence of isolated antibiotic-resistant strains. even though the definition of uti is determined by the quantity of cultured bacteria, it has  been unclear if the quantity of cultured uti bacteria affects their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. also, the gram stain is generally performed to assume the causative bacteria and their quantity before culture results can be obtained; therefore, we could start to use effective antibiotics if the relationship between bacterial quantity and resistance to antimicrobial agents were clear. we studied patients diagnosed as having complicated utis at the urological department in kobe university hospital between june 2002 and march 2003 and analyzed the relationships between the quantity of cultured bacteria and their antimicrobial mics for antibiotics. the most commonly isolated bacteria were serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. there was no significant correlation between the quantity of cultured bacteria and antimicrobial mics in all the bacteria and antibiotics that we tested, suggesting that resistant phenotype, but not inoculum of the organism, did determine resistance to antibiotics. in conclusion, our investigation suggested the total number of isolated bacteria in  urine culture did not determine the mics and that inoculum of the bacteria might  be important for this determination.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of rep3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-trna synthetase (metrs) in development for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection. methods: the spectrum of activity of rep3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of c. difficile and  non-target organisms. the mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. results: rep3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of c. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant bi/nap1/027 strains (mic range=0.5-1 mg/l and mic(90) = 1  mg/l). the spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic gram-positive cocci such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (mic(90)s < 1 mg/l), but rep3123 was not active against most gram-negative bacteria. rep3123 targeted c. difficile metrs with a calculated inhibition constant (k(i)) of 0.020 nm, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic metrs. the specific mode  of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by rep3123, and by mets overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in mic for rep3123. spontaneous rep3123-resistant mutants of c. difficile (mics, 4-128 mg/l) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the mets gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. most of the metrs substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target c. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.

TI  == biological activity evaluation of the oils from laurus nobilis of tunisia and algeria extracted by supercritical carbon dioxide.
AB  == isolation of essential oil from dried and ground leaves of laurus nobilis l. from algeria and tunisia were obtained with two different methods: by means of classical hydrodistillation (hd) and by using carbon dioxide in the supercritical state (sfe). the effect of extraction pressure on the yield and composition of the l. nobilis volatile oil is examined. the best extraction conditions were as follows: pressure, 9.0 mpa; temperature, 323.15 k; 4 h of extraction and carbon dioxide flow, phi = 1.2 kg h(-1). waxes were entrapped in the first separator set at 9.0 mpa and 263.15 k. the oil was recovered in the second separator working at 2.0 bar and 288.15 k. gc/ms analysis of the leaves' volatile oil revealed that it mainly consisted of: 1,8-cineole, linalool, alpha-terpinyl acetate, methyl eugenol and sabinene. the comparison with the hydrodistilled oil did not reveal any big difference. the collection of samples at different extraction times during supercritical extraction allowed us to monitor the change of the oil composition. on the matrice exhaust owing to a sfe at 9.0 mpa, one further extraction at 323.15 k and 24.0 mpa was performed to obtain a mixture of compounds with higher molecular weight. finally, the antibacterial and antifungal activity of the various extracts has been assayed.

TI  == tr-700 in vitro activity against and resistance mutation frequencies among gram-positive pathogens.
AB  == background: tr-700, the active component of the oxazolidinone prodrug tr-701, has demonstrated potent activity against numerous gram-positive species. in this study, single-step mutation frequencies, passaging and the activity of tr-700 were tested against a worldwide collection of linezolid-non-susceptible organisms and matched controls. methods: one hundred and twenty linezolid-non-susceptible and 120 controls matched by genus/species, geographic origin, site of infection and time were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods. species of isolates were: enterococcus faecalis (16 linezolid non-susceptible/16  wild-type strains); enterococcus faecium (55/55), staphylococcus aureus (8/8); coagulase-negative staphylococci (at least 7 spp., 40/40) and viridans group streptococci (2 spp., 1/1). 23s rrna target mutations or cfr genes were detected  by pcr and sequencing. results: among linezolid-non-susceptible strains, the resistance mechanisms were g2576t (109), cfr (4) and unknown (7), with strains originating from europe, far east and north and south america. most strains were  multidrug-resistant and cfr isolates exhibited co-resistance to phenicols, clindamycin, linezolid, pleuromutilins and streptogramin b. tr-700 mic values, regardless of species, were 4-32-fold lower than those of linezolid. tr-700 mic results were < or = 4, < or = 8 or < or = 16 mg/l for 88%, 96% and > 99% of linezolid-non-susceptible strains, respectively. spontaneous single-step mutations were undetected (<1.1 x 10(-9)) and 14 day passaging studies produced modest tr-700 mic elevations compared with linezolid controls. conclusions: tr-700 exhibited enhanced activity against linezolid-non-susceptible and wild-type control strains of gram-positive cocci. a significant number (nearly 90%) of linezolid-non-susceptible strains were inhibited by potentially achievable levels (< or = 4 mg/l) of tr-700. all strains with the emerging cfr-mediated resistance determinant had tr-700 mic results at < or = 8 mg/l.

TI  == potential pathogens and effective disinfectants on public telephones at a large urban united states university.
AB  == telephones can carry potential bacterial pathogens, posing a risk for transfer of pathogens to users' hands. this study examined 25 mouthpieces of public telephones at a large urban u.s. university located in an area of rising incidence of community-acquired staphylococcal infections. coagaulase-negative staphylococci were most commonly isolated (64% of mouthpieces). potential pathogens isolated included staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus, and klebsiella ozaenae. the efficacy of disinfectants on reducing bacterial counts on telephone mouthpieces was also investigated. staphyloccocus aurens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcusfaecalis were inoculated onto mouthpieces and challenged with disinfectant wipes. bacterial counts were reduced substantially for all three organisms by wipes containing either 70% isopropyl alcohol, 1.84% sodium hypochlorite, or quaternary ammonium compounds. the sodium  hypochlorite-based cleaner demonstrated 100% efficacy at removing or killing test organisms from telephone mouthpieces. these data suggest that tested cleaners may be appropriate and needed for public telephone disinfection.

TI  == novel e. coli beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase iii inhibitors as targeted antibiotics.
AB  == beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase (kas) iii is a condensing enzyme that initiates fatty acid biosynthesis in most bacteria. we determined three pharmacophore maps from receptor-oriented pharmacophore-based in silico screening of the x-ray structure of escherichia coli kas iii (eckas iii) and choose 16 compounds as candidate eckas iii inhibitors. binding inhibitors were characterized using saturation-transfer difference nmr spectroscopy (std-nmr), and binding constants were determined with fluorescence quenching experiments. based on the results, we propose that the antimicrobial compound, 4-cyclohexyliminomethyl-benzene-1,3-diol (ykas3003), is a potent inhibitor of pathogenic kas iii, displaying minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values in the range 128-256 microg/ml against various bacteria.

TI  == endodontic microorganism susceptibility by direct contact test.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro the duration of the antimicrobial  effect of endodontic sealers by means of the direct contact test. the sealers tested were: endomethasone - septodont, endomethasone c-septodont, endion-voco, diaket-espe, pulp canal sealer-sybronendo, and ah26-dentsply detrey. the endodontopathic microorganisms (mo) confronted were: staphylococcus aureus (sa),  candida albicans (ca), enterococcus faecalis (ef), prevotella intermedia (pi), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). test specimens of each sealer were prepared and placed on the surface of agar plates that had been  inoculated with each mo, and after predetermined periods, transfers were made from the contact area between the test specimen and the cultured agar and from the area that had not been in contact with the test specimens (control). the results were read as presence/absence of microbial growth and analyzed statistically using the kruskal-wallis test. it was concluded that the structural features and virulence of endodontopathic microorganisms determine their response to the sealers, independently of the time during which sealers act and the mechanism by which the antiseptic reaches the microorganism, which in this case was by direct contact.

TI  == the impact of noncontact, nonthermal, low-frequency ultrasound on bacterial counts in experimental and chronic wounds.
AB  == preventing wound infection and the development of resistant bacteria are important concerns in wound management. to determine if noncontact, nonthermal, low-frequency ultrasound therapy is effective in controlling wound bacterial colony counts, a series of four related experiments was conducted. first, ultrasound penetration in both wounded and intact skin was assessed in vitro. compared to sham, noncontact ultrasound penetrated farther into both wounded (3 mm to 3.5 mm versus 0.35 mm to 0.50 mm) and intact (2.0 mm to 2.5 mm versus 0.05  mm to 0.07 mm, respectively) pig skin. second, using an in vitro model to stain and count live/dead bacteria, 0% of sham treated and 33% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 40% of escherichia coli and 27% of enterococcus faecalis were dead after one ultrasound application. minimal effects on methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and s. aureus were observed. third, using an in vivo model, after 1 week, while differences between different bacterial species were observed, overall bacterial quantity decreased with ultrasound treatment (from 7.2 +/- 0.79 to 6.7 +/- 0.91 colony forming units per gram of tissue [cfu/g]) and silver antimicrobial dressings (from 7.2 +/- 0.79 to 5.7 +/- 0.6 cfu/g) but increased to 8.6 +/- 0.15 cfu/g for sham and 8.6 +/- 0.06 cfu/g for water-moistened gauze. fourth, 11 patients (average age 60 years) with pressure ulcers containing bacterial counts >10(5) cfu/g of tissue received 2 weeks of noncontact ultrasound therapy. the quantities of seven bacterial organisms were reduced substantially from baseline to 2 weeks post treatment. none of the wounds exhibited signs of a clinical infection during the treatment period and no adverse events were observed. taken together, these four studies indicate that noncontact ultrasound can be used to reduce bacterial quantity. controlled clinical studies are warranted to ascertain the efficacy of this treatment and to further elucidate its effects on various gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == in vitro multispecies lubbock chronic wound biofilm model.
AB  == multispecies biofilms are becoming increasingly recognized as the naturally occurring state in which bacteria reside. one of the primary health issues that is now recognized to be exacerbated by biofilms are chronic, nonhealing wounds such as venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, and pressure ulcers. arguably three of the most important species associated with multispecies biofilms that our group sees clinically are pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and  staphylococcus aureus. this study was conducted to address the need for a chronic pathogenic biofilm laboratory model that allows for cooperative growth of these three organisms. we have developed a novel media formulation, simple laboratory system, quantitative polymerase chain reaction for monitoring population dynamics, and methods for objectively and subjectively measuring biofilm formation. the lubbock chronic wound pathogenic biofilm withstood treatment with  a 50-fold higher concentration of bleach than that which was completely bacteriocidal for fully turbid planktonic cultures. the lubbock chronic wound pathogenic biofilm when treated with biofilm effectors such as gallium nitrate and triclosan responded with selective inhibition of pseudomonas aeruginosa or staphylococcus aureus, respectively, as has been reported in the literature. the  ability of this 24-hour model to react as predicted using known biofilm effectors suggests that it will lend itself to future work in the development and testing of first-generation chronic wounds pathogenic biofilm therapeutics. we have defined a realistic in vitro multispecies biofilm model simulating the functional characteristics of chronic pathogenic biofilms and developed effective tools for  its characterization and analyses.

AB  == the objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (btm), as well as to clarify the  relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (btscc). the purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for btscc at the population level. samples of btm were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and streptococcus uberis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. counts of specific mammary pathogens in btm samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. significant differences were documented in btscc between btm samples containing str. agalactiae, staph. aureus, and str. dysgalactiae and btm samples that were pathogen-free. geometric means of btscc associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall btscc (str. agalactiae 243 628; staph. aureus  205 610; str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). it follows that the somatic cell count (scc) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall btscc. environmental pathogens predominated in samples of btm with scc <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in btm samples with scc >300x103/ml. no correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and btscc. this study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of btm in relation to btscc is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.

TI  == removal of radioisotopes in solution and bactericidal/bacteriostatic sterilising  power in activated carbon and metal silver filters.
AB  == activated carbon filters play an important role in water filtration and purification from contaminants of different origin. their limit consists in bacterial proliferation, which may occur only during prolonged periods of non-use and in their ability to remove radioactive contaminants present in waste water from industry or nuclear medicine departments. in this work we tested a commercially available activated carbon filter for water purification enriched with silver plated parts incubating in static condition at room temperature different micro organisms (enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, aspergillum niger), up to 78 days. the microbial growth was in general more inhibited in the presence of metal silver into the activated carbon in respect to filters with the activated carbon alone: >4log inhibition of bacterial proliferation after 78 days of incubation the presence of silver vs. 2log without silver. when the filters were  incubated empty of carbon, the sterilizing power of silver was confirmed further. the activated carbon filters proved also their ability in removing from water the principal radioisotopes used for residues liquid medical and research purposes ((131)i, (99m)tc, (201)tl, (67)ga). these results contribute useful data for the  use of the silver-enriched carbon filters in water filtration both for daily use  at home, and professional use in a nuclear medicine laboratory.

TI  == antibacterial activity of extracts of three croton species collected in mpumalanga region in south africa.
AB  == the antibacterial activities of three croton species were compared using bioautography and the serial microdilution methods. the methanolic extracts of all the species had low activity against escherichia coli. the highest activity was observed with croton megalobotrys against enterococcus faecalis with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 0.02 mg/ml. croton steenkapianus  extracts were the least active of the species investigated, only managing an mic  value of 0.625 mg/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa. croton megalobotrys leaf powder was serially extracted using solvents of various polarities. the lowest mic value (0.06 mg/ml) of the serially extracted fractions was observed with acetone against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the liquid-liquid fractions of the methanol extract of croton megalobotrys were also tested. the lowest mic value of 0.02 mg/ml was observed with n-hexane fraction against enterococcus faecalis. the carbon tetrachloride fraction was further fractionated using column chromatography with silica as the immobile phase. the resulting seven fractions were tested for activity following the bioassay-guided practice, and it emerged that the first three fractions had active compounds against staphylococcus aureus when the bioautography method was used.

TI  == the repa_n replicons of gram-positive bacteria: a family of broadly distributed but narrow host range plasmids.
AB  == the pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmids of enterococcus faecalis and the multiresistance plasmids psk1 and psk41 of staphylococcus aureus are among the best studied plasmids native to gram-positive bacteria. although these plasmids seem largely restricted to their native hosts, protein sequence comparison of their replication initiator proteins indicates that they are clearly related. homology searches indicate that these replicons are representatives of a large family of plasmids and a few phage that are widespread among the low g+c gram-positive bacteria. we propose to name this family the repa_n family of replicons after the annotated conserved domain that the initiator protein contains. detailed sequence comparisons indicate that the initiator protein phylogeny is largely congruent with that of the host, suggesting that the replicons have evolved along with their current hosts and that intergeneric transfer has been rare. however, related proteins were identified on chromosomal  regions bearing characteristics indicative of ice elements, and the phylogeny of  these proteins displayed evidence of more frequent intergeneric transfer. comparison of stability determinants associated with the repa_n replicons suggests that they have a modular evolution as has been observed in other plasmid families.

TI  == [comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin against gram-positive microorganisms: sentry surveillance program, spain (2002-2006)].
AB  == introduction and objective: daptomycin is a bactericidal lipopeptide antibiotic,  active against gram-positive bacteria. in this study, the comparative in vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against isolates recovered  in 3 spanish hospitals from 2002 to 2006 was determined as part of the international sentry antimicrobial resistance surveillance program. the possible  therapeutic role of daptomycin is addressed in the light of spanish susceptibility data. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed  by the microdilution method with 1398 consecutively recovered gram-positive isolates. results: all the staphylococci (n = 1024), enterococci (n = 228), and streptococci (n = 146) studied were susceptible to daptomycin. the highest mic values were 1, 4, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, regardless of methicillin, vancomycin, or penicillin resistance status. all staphylococcus aureus isolates were also susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. coagulase-negative staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin. only daptomycin and linezolid were active against all enterococcal isolates. in addition, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and ampicillin were fully active against enterococcus faecalis. daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, linezolid, and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active against all streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. viridans group isolates. the distribution of daptomycin mic values in s. aureus and enterococci was homogeneously sustained along the 5-year study period. conclusion: the sustained antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci in spain makes this antibiotic an excellent therapeutic option in severe infection caused by gram-positive microorganisms, including those with multiresistance.

TI  == antibacterial 5'-o-(n-dipeptidyl)-sulfamoyladenosines.
AB  == the aminoacyl-trna synthetase (aars) class of enzymes is a validated target for antimicrobial development. aminoacyl analogues of 5'-o-(n-l-aminoacyl)-sulfamoyladenosines are known to be potent inhibitors of aars, but whole cell antibacterial activity of these compounds is very limited, and poor penetration into bacteria has been proposed as the main reason for this. aiming to find derivatives that better penetrate bacteria, we developed a simple  and short method to prepare dipeptidyl-derivatives of 5'-o-(n-l-aminoacyl)-sulfamoyladenosines, and used this method to prepare 18 5'-o-(n-dipeptidyl)-sulfamoyladenosines. the antibacterial activity of these derivatives and a number of reference compounds against s. aureus, e. faecalis and e. coli was determined. several of the new derivatives showed improved antibacterial activity and an altered spectrum of antibacterial activity.

TI  == what's new and not so new on the antimicrobial horizon?
AB  == despite increasing antimicrobial resistance and multiple drug resistance in clinical isolates of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, there are few novel antimicrobial agents in development. the few new agents that have been recently licensed have tended to have narrow spectra of activity, focused on gram-positive pathogens, especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). this situation is rightly causing concern among clinicians and public health authorities worldwide. this article reviews available data on three new antibacterials currently in development. the cephalosporin ceftobiprole is active against mrsa, enterococcus faecalis and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, but otherwise has a spectrum of activity similar to that of other recent cephalosporins. in a clinical trial, ceftobiprole was non-inferior to vancomycin for the treatment of mrsa-associated complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis). doripenem, a new carbapenem, has some activity against mrsa, but otherwise has an anti-gram-positive spectrum of activity similar to that of imipenem and an anti-gram-negative spectrum similar to that of meropenem. in a clinical trial, it was non-inferior to meropenem for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections. iclaprim is a dihydrofolate  reductase inhibitor with greatly enhanced activity, as compared with trimethoprim, against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. the limited literature concerning this agent has concentrated on its potential role in the treatment of infections with gram-positive bacteria. a clinical trial has  demonstrated the non-inferiority of iclaprim, as compared with linezolid, in the  treatment of csssis, including those associated with mrsa.

TI  == compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of d-alanine, l-alanine, and valine:  application of diastereomer separation to delta15n and microbial peptidoglycan studies.
AB  == we have developed an analytical method to determine the compound-specific nitrogen isotope compositions of individual amino acid enantiomers using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. a novel derivatization of amino acid diastereomers by optically active (r)-(-)-2-butanol or (s)-(+)-2-butanol offers two advantages for nitrogen isotope analysis. first, chromatographic chiral separation can be achieved without the use of chiral stationary-phase columns. second, the elution order of these compounds on the chromatogram can be switched by a designated esterification reaction. we applied  the method to the compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of d- and l-alanine in a peptidoglycan derived from the cell walls of cultured bacteria (firmicutes and actinobacteria; enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  staphylolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and streptomyces sp.), natural whole bacterial cells (bacillus subtilis var. natto), (pseudo)-peptidoglycan from archaea (methanobacterium sp.), and cell wall from eukaryota (saccharomyces cerevisiae). we observed statistically significant differences in nitrogen isotopic compositions; e.g., delta15n ( per thousand vs air) in staphylococcus staphylolyticus for d-alanine (19.2 +/- 0.5 per thousand, n = 4) and l-alanine (21.3 +/- 0.8 per thousand, n = 4) and in bacillus subtilis for d-alanine (6.2 +/- 0.2 per thousand, n = 3) and l-alanine (8.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand, n = 3). these results suggest that enzymatic reaction  pathways, including the alanine racemase reaction, produce a nitrogen isotopic difference in amino acid enantiomers, resulting in 15n-depleted d-alanine. this method is expected to facilitate compound-specific nitrogen isotope studies of amino acid stereoisomers.

AB  == background and objective: in the treatment of bone infections, a major determinant of the clinical response is the active drug concentration at the infected site. because of the high prevalence of meticillin (methicillin)-resistant staphylococci and enterococci, glycopeptides are widely used for the treatment of bone and joint infections, but data on their penetration into human bone are lacking. the aim of our study was to measure vancomycin and teicoplanin concentrations in infected human bone under steady-state conditions and verify their relationship with inflammatory markers,  patient demographic characteristics and pharmacodynamic microbiological markers.  methods and patients: twenty-seven adult orthopaedic patients undergoing surgical debridement for septic pseudoarthrosis of the tibia and receiving either intravenous vancomycin (vancocina) 1 g twice daily) or teicoplanin (targosid) 10  mg/kg/day) were studied from january 2004 to january 2008. plasma and bone specimens were simultaneously collected during surgery for pharmacokinetic and microbiological assays at a variable interval after antimicrobial administration. bone samples were dissected into cortical and cancellous bone, cleaned of soft tissues, crushed and eluted into phosphate buffer. necrotic samples and sequestra were not analysed.plasma and bone antimicrobial concentrations were measured by a validated method of high-performance liquid chromatography with uv detection, and bone/plasma concentration ratios were calculated. cortical and cancellous bone area under the concentration-time curve (auc) over 24 hours (auc(24)) values were measured by the linear-log trapezoidal rule, using winnonlin) software, and were  compared with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the infecting agents. results: for vancomycin, the mean +/- sd concentrations were 2.66 +/- 1.2 mg/l in cortical bone and 11.53 +/- 7.8 mg/l in cancellous bone (corresponding to 20.67% and 89.39% of intraoperative plasma concentrations), and the mean +/- sd tissue auc(24) values were 55.15 +/- 25.26 h . mg/l for cortical bone and 299.16  +/- 299.54 h . mg/l for cancellous bone. for teicoplanin, the mean +/- sd concentrations were 2.01 +/- 1.7 and 7.51 +/- 7.0 mg/l in cortical and cancellous bone, respectively (12.35% and 48.6% of intraoperative plasma concentrations), and the mean +/- sd teicoplanin tissue auc(24) values were 34.08 +/- 23.6 h . mg/l and 155.17 +/- 132.8 h . mg/l for cortical bone and cancellous bone, respectively. the mean vancomycin auc(24)/mic ratios were 215.02 for plasma, 47.14 for cortical bone and 268.95 for cancellous bone. the mean teicoplanin auc(24)/mic ratios were 336.48, 36.27 and 197.21 for plasma, cortical bone and cancellous bone, respectively. conclusions: bone penetration of both glycopeptides ranged from poor (<15%) to satisfactory (15-30%) in the cortical compartment, while it was far higher into the highly vascularized cancellous tissue. vancomycin bone penetration was slightly higher than with teicoplanin, but the difference was not statistically significant. higher bone concentrations  were observed with higher inflammatory markers, possibly as a result of increased vascularization and vascular permeability under inflammatory conditions. bone concentrations over the mic and auc/mic ratios suggested that both glycopeptides  achieve a satisfactory pharmacokinetic exposure in the cancellous bone, as far as gram-positive pathogens are concerned. on the other hand, cortical bone exposure  was suboptimal in most patients. furthermore, as antimicrobial penetration may be affected by impaired blood supply, the role of radical surgical removal of purulent and necrotic tissues appears to be essential in order to shorten treatment duration and to reduce the risk of treatment failure.

TI  == ambuic acid inhibits the biosynthesis of cyclic peptide quormones in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == quorum sensing is a cell-density-dependent regulatory system in gram-positive bacteria and is often regulated by cyclic peptides called "quormones," which function as extracellular communication signals. with an aim to discover an antipathogenic agent targeting quorum sensing in gram-positive bacteria, we screened 153 samples of fungal butanol extracts with the guidance of the inhibition of quorum-sensing-mediated gelatinase production in enterococcus faecalis. following the screenings, we found that ambuic acid, a known secondary  fungal metabolite, inhibited the quorum-sensing-mediated gelatinase production without influencing the growth of e. faecalis. we further demonstrated that ambuic acid targeted the biosynthesis of a cyclic peptide quormone called gelatinase biosynthesis-activating pheromone. furthermore, ambuic acid also inhibited the biosynthesis of the cyclic peptide quormones of staphylococcus aureus and listeria innocua. these results suggest the potential use of ambuic acid as a lead compound of antipathogenic drugs that target the quorum-sensing-mediated virulence expression of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == enterococcal infections & antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == enterococci have traditionally regarded as low grade pathogens, have emerged as an increasingly important cause of nosocomial infections in the last decade. although about a dozen enterococcus species have been identified, only two are responsible for the majority of human infections, i.e., enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. the most common nosocomial infections produced by these organisms are urinary tract infections (associated with instrumentation and antimicrobial resistance), followed by intra-abdominal and pelvic infections. they also cause surgical wound infections, bacteraemia, endocarditis, neonatal sepsis and rarely  meningitis. a major reason why these organisms survive in hospital environment is the intrinsic resistance to several commonly used antibiotics and, perhaps more importantly, their ability to acquire resistance to all currently available antibiotics, either by mutation or by receipt of foreign genetic material through the transfer of plasmids and transposons. the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) is a cause of concern, as once established, it is very difficult to control. moreover, there can be transfer of resistant gene from enterococci to staphylococcus aureus thereby posing a threat to the patient safety and also challenges for the treating physicians. this review highlights the shifting spectrum of enterococcal infections, along with their geographical distribution and growing nosocomial importance. emergence of antimicrobial resistance, pathogenicity and virulence factors, current preventive, control and  treatment modalities of severe enterococcal infections are also dealt with.

TI  == streptococci and lactococci synthesize large amounts of hpr(ser-p)(his~p).
AB  == hpr is a protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (pts). in gram-positive bacteria, hpr can be phosphorylated on ser-46 by the kinase/phosphorylase hprk/p and on his-15 by phospho-enzyme i (ei~p) of the pts. in vitro studies with purified hprs from bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus salivarius have indicated that the phosphorylation of one residue impedes the phosphorylation of the other. however, a recent study showed that while the rate of streptococcus salivarius hpr phosphorylation by ei~p is reduced at acidic ph, the phosphorylation of hpr(ser-p) by ei~p, generating hpr(ser-p)(his~p), is stimulated. this suggests that hpr(ser-p)(his~p) synthesis may occur in acidogenic bacteria unable to maintain their intracellular ph near neutrality. consistent with this hypothesis, significant amounts of hpr(ser-p)(his~p) have been detected in some streptococci. the present study was  aimed at determining whether the capacity to synthesize hpr(ser-p)(his~p) is common to streptococcal species, as well as to lactococci, which are also unable  to maintain their intracellular ph near neutrality in response to a decrease in extracellular ph. our results indicated that unlike staphylococcus aureus, b. subtilis, and e. faecalis, all the streptococcal and lactococcal species tested were able to synthesize large amounts of hpr(ser-p)(his~p) during growth. we also showed that streptococcus salivarius iiablman, a protein involved in sugar transport by the pts, could be efficiently phosphorylated by hpr(ser-p)(his~p).

TI  == daptomycin in bone and joint infections: a review of the literature.
AB  == introduction: to review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety  of daptomycin, a novel antibiotic for the treatment of bone and joint infections, a literature search of relevant articles was conducted. materials and methods: a  pubmed/medline search (1990-april 2008) to identify relevant english-language literature was conducted. search terms included bone and joint infection, osteomyelitis, daptomycin, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). additional articles were identified by reviewing the bibliographies of articles cited. programs and abstracts from infectious disease meetings were searched, and prescribing information of antibiotics indicated for bone and joint infections consulted. all articles identified from data sources published in english were evaluated. results: caused primarily by gram-positive pathogens such as s. aureus and, to a lesser extent, enterococcus faecalis, bone and joint infections are difficult to treat successfully. surgical intervention and prolonged courses of antibiotics are frequently required, and failure of first-line antibiotic therapy is common. the emergence of s. aureus strains with  reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, the longstanding gold standard for bone and joint infections, has complicated the clinical scenario. few randomized trials comparing the efficacy of different antibiotics for bone and joint infections exist. daptomycin, a novel intravenous lipopeptide antibiotic, has shown potent in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria, including many resistant pathogens commonly associated with bone and joint infections such  as mrsa and vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis. early clinical investigation of daptomycin in bone and joint infections unresponsive to antibiotics, such as vancomycin, has found a cure rate of approximately 80%, with a low incidence of adverse events and drug resistance. conclusion: further studies are warranted to  determine if limited clinical evidence, described in individual case reports and  a daptomycin-specific retrospective registry, suggests daptomycin is a promising  option for patients with bone and joint infections such as mrsa osteomyelitis.

TI  == bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in ibadan, nigeria.
AB  == previous studies done on wound infections in this environment had been mostly on  the surgical variety rather than the non-surgical. however,few studies available  on the non-surgical type have indicated that changes do occur in the pattern and  antibiogram of the bacterial isolates of these non-surgical wound infections. this study was therefore designed to investigate the bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in this environment. a retrospective review of seven hundred and fifty four cases of non-surgical wound infections was conducted between september 2002 and february 2005 at the university college hospital, ibadan, nigeria. a total number of 871 bacterial, and seven fungal isolates were obtained from these wound cultures. in 477 (70.3%) cases, cultures were monomicrobial and 202 (29.8%) polymicrobial. staphylococcus aureus (38%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), klebsiella species (17%), escherichia coli (10.6%), proteus species (7.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (4.4%), streptococcus species (1.6%), enterococcus faecalis (1.4%), and candida albicans (0.8%). high rates of antibiotic resistance were recorded among these isolates. 53.4% of them  were sensitive to ceftriaxone, 42.5% to gentamycin and 39.3% to ofloxacin. this high antibiotic resistance gives credence to the value of determining the antibiogram of these pathogens in their management. continuous interaction between the wound care practitioners and microbiology department is also advocated.

TI  == role of human cd36 in bacterial recognition, phagocytosis, and pathogen-induced jnk-mediated signaling.
AB  == scavenger receptor cd36 mediates staphylococcus aureus phagocytosis and initiates tlr2/6 signaling. we analyzed the role of cd36 in the uptake and tlr-independent  signaling of various bacterium, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, s. aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. expression of human cd36 in hela cells increased the uptake of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria compared with the control mock-transfected cells. bacterial adhesion was associated with pathogen phagocytosis. upon cd36 transfection, hek293 cells, which demonstrate no tlr2/4 expression, acquired lps  responsiveness as assessed by il-8 production. the cells demonstrated a marked 5- to 15-fold increase in cytokine release upon exposure to gram-negative bacteria,  while the increase was much smaller (1.5- to 3-fold) with gram-positive bacteria  and lipoteichoic acid. cd36 down-regulation utilizing cd36 small interfering rna  reduced cytokine release by 40-50% in human fibroblasts induced by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as lps. of all mapk signaling cascade inhibitors tested, only the inhibitor of jnk, a stress-activated protein  kinase, potently blocked e. coli/lps-stimulated cytokine production. nf-kappab inhibitors were ineffective, indicating direct tlr-independent signaling. jnk activation was confirmed by western blot analyses of phosphorylated jkn1/2 products. synthetic amphipathic peptides with an alpha-helical motif were shown to be efficient inhibitors of e. coli- and lps-induced il-8 secretion as well as  jnk1/2 activation/phosphorylation in cd36-overexpressing cells. these results indicate that cd36 functions as a phagocytic receptor for a variety of bacteria and mediates signaling induced by gram-negative bacteria and lps via a jnk-mediated signaling pathway in a tlr2/4-independent manner.

TI  == reduction in infection risk through treatment of microbially contaminated surfaces with a novel, portable, saturated steam vapor disinfection system.
AB  == background: surface-mediated infectious disease transmission is a major concern in various settings, including schools, hospitals, and food-processing facilities. chemical disinfectants are frequently used to reduce contamination, but many pose significant risks to humans, surfaces, and the environment, and all must be properly applied in strict accordance with label instructions to be effective. this study set out to determine the capability of a novel chemical-free, saturated steam vapor disinfection system to kill microorganisms,  reduce surface-mediated infection risks, and serve as an alternative to chemical  disinfectants. methods: high concentrations of escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), salmonella enterica, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, ms2 coliphage (used as a surrogate for nonenveloped viruses including norovirus), candida albicans, aspergillus niger, and the endospores of clostridium difficile were dried individually onto porous clay test surfaces. surfaces were treated with the saturated steam vapor disinfection system for brief periods and then numbers of surviving microorganisms were determined. infection risks were calculated from the kill-time data using microbial dose-response relationships published in the scientific literature, accounting for surface-to-hand and hand-to-mouth transfer efficiencies. results:  a diverse assortment of pathogenic microorganisms was rapidly killed by the steam disinfection system; all of the pathogens tested were completely inactivated within 5 seconds. risks of infection from the contaminated surfaces decreased rapidly with increasing periods of treatment by the saturated steam vapor disinfection system. conclusions: the saturated steam vapor disinfection system tested for this study is chemical-free, broadly active, rapidly efficacious, and  therefore represents a novel alternative to liquid chemical disinfectants.

TI  == isolated peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases from different organisms produce different glycan chain lengths.
AB  == peptidoglycan is an essential component of bacterial cell wall. the glycan strands of peptidoglycan are synthesized by enzymes called peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (pgts). using a high-resolution sds-page assay, we compared  the glycan strand lengths of four different pgts from three different organisms (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus). we report that each enzyme makes a polymer having an intrinsic characteristic length that is independent of the enzyme:substrate ratio. the glycan strand lengths vary considerably, depending on the enzyme. these results indicate that each enzyme must have some mechanism, as yet unknown, for controlling product length. the observation that different pgts produce different length glycan chains may have implications for their cellular roles and for the three-dimensional structure of  bacterial peptidoglycan.

TI  == [infective endocarditis due to high level aminoglycoside resistant enterococcus faecalis and methicillin resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci presenting with rheumatic manifestations].
AB  == infective endocarditis has variable clinical presentations and may present with rheumatologic manifestations. infective endocarditis due to high level aminoglycoside resistant enterococci represents a severe therapeutic challenge as none of the currently recommended treatment regimens are bactericidal against these isolates. in this report, a case of infective endocarditis with double aetiology, high level aminoglycoside resistant enterococcus faecalis together with methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mr-cns), presenting  with leukocytoclastic vasculitis and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, has  been presented. a 48-years-old woman was admitted to our hospital with malaise and non-pruritic purpural rush on her lower extremities. on admission she had no  fever or leukocytosis. skin biopsy showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis and steroid therapy was started. on 12th day of admission rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis was diagnosed and she received plasmapheresis and haemodialysis support. transthoracic echocardiography (tte) demonstrated 1 x 1.5  cm vegetation on the mitral valve. an initial diagnosis of infective endocarditis was made and empirical treatment with vancomycin and gentamicin was started. all  blood cultures yielded high level aminoglycoside resistant e. faecalis and additionally two of them yielded mr-cns. vancomycin was administered in combination with high dose ampicillin and repeated blood cultures taken after administration of ampicillin, revealed no growth. the patient remained afebrile,  renal functions improved and a repeat tte done on 20th day of ampicillin therapy  showed waning of the vegetation. on 42nd day of treatment repeat tte showed new vegetation on the mitral valve and severe valve insufficiency, so the patient was scheduled for mitral valve replacement. she was treated for 12 weeks with vancomycin and ampicillin and recovered successfully. in conclusion; infective endocarditis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. physicians should document their treatment outcomes and experience with high level aminoglycoside resistant enterococcal infective endocarditis, which is a therapeutic challenge, so that the best therapeutic options can be identified.

TI  == an agar diffusion comparison of the antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide at  five different concentrations with three different vehicles.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine if varying the percent (by weight) of  aqueous calcium hydroxide or using different vehicles had an effect on its antibacterial efficacy against common endodontic pathogens in a pour plate/traditional streak agar diffusion model. mixtures of calcium hydroxide powder and sterile saline in 40, 50 and 60 percent concentrations and the commercial preparations ultracal xs and vitapex were tested against six known endodontic pathogens with an agar diffusion method. each medicament was placed in one of five wells, in each of 10 agar plates (n = 10), for cultures of each bacterial species. zones of inhibition were measured after 48 hours incubation for aerobes and 96 hours incubation for anaerobes. multiple one-way analyses of variance and post-hoc student neuman keuls evaluated the data at alpha = 0.05. larger zones of inhibition were consistently observed for higher concentrations of calcium hydroxide with statistical significance among the bacteria, particularly between 40% and 60%. vitapex had significantly smaller zones of inhibition than all other medicaments and 35% ultracal xs with methylcellulose was nearly as effective as 50% ca(oh)(2) in inhibitory activity. formulations containing 50-60% ca(oh)(2) or 35% ca(oh)(2) with aqueous methylcellulose are recommended as endodontic interappointment medicaments.

TI  == vancomycin resistance vans/vanr two-component systems.
AB  == vancomycin is a member of the glycopeptide class of antibiotics. vancomycin resistance (van) gene clusters are found in human pathogens such as enterococcus  faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus, glycopeptide-producing  actinomycetes such as amycolotopsis orientalis, actinoplanes teichomyceticus and  streptomyces toyocaensis and the nonglycopeptide producing actinomycete streptomyces coelicolor. expression of the van genes is activated by the vans/vanr two-component system in response to extracellular glycopeptide antibiotic. two major types of inducible vancomycin resistance are found in pathogenic bacteria; vana strains are resistant to vancomycin itself and also to  the lipidated glycopeptide teicoplanin, while vanb strains are resistant to vancomycin but sensitive to teicoplanin. here we discuss the enzymes the van genes encode, the range of different vans/vanr two-component systems, the biochemistry of vans/vanr, the nature of the effector ligand(s) recognised by vans and the evolution of the van cluster.

TI  == antibacterial and antioxidant activity of the secondary metabolites from in vitro cultures of the alice sundew (drosera aliciae).
AB  == the objective of the present study was to evaluate the antioxidant as well as the antibacterial properties of secondary metabolites obtained from drosera aliciae (alice sundew) plants grown in vitro and to examine the mechanism of their antimicrobial action. bactericidal activity of extracts from d. aliciae, as well  as pure ramentaceone (naphthoquinone), which is present in this plant, were examined against human pathogenic strains of micro-organisms that are both resistant and susceptible to antibiotics. a chloroform extract proved to be more  effective than a methanol preparation against all of the tested strains, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. the lowest minimal-bactericidal-concentration value was in the case of staphylococcus aureus (25-50 mg fresh weight.ml-1). the influence of d. aliciae extracts and ramentaceone on the synthesis of dna, rna or proteins in cultures of enterococcus faecalis was estimated by measurement of the incorporation of the radioactively labelled precursors [3h]thymidine, [3h]uridine or [3h]leucine respectively. the methanol extract of d. aliciae, except for a moderate effect on dna synthesis, had no influence on rna and protein synthesis. the chloroform preparation caused  about a 75% decrease in [3h]uridine incorporation in comparison with the control  after 60 min and a significant diminution in dna and protein synthesis (44 and 30% respectively). ramentaceone also decreased dna and rna synthesis, but less efficiently than did the chloroform extract, and it caused no changes in [3h]leucine incorporation. the methanol extract from d. aliciae proved to be an effective antioxidant in both the dpph (2,2-diphenyl-10-picrylhydrazyl free radical) and the frap (ferric reducing antioxidant power) assay, with the activities exceeding those of well-known antioxidants, namely the flavonoids. the chloroform extract and ramentaceone showed no antioxidative properties.

TI  == lipids including cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate contribute to the inherent antibacterial activity of human nasal fluid.
AB  == mucosal surfaces provide first-line defense against microbial invasion through their complex secretions. the antimicrobial activities of proteins in these secretions have been well delineated, but the contributions of lipids to mucosal  defense have not been defined. we found that normal human nasal fluid contains all major lipid classes (in micrograms per milliliter), as well as lipoproteins and apolipoprotein a-i. the predominant less polar lipids were myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acid, cholesterol, and cholesteryl palmitate, cholesteryl linoleate, and cholesteryl arachidonate. normal human bronchioepithelial cell secretions exhibited a similar lipid composition. removal of less-polar lipids significantly decreased the inherent antibacterial activity of nasal fluid against pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was in part restored after replenishing the lipids. furthermore, lipids extracted from nasal fluid exerted direct antibacterial activity in synergism with the antimicrobial human neutrophil peptide hnp-2 and liposomal formulations of cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate were active against p. aeruginosa at physiological concentrations as found in nasal fluid and exerted inhibitory activity against other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. these data suggest that host-derived lipids contribute to mucosal defense. the emerging concept of host-derived antimicrobial lipids unveils novel roads to a better understanding of the immunology of infectious diseases.

TI  == an in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of nine root canal sealers.
AB  == aim: the purpose of this in vitro study was to analyze the antimicrobial activity of root canal sealers by using the agar diffusion test (adt). methods and materials: three categories of root canal sealers were included in the study: resin-based sealers (4), zinc oxide-based sealers (3), and calcium hydroxide-based sealers (2). the microbial strains used were: s. aureus (2 strains), c. albicans (2 strains), and e. faecalis (1 strain). statistical analysis was conducted using a one-way analysis of variance (anova). tests of differences were analyzed using the tukey's test with a value of p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. results: the antimicrobial activity of root canal sealers was ranked in descending order as follows: sealite regular, cortisemol, dentalis kez, ah26, sealapex, acroseal/topseal, and endorez/ah plus.  conclusion: root canal sealers showed different inhibitory effects depending on their types and the bacterial strains tested. root canal sealers containing formaldehyde and eugenol proved to be effective against the microorganisms studied. clinical significance: the incorporation of antimicrobial components into root canal sealers may become an essential factor in preventing the re-growth of residual bacteria and control of bacteria re-entry into the root canal system.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial effects of topical local anesthetics.
AB  == background: the antibacterial activities of local anesthetics are recognized. objective: to investigate in vitro the activity of topical local anesthetic ointments at clinical doses. methods: the activity of two different local anesthetic ointments including lidocaine 5% and lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% was tested against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis by the disc-diffusion method. sterile discs containing topical local anesthetic drugs were prepared taking into account the doses of ointments used in clinical practice. the validity of the methodology was confirmed using topical antibacterial mupirocin. the inhibition zones of the discs were measured. results: mupirocin inhibited all the bacteria. both local anesthetic ointments were found to be most effective on e. coli, whereas they had no effects on p. aeruginosa. lidocaine 5% revealed antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, e. coli, s. pyogenes and e. faecalis, but lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5%  showed no activity on e. faecalis and inhibited s. pyogenes only at double doses. it was also observed that the antibacterial activity was in a dose-dependent manner. conclusion: in the light of these findings, it might be concluded that topical local anesthetic ointments in routine settings may have a preventive role against some bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of neuropeptides against a range of micro-organisms from skin, oral, respiratory and gastrointestinal tract sites.
AB  == many neuropeptides are similar in size, amino acid composition and charge to antimicrobial peptides. this study aimed to determine whether the neuropeptides substance p (sp), neurokinin a (nka), calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp), neuropeptide y (npy) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (vip), displayed antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. sp, npy, vip and cgrp displayed variable degrees of antimicrobial activity against all the pathogens tested with the exception of  s. aureus. these antimicrobial activities add a further dimension to the immunomodulatory roles for neuropeptides in the inflammatory and immune responses.

TI  == infective endocarditis in an urban medical center: association of individual drugs with valvular involvement.
AB  == objectives: injection drug users (idus) develop more right-sided infective endocarditis (ie) than non-idus, but it is not known whether this risk is specific to any particular injected drug. this study reviews the clinical characteristics of ie in an urban population and examines the association of drug type with manifestations of ie. methods: a retrospective cohort of 247 cases of ie was analyzed. demographic, clinical, microbiologic, and echocardiographic data were collected. results: our cohort featured a 74% idu rate, most with heroin. staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent organism. s. aureus ie was more likely to occur in idus versus non-idus (or 5.5, p<0.0001). enterococcus faecalis ie was less likely to occur in idus (or 0.21, p=0.02). tricuspid valve (tv) ie was more likely to occur in idus (or 4.37, p=0.001), while mitral valve (mv) ie occurred less commonly in idus (or 0.40, p=0.005). tv ie occurred more frequently in heroin users vs. idus not using heroin (or 4.03, p=0.033). conclusions: the epidemiology of ie in this cohort is different from that reported recently in other cohorts, likely due to the high prevalence of idu. heroin use may underlie  the association between idu and right-sided endocarditis.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as evaluated by broth microdilution and etest.
AB  == the current surveillance establishes the activity profile of tigecycline against  recent clinical u.s. isolates of target pathogens. findings from a distributed surveillance that utilized etest yielded a tigecycline activity profile that varied from that observed in a separate centralized broth microdilution (bmd) surveillance (d. c. draghi et al., poster d-0701, 46th intersci. conf. antimicrob. agents chemother., san francisco, ca). differences were noted among acinetobacter spp. and serratia marcescens and, to a lesser extent, with streptococcus pyogenes. to address whether these differences were due to discordance in testing methodology or to variations among the analyzed populations, isolates from the current surveillance were concurrently tested by bmd and etest. in all, 1,800 staphylococcus aureus, 259 s. pyogenes, 226 streptococcus pneumoniae, 93 enterococcus faecalis, 1,356 enterobacteriaceae, and 227 acinetobacter baumannii strains were evaluated. tigecycline had potent activity by bmd, with >99.6% susceptibility (%s) observed for all pathogens with  interpretive criteria, excluding enterobacter cloacae (98.3% s) and e. faecalis (86.0% s), and mic(90)s ranged from 0.03 mug/ml (s. pyogenes/s. pneumoniae) to 1  mug/ml (enterobacteriaceae/a. baumannii). similar profiles were observed by etest, with the exception of a. baumannii, although for most evaluated pathogens  etest mics trended one doubling-dilution higher than bmd mics. major or very major errors were infrequent, and a high degree of essential agreement was observed, excluding a. baumannii, s. marcescens, and s. pneumoniae, for which >/=4-fold differences in mics were observed for 29, 27.1, and 34% of the isolates, respectively. further analysis regarding the suitability of the tigecycline etest for testing s. marcescens, acinetobacter spp., and s. pneumoniae is warranted.

TI  == ceftobiprole: a review of a broad-spectrum and anti-mrsa cephalosporin.
AB  == ceftobiprole, an investigational cephalosporin, is currently in phase iii clinical development. ceftobiprole is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci, including meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and meticillin-resistant s. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, gram-negative bacilli including ampc-producing escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but excluding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. like cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime, ceftobiprole demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. in single-step and serial passage in vitro resistance development studies, ceftobiprole demonstrated a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is a weak inducer and a poor substrate for ampc beta-lactamases.ceftobiprole medocaril, the prodrug of ceftobiprole, is converted by plasma esterases to ceftobiprole in <30  minutes. peak serum concentrations of ceftobiprole observed at the end of a single 30-minute infusion were 35.5 mug/ml for a 500-mg dose and 59.6 mug/ml for  a 750-mg dose. the volume of distribution of ceftobiprole is 0.26 l/kg ( approximately 18 l), protein binding is 16%, and its serum half-life is approximately 3.5 hours. ceftobiprole is renally excreted ( approximately 70% in  the active form) and systemic clearance correlates with creatinine clearance, meaning that dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal dysfunction. ceftobiprole has a modest post-antibiotic effect (pae) of approximately 0.5 hours for mrsa and a longer pae of approximately 2 hours for penicillin-resistant pneumococci. ceftobiprole, when administered intravenously at 500 mg once every 8 hours (2-hour infusion), has a >90% probability of achieving f t(>mic) (free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]) for 40% and 60%, respectively, of the dosing interval for isolates with ceftobiprole mic < or =4 and < or =2 mg/l, respectively.currently, only limited clinical trial data are published for ceftobiprole. in a phase iii trial, 784 patients with gram-positive skin infections were randomized to treatment with either ceftobiprole 500 mg or vancomycin 1 g, each administered twice daily for 7-14 days; 93.3% of patients were clinically cured with ceftobiprole compared with 93.5% receiving vancomycin, and the eradication rate for mrsa infections was 91.8% for ceftobiprole compared  with 90% for vancomycin. a phase iii, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared ceftobiprole 500 mg every 8 hours with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours plus ceftazidime 1 g every 8 hours in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. of the 828 patients enrolled, 31% had diabetic foot infections, 30% had abscesses, and 22% had wounds. no difference in clinical cure was reported in the clinically evaluable, intent-to-treat and microbiologically evaluable populations with cure rates of 90.5%, 81.9%, and 90.8%, respectively, in the ceftobiprole-treated patients and 90.2%, 80.8%, and 90.5%, respectively, in the vancomycin plus ceftazidime-treated group. microbiologic eradication of gram-positive cocci meticillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) [ceftobiprole 91% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%] and mrsa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 80%), as well as gram-negative bacilli, e. coli (ceftobiprole 89% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%), and p. aeruginosa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 100%), was not significantly different between groups. similar cures rates in the microbiologically evaluable population occurred in both groups for panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl)-positive mssa and pvl-positive mrsa.currently, ceftobiprole has completed phase iii trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections due to mrsa and nosocomial pneumonia due to suspected or proven mrsa; phase iii trials are also ongoing in community-acquired pneumonia. ceftobiprole has so far demonstrated a good safety  profile in preliminary studies with similar tolerability to comparators. the broad-spectrum activity of ceftobiprole may allow it to be used as monotherapy in situations where a combination of antibacterials might be required. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftobiprole  and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == frequencies of resistance to melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) oil and rifampicin in staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == this study was conducted to determine the frequencies at which single-step mutants resistant to tea tree oil and rifampicin occurred amongst the gram-positive organisms staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis. for tea tree oil, resistance frequencies were very low at  <10(-9). single-step mutants resistant to tea tree oil were undetectable at two times the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) for s. aureus rn4220 and derivative mutator strains or at 3 x mic for the remaining s. aureus strains, including a clinical meticillin-resistant s. aureus isolate. similarly, no mutants were recovered at 2x mic for s. epidermidis or at 1x mic for e. faecalis. resistance frequencies determined in vitro for rifampicin (8 x mic) ranged from 10(-7) to 10(-8) for all isolates, with the exception of the s. aureus mutator strains, which had slightly higher frequencies. these data suggest that gram-positive organisms such as staphylococcus and enterococcus spp. have very low frequencies of resistance to tea tree oil.

TI  == the culture site of the gallbladder affects recovery of bacteria in symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  == aim: traditional methods for bile culturing may miss a large number of underlying bacterial infections that could lead to acute or chronic cholecystitis. aim: to evaluate possible differences regarding the site of material collection and thus  to detect the most suitable sample site for gallbladder culture. methods: a cohort of 137 patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis was enrolled. after surgical excision of the gallbladder, bile cultures were separately performed from fundus, body and neck. identification of bacteria as well as computation of  mean bacterial concentrations were performed with standard microbiological techniques. wilcoxon's paired and chi-square tests were used for comparison between continuous and discrete parameters, respectively. results: thirty-one patients (22.6%) demonstrated at least one positive culture sample. positivity was 31/31 (100.0%) in neck samples, 20/31 (64.5%) in body and 13/31 (41.9%) in fundus samples (p<0.001). the microorganisms identified were escherichia coli (14 cases) and enterococcus faecalis (10 cases), followed by staphylococcus aureus (3 cases), pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecium, enterobacter aerogenes and  enterobacter cloacae (1 case each). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the neck (272.2 +/- 187.5) were higher (p<0.01) when compared to those derived from both the body (38.2 +/- 28.7) and the fundus (12.5 +/- 11.3). mean bacterial concentrations in positive samples derived from the body were higher (p<0.01) than those derived from the fundus. conclusion: the neck of the gallbladder hosts the biggest bacterial load in comparison with the body and the fundus. this difference might be attributed to the presence of rokitansky-aschoff sinuses, which is the main histological characteristic of the  region.

TI  == attachment of ampicillin to expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene): surface reactions leading to inhibition of microbial growth.
AB  == the broad spectrum antibiotic, ampicillin (am), was reacted to expanded poly (tetrafluoroethylene) (eptfe) surfaces and resulted in the formation of antimicrobial surfaces effective against gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus thuringiensis, and enterococcus faecalis, and gram-negative, escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and salmonella enterica bacteria. these eptfe surface modifications were accomplished by utilization of microwave maleic anhydride (ma) plasma reactions leading to the formation of acid groups, followed by amidation reactions of heterofunctional nh 2/cooh-terminated polyethylene glycol (peg). the final step, the attachment of am to the peg spacer, was achieved by amidation reactions between cooh-terminated peg and nh 2 groups of am. this approach protects the cooh-am functionality and diminishes the possibility of hydrolysis of the antimicrobial active portion of am. these studies also show that approximately 90% of am molecules are still covalently attached to peg-ma-eptfe surfaces after exposure to the bacteria solutions. even after a 24 h period, the  am volume concentration changes only from 2.25 to 2.04 microg/m3, and depending upon the bacteria type, the bacteria suspensions containing am-peg-ma-eptfe specimens retain 85-99% of their initial optical density.

TI  == emergence of macrolide resistance gene mph(b) in streptococcus uberis and cooperative effects with rdmc-like gene.
AB  == streptococcus uberis ucn60 was resistant to spiramycin (mic = 8 microg/ml) but susceptible to erythromycin (mic = 0.06 microg/ml), azithromycin (mic = 0.12 microg/ml), josamycin (mic = 0.25 microg/ml), and tylosin (mic = 0.5 microg/ml).  a 2.5-kb hindiii fragment was cloned from s. uberis ucn60 dna on plasmid puc18 and introduced into escherichia coli ag100a, where it conferred resistance to spiramycin by inactivation. the sequence analysis of the fragment showed the presence of an rdmc-like gene that putatively encoded a protein belonging to the  alpha/beta hydrolase family and of the first 196 nucleotides of the mph(b) gene putatively encoding a phosphotransferase known to inactivate 14-, 15-, and 16-membered macrolides in e. coli. the entire mph(b) gene was then identified in  s. uberis ucn60. the two genes were expressed alone or in combination in e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. analysis of mics revealed that  rdmc-like alone did not confer resistance to erythromycin, tylosin, and josamycin in those three hosts. it conferred resistance to spiramycin in e. coli and e. faecalis but not in s. aureus. mph(b) conferred resistance in e. coli to erythromycin, tylosin, josamycin, and spiramycin but only low levels of resistance in e. faecalis and s. aureus to spiramycin (mic = 8 microg/ml). the combination of mph(b) and rdmc-like genes resulted in a resistance to spiramycin  and tylosin in the three hosts that significantly exceeded the mere addition of the resistance levels conferred by each resistance mechanism alone.

TI  == [influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial  susceptibility test results by the automated microbial systems].
AB  == the influence of the mixed inoculum on the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results was evaluated for the three automated microbial systems, walkaway-40 (dade microscan, west sacramento, ca, usa), vitek  2 compact (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) and raisus (nissui pharmaceutical, tokyo). in the evaluation, two different species or two different strains were mixed in serial ratios and adjusted to the inoculum cell suspension for the respective systems, and then tested for the species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. for the species-identification, all the three automated systems experienced incorrect identifications others from the species inoculated with higher likelihoods (> 90%), e.g. enterobacter cloacae plus klebsiella pneumoniae resulted in k. ornithinolytica or e. aerogenes with 93% to  97% likelihoods at the mixing ratio 9 to 1. whereas, the mixings extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing and non-producing escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant (mrsa) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant (vr) and vancomycin-susceptible (vs) enterococcus faecalis, always resulted in correct detection of a small portion of resistant cells. however, minimum ratios of resistant cells for the correct detection varied by the systems, that is, raisus required 70% of mrsa, vitek 2 compact was 8%, and the walkaway-40 was 1%. also, when the cell suspension of vs  e. faecalis spiked with proteus mirabilis was tested, the walkaway-40 reported as being very rare biotype, but both vitek 2 compact and raisus reported as the test inoculum being vr e. faecalis. with these results, it can be concluded that: first, incorrect species-identifications others from the inoculated species easily occur when the inoculum contains different species even at the ratio visibly indiscernible on the primary isolation agar plate. secondly, the automated microbial systems always intend to detect antimicrobial resistant cells in the inoculum rather than to detect major susceptible cells to prevent us from  reporting very major error interpretation.

TI  == risk factors for major infections in wegener granulomatosis: analysis of 113 patients.
AB  == objective: to characterise major infectious complications and analyse potential risk factors in patients with wegener granulomatosis (wg). methods: data from 113 patients with wg (69 male) followed at least once between january 1984 and march  2006 in our internal medicine department, were analysed retrospectively. results: a total of 35 patients (mean (sd) age at wg diagnosis: 50.2 (13.05) years) developed 53 major infections. infections were: bronchopneumonias (n = 19), herpes zoster recurrences (n = 9), cellulitis (n = 4), prostatitis (n = 4), spondylodiscitis and septic arthritis (n = 3), digestive tract infections (n = 2), enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus septicaemia (n = 2), viral hepatitis b reactivations (n = 2), post transfusion hiv infection with fatal cerebral toxoplasmosis, oesophageal candidiasis, disseminated herpes simplex and  cytomegalovirus infection, cytomegalovirus retinitis, herpetic keratitis, herpetic stomatitis, serratia sp. node suppuration and fever resolving under broad spectrum antibiotics (n = 1 each). half of the major infectious episodes occurred within 3 years after wg diagnosis. eight (7%) patients died, with two (2%) infection-related deaths. patients diagnosed with wg before 1996 had a significantly higher rate of infection than those diagnosed later (48% vs 24%, p  = 0.02). cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids were independently associated with  significantly higher risk of major infection (p<0.05 and <0.001, respectively). all patients treated since 1993 received antipneumocystosis prophylaxis. conclusion: cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids were associated with higher risk of infection. despite systematic cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, major infections, mostly bronchopneumonias and herpes zoster recurrences, were still common in the  course of wg.

TI  == method for evaluation of the efficacy of antimicrobial preservatives in cosmetic  wet wipes.
AB  == many cosmetic formulations are now available in the form of wet wipes packaged in sealed sachets or packets. like the majority of cosmetic products having an aqueous phase, wipes are susceptible to microbial contamination and require the addition of preservatives. the efficacy of such preservatives can be evaluated using a standard challenge test performed on the wetting liquid but this test cannot be regarded as representative for this new type of formulation. the method presented here evaluates the efficacy of preservatives used in wet wipes kept in  their original packaging. dried inoculums were prepared by membrane filtration followed by drying in an incubator. the method is applicable to bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis), bacillus cereus spores and fungi (candida albicans and aspergillus niger). these inoculated carriers were inserted between two wipes in the original package, which was then re-sealed immediately. the test requires one dry inoculum per packet and one packet for each control or test. after incubation at 22.5 degrees c for 1, 2, 7, 14 or 28 days and, for the control, immediately after insertion of the membrane (time 0), microorganism counts were performed on the germ-carrier membranes as well as on adjacent wipes, after transfer into a suitable neutralizing agent. the membranes were shaken in the presence of glass beads and microorganisms were dissociated from the wipes by means of a stomacher. the supernatants recovered after being left to stand for 20 min are counted by pour plate method or membrane filtration. the feasibility of the method was demonstrated for each of the seven above-mentioned strains. the repeatability and reproducibility of the results obtained is similar to that obtained for preservative efficacy tests in the pharmacopoeias. the lethal rate of microorganisms during the preparation of dry inoculums ranges from 50 to 90% depending on the strain and the test (generally, a spontaneous reduction of about 1 log up to a maximum of 2 log). the recovery rate for microorganisms from dry inoculums (on membranes) at time 0 (control = t(0)) is around 90%, regardless of  the strain or the test. the number of microorganisms recovered from the wipes (w(0)) is between 2 and 10% of the number recovered from membranes (t(0)) and may be considered negligible. application of this method to different types of wipes  demonstrates that the efficacy of preservatives, expressed as the logarithmic reduction in the number of microorganisms at each time point, depends on the type of wipe and on the strain tested. the results obtained are considerably different from those found with the standard challenge tests applied to wetting liquids for wipes. the differences found confirm the need for a specific method applicable to wipes.

TI  == detection of blastocystis from stool samples using real-time pcr.
AB  == we developed a real-time lc pcr assay to detect a 152 bp sequence in an uncharacterized region of the blastocystis genome. the described assay detected 11 of 11 atcc strains of blastocystis from subtypes 1, 3, and 4. three of three stool samples from oregon and california military personnel that were negative for blastocystis by an ova and parasite test as well as a conventional pcr assay  were positive for blastocystis using our real-time lc pcr assay. diagnosis of blastocystis infections using this sensitive method, including dna extraction and real-time pcr, only requires 3 h. the lower limit of detection for blastocystis in stool using the real-time lc pcr assay was calculated to be 760 cells of blastocystis per 100 mg of stool, an estimated 760 parasites per reaction. the assay did not cross-react with ruminococcus hansenii, anarococcus hydrogenalis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, fusobacterium prausnitzii, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, or lactobacillus acidophilus. because of the ease of use, sensitivity, specificity, and increase in blastocystis infections in the usa we believe this assay has the potential to be useful as a clinical diagnosis tool of blastocystis infection.

TI  == a functional gene array for detection of bacterial virulence elements.
AB  == emerging known and unknown pathogens create profound threats to public health. platforms for rapid detection and characterization of microbial agents are critically needed to prevent and respond to disease outbreaks. available detection technologies cannot provide broad functional information about known or novel organisms. as a step toward developing such a system, we have produced and  tested a series of high-density functional gene arrays to detect elements of virulence and antibiotic resistance mechanisms. our first generation array targets genes from escherichia coli strains k12 and cft073, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. we determined optimal probe design parameters for gene family detection and discrimination. when tested with organisms at varying phylogenetic distances from the four target strains, the array detected orthologs for the majority of targeted gene families present in bacteria belonging to the same taxonomic family. in combination with whole-genome amplification, the array  detects femtogram concentrations of purified dna, either spiked in to an aerosol  sample background, or in combinations from one or more of the four target organisms. this is the first report of a high density nimblegen microarray system targeting microbial antibiotic resistance and virulence mechanisms. by targeting  virulence gene families as well as genes unique to specific biothreat agents, these arrays will provide important data about the pathogenic potential and drug  resistance profiles of unknown organisms in environmental samples.

TI  == ceftobiprole: an extended-spectrum anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to summarize and evaluate the literature concerning ceftobiprole. data sources: literature identification was conducted through medline (1966-february 2008) and international pharmaceutical abstracts (1970-february 2008) using the terms ceftobiprole, medocaril, bal 5788, ro-5788, bal 9141, ro 63-9141, pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, mrsa, complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssis), community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia. additional publications were identified through a review of articles and abstracts from infectious disease meetings. study selection and data extraction: all articles in english were evaluated and all pertinent information was included. data synthesis: ceftobiprole medocaril is an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, enterobacteriaceae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. inactivity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecium. preliminary data suggest that ceftobiprole may be effective with a 1-hour infusion of 500 mg every 12 hours for gram-positive infections and 500 mg every 8 hours with a 2-hour infusion for polymicrobial infections. two clinical trials support these dosing regimens for csssis. ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin in suspected gram-positive csssis, with cure rates of 93.3% and 93.5%, respectively. furthermore, ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin and ceftazidime in polymicrobial csssis (cure rates 90.5% vs 90.2%, respectively). although the total number of adverse effects was similar to those of the comparator, more patients in the ceftobiprole group experienced nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia. conclusions: the  activity of ceftobiprole and limited clinical data suggest that it may be useful  as empiric monotherapy for csssi and in combination with other antimicrobials in  lower respiratory tract infections for which phase 3 clinical trials are currently exploring. although not shown in vitro, ceftobiprole may induce resistance due to its broad spectrum of activity. approval is expected for the treatment of csssi.

TI  == characteristics of an environmental strain, enterococcus faecalis cect7121, and its effects as additive on craft dry-fermented sausages.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria are the most adequate microorganisms for natural preservation of food. in the present work, the strain of enterococcus faecalis cect7121 was employed in the manufacture of craft dry-fermented sausages and its  performance as a biopreservative was analysed. this strain is devoid of the genes for haemolysin and gelatinase and does not produce biogenic amines. it is sensitive to almost all the antibiotics tested and opsonophagocytic assays showed that it is devoid of a capsule. this strain had a high ld50 (10(11)cfu ml(-1)) in mice. no statistical differences were found between control and sausages inoculated with e. faecalis cect7121 regarding the production of lactic acid, ph  variation over time, reaching a minimum ph value of 5.1, and sensory analysis in  both series. sausages inoculated with e. faecalis cect7121 had lower viable counts of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus and other gram-positive cocci at the end of fermentation and 7 days and no viable enterobacteria and s. aureus  were recovered at the end of drying. e. faecalis cect7121 did not affect the growth of lactobacillus spp. but it displaced the autochthonous populations of enterococci. e. faecalis cect7121 was recovered in each time point as assessed by its inhibitory activity on listeria monocytogenes and s. aureus. these results would indicate that the addition of e. faecalis cect7121 during the manufacture of craft dry-fermented sausages offers an interesting alternative for biopreservation.

TI  == the antimicrobial and antifungal efficacy of tetracycline-integrated gutta-percha.
AB  == the purpose of this study was in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial and antifungal efficacy of commercially available gutta-percha containing tetracycline on some potential endodontic pathogens. the test microorganisms were enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, porphyromonas endodontalis, and candida albicans . tetracycline-integrated gutta-percha (tgp) cones, tetracycline disc, and conventional gutta-percha cones  of the same size were placed on the inoculated plates. the plates were incubated  at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically. growth inhibition zones on each plate were inspected at 24, 48, and 72 h. tetracycline disc and tgp cones inhibited all the tested bacterial strains, however the greatest antimicrobial effect was seen on s. aureus. tetracycline disc and tgp seemed less effective on  e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa. however, all tested treatments were unable to affect c. albicans . based on the results of this study, it seems that tgp offers an antimicrobial advantage over conventional gutta-percha.

TI  == healthcare-associated infections in finnish acute care hospitals: a national prevalence survey, 2005.
AB  == the objectives of the first national prevalence survey on healthcare-associated infections (hais) in finland were to assess the extent of hai, distribution of hai types, causative organisms, prevalence of predisposing factors and use of antimicrobial agents. the voluntary survey was performed during february-march 2005 in 30 hospitals, including tertiary and secondary care hospitals and 10 (25%) other acute care hospitals in the country. the overall prevalence of hai was 8.5% (703/8234). surgical site infection was the most common hai (29%), followed by urinary tract infection (19%) and primary bloodstream infection or clinical sepsis (17%). hai prevalence was higher in males, among intensive care and surgical patients, and increased with age and severity of underlying illness. the most common causative organisms, identified in 56% (398/703) of patients with hais, were escherichia coli (13%), staphylococcus aureus (10%) and enterococcus faecalis (9%). hais caused by multi-resistant microbes were rare (n = 6). a total of 122 patients were treated in contact isolation due to the carriage of multi-resistant microbes. at the time of the survey, 19% of patients had a urinary catheter, 6% central venous line and 1% were ventilated. antimicrobial treatment was given to 39% of patients. these results can be used for prioritising infection control measures and planning more detailed incidence surveillance of hai. the survey was a useful tool to increase the awareness of hai in participating hospitals and to train infection control staff in diagnosing hais.

TI  == frequency and expression of mutacin biosynthesis genes in isolates of streptococcus mutans with different mutacin-producing phenotypes.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the frequency and expression of biosynthesis genes in 47 streptococcus mutans isolates with different mutacin-producing phenotypes. detection of the frequency and expression of genes encoding mutacin types i, ii, iii and iv were carried out by pcr and semi-quantitative rt-pcr, respectively, using primers specific for each type of biosynthesis gene. in addition, a further eight genes encoding putative bacteriocins, designated bsm 283, bsm 299, bsm 423, bsm 1889c, bsm 1892c, bsm 1896, bsm 1906c and bsm 1914, were also screened. there was a high phenotypic diversity; some streptococcus mutans isolates presented broad antimicrobial spectra against other streptococcus mutans clinical isolates, including bacteria resistant to common antibiotics, as  well as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis  and streptococcus pyogenes. the expression frequency of the bsm gene was higher than that of the previously characterized mutacins (i-iv). there was no positive  correlation between the number of indicator strains inhibited (antimicrobial spectra) and the number of biosynthesis genes expressed (spearman correlation test, r=-0.03, p>0.05). in conclusion, the high diversity of mutacin-producing phenotypes, associated with high frequency of expression of the biosynthesis genes screened, reveals a broad repertoire of genetic determinants encoding antimicrobial peptides that can act in different combinations.

TI  == multiplex polymerase chain reaction detection enhancement of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  == objective: to test a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method for simultaneous detection of multiple organisms in bloodstream infections. methods: prospective observational study at the university of california davis medical center (sacramento, ca). two hundred adult (>18 yrs) patients from the emergency room, intensive care units, and general medicine wards at risk of a bloodstream infection and who manifested signs of systemic inflammatory response  syndrome (sirs). whole blood samples for pcr testing were collected at the same time as blood culture (bc). pcr results were compared to blood and other culture  results. results: pcr detected potentially significant bacteria and fungi in 45 cases compared to 37 by bc. pcr detected the methicillin resistance (meca) gene in all three culture-confirmed methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cases. more than 68% of pcr results were confirmed by blood, urine, and catheter culture. independent clinical arbitrators could not rule out the potential clinical significance of organism(s) detected by pcr, but not by bc. pcr did not  detect enterococcus faecalis in five bc-confirmed cases. on average, seven patient samples could be tested simultaneously with the pcr method in 6.54 +/- .27 hrs. conclusions: multiplex pcr detected potentially significant bacteria and fungi that were not found by bc. bc found organisms that were not detected by pcr. despite limitations of both bc and pcr methods, pcr could serve as an adjunct to current culture methods to facilitate early detection of bloodstream infections. early detection of microorganisms has the potential to facilitate evidence-based treatment decisions, antimicrobial selection, and adequacy of antimicrobial therapy.

AB  == extracts of cultures grown in liquid or on solid rice media of the fungal endophyte ampelomyces sp. isolated from the medicinal plant urospermum picroides  exhibited considerable cytotoxic activity when tested in vitro against l5178y cells. chromatographic separation yielded 14 natural products that were unequivocally identified based on their 1h and 13c nmr as well as mass spectra and comparison with previously published data. six compounds (2, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 11) were natural products. both fungal extracts differed considerably in their secondary metabolites. the extract obtained from liquid cultures afforded a pyrone (2) and sulfated anthraquinones (7 and 9) along with the known compounds 1, 3, 6 and 8. when grown on solid rice medium the fungus yielded three compounds 4, 5 and 11 in addition to several known metabolites including 6, 8, 10, 12, 13 and 14. compounds 4, 8 and 10 showed the strongest cytotoxic activity against l5178y cells with ec50 values ranging from 0.2-7.3microg/ml. furthermore, 8 and 10 displayed antimicrobial activity against the gram-positive pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis at minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 12.5microg/ml and 12.5-25microg/ml, respectively. interestingly, 6 and 8 were also identified as constituents of an extract derived from a healthy plant sample of the host plant u. picroides thereby indicating that the production of bioactive natural products by the endophyte proceeds also under in situ conditions within the host plant.

TI  == interactions of some common pathogenic bacteria with acanthamoeba polyphaga.
AB  == protozoan grazing is a major trophic pathway whereby the biomass re-enters the food web. nonetheless, not all bacteria are digested by protozoa and the number known to evade digestion, resulting in their environmental augmentation, is increasing. we investigated the interactions of bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), with the amoeba, acanthamoeba polyphaga. there was evidence of predation of all bacterial species except l. monocytogenes and s. aureus, where extracellular numbers were significantly higher when cultured with amoebae compared with growth in the absence of amoebae. intracellular growth kinetic experiments and fluorescent confocal microscopy suggest that s. aureus survived and may even multiply within a. polyphaga, whereas there was no apparent intra-amoebal replication of l. monocytogenes and higher numbers were likely sustained on metabolic waste products released during coculture.

TI  == the role of bacteria in lactational mastitis and some considerations of the use of antibiotic treatment.
AB  == background: the role of bacterial pathogens in lactational mastitis remains unclear. the objective of this study was to compare bacterial species in breast milk of women with mastitis and of healthy breast milk donors and to evaluate the use of antibiotic therapy, the symptoms of mastitis, number of health care contacts, occurrence of breast abscess, damaged nipples and recurrent symptoms in relation to bacterial counts. methods: in this descriptive study, breast milk from 192 women with mastitis (referred to as cases) and 466 breast milk donors (referred to as controls) was examined bacteriologically and compared using analytical statistics. statistical analyses were also carried out to test for relationships between bacteriological content and clinical symptoms as measured on scales, prescription of antibiotics, the number of care contacts, occurrence of breast abscess and recurring symptoms. results: five main bacterial species were found in both cases and controls: coagulase negative staphylococci (cns), viridans streptococci, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), group b streptococci (gbs) and enterococcus faecalis. more women with mastitis had s. aureus and gbs in their breast milk than those without symptoms, although 31% of healthy women harboured s. aureus and 10% had gbs. there were no significant correlations between bacterial counts and the symptoms of mastitis as measured on scales. there were no differences in bacterial counts between those prescribed and not prescribed antibiotics or those with and without breast abscess. gbs in breast milk was associated with increased health care contacts (p = 0.02). women with >/= 10(7) cfu/l cns or viridans streptococci in their breast milk had increased odds for damaged nipples (p = 0.003). conclusion: many healthy breastfeeding women have potentially pathogenic bacteria in their breast milk. increasing bacterial counts did not affect the clinical manifestation of mastitis; thus bacterial counts in breast milk may be of limited value in the decision to treat  with antibiotics as results from bacterial culture of breast milk may be difficult to interpret. these results suggest that the division of mastitis into  infective or non-infective forms may not be practically feasible. daily follow-up to measure the subsidence of symptoms can help detect those in need of antibiotics.

AB  == from 1911 outpatients, who addressed a timisoara private clinical laboratory, from january to december 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. sensitivity testing to  antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion kirby-bauer method and the automatic analyzer osiris, also. the main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by enterobacteriaceae, head of the  list being escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and proteus mirabilis (3.02%). we also isolated gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), streptococcus agalactiae, and also gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). as soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them  in resistance phenotypes: most of the enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. an e. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). as for staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a k (nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase  only. antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians,  healthcare managers, and policymakers. the use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (2005-2006).
AB  == ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssis) and nosocomial pneumonia. this agent is also active against other prominent gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for  broad-spectrum therapy. we evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested  against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in north america, latin america, and europe). all isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and  < or =8 microg/ml, respectively, although mic90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. ceftobiprole was also broadly active against streptococcus pneumoniae,  beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at <  or =0.5 microg/ml. although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against enterococcus faecium, the majority of enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were  inhibited at < or =4 microg/ml. this agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (mic50 values, < or =0.06 microg/ml) for all tested enterobacteriaceae. although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/ml versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against  enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (mic50, 2 microg/ml) and 2-fold  more potent than cefepime. none of these agents inhibited >45% of acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/ml. ceftobiprole is a new anti-mrsa beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. these characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for csssis, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where mrsa and p. aeruginosa  may be prevalent.

TI  == update on the appropriate use of linezolid in clinical practice.
AB  == multi-antibiotic resistant gram-positive cocci, which include staphylococcus aureus, the coagulase-negative staphylococcal group, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and other streptococci, represent emerging pathogens especially in the setting of the immunocompromised, hospitalized patients, in particular when surgery, invasive procedures, or prosthetic implants are of concern, patients are admitted in intensive care units, or underlying chronic disorders and immunodeficiency are of concern, and broad-spectrum antibiotics or  immunosuppressive drugs are widely administered. during the recent years, the phenomenon of multiresistant gram-positive cocci is spreading to the community, where the retrieval of such microorganism is progressively increasing. the spectrum of available antimicrobial compounds for an effective management of these relevant infections is significantly impaired in selection and clinical efficacy by the emerging and spread of methicillin-resistant and more recently glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive microbial strains. the first oxazolidinone derivative linezolid, together with the recently licensed quinupristin-dalfopristin, daptomycin, and tigecycline, followed by a number of glycopeptides, fluoroquinolones, and other experimental compounds on the pipeline, represent an effective response to the great majority of these concerns, due to their innovative mechanisms of action, their maintained or enhanced activity against multiresistant pathogens, their effective pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties, their frequent possibility of synergistic activity with other compounds effective against gram-positive pathogens, and a diffuse potential for a safe and easy administration, also when  compromised patients are of concern. the main problems related to the epidemiological and clinical features of multiresistant gram-positive infection,  the potential clinical indications of all recently available compounds compared with the standard of care of treatment of resistant gram-positive infections, and updated data on efficacy and tolerability of linezolid as the golden standard compound for vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci in multiple clinical situations, are outlined and updated on the ground of an extensive review of all  the available, recent evidences coming from the international literature.

TI  == pediatric endocarditis and stroke: a single-center retrospective review of seven  cases.
AB  == the acute management of strokes in children with infective endocarditis is limited by the paucity of published data on their clinical course and outcomes. our retrospective study at an urban tertiary-care academic center characterized the clinical course of seven pediatric patients with endocarditis and subsequent  cerebral infarcts. among 115 patients with endocarditis, a stroke occurred in seven. four patients manifested congenital heart disease. in six patients, the stroke occurred in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery, with no preference for the left or right hemisphere. the most common presenting sign was  focal weakness. three patients manifested mycotic aneurysms, all of which were successfully repaired. two patients received aspirin therapy, with no adverse effects. all patients survived, but neurologic recovery was variable. the two youngest patients (aged 3 and 14 weeks) demonstrated the longest periods of hospitalization, with the most severe neurologic impairment. these findings suggest that children may have better outcomes than adults after a stroke secondary to bacterial endocarditis. routine surveillance for mycotic aneurysms in patients with new neurologic deficits, and the use of aspirin, should be considered in the medical management.

TI  == effect of lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus lactis and enterococcus faecalis on the behaviour of staphylococcus aureus in microfiltered milk.
AB  == the effect of four strains of lactococcus garvieae, three strains of lactococcus  lactis and one strain of enterococcus faecalis on staphylococcus aureus sa15 growth in microfiltered milk was evaluated. lactococcus and enterococcus strains  were co-cultured with s. aureus in microfiltered milk and in medium buffered at ph 6.8. all lactococcus and enterococcus strains were able to inhibit s. aureus growth after 6h of incubation. inhibition by l. lactis and e. faecalis strains could be partially attributed to the decrease in ph below 6.0 as it has been observed in medium buffered at ph 6.8. l. garvieae strains were the most effective to inhibit s. aureus growth without acidification. inhibition of s. aureus could not be attributed neither to production of lactate, acetate or nor to antistaphylococcal substance. amino acids competition was not involved in the  inhibition by l. garvieae as addition of valine, isoleucine, threonine, methionine and phenylalanine did not suppress the inhibition of s. aureus.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine by two different  tests.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial capacity of sodium hypochlorite (1% and 5%) and chlorhexidine (0.12%, 0.5% and 1%) with or without the addition of organic material (bovine serum albumin, bsa) against some bacterial samples (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum) using two activity tests (contact and diffusion agar tests). in the contact test (first model), bacterial samples were kept in contact with each irrigating solution for different time intervals: immediately (t(0)), 5 min (t(5)), 15 min (t(15)) and 30 min (t(30)). the agar diffusion test was the second model used. in half the specimens, 0.5% bsa was added to simulate organic tissue present in the root canal. bacterial growth was evaluated for each microorganism and activity test. each test was repeated 10 times. in the contact test, 0.12% chlorhexidine solution (chx) did not eliminate e. faecalis at any tested time. chx at 0.5% eliminated all strains except e. faecalis after immediate contact. all strains were eliminated by 1% chx, 1% naocl and 5% naocl. bsa did not interfere with the  antimicrobial activity of the irrigating solutions. in the agar diffusion test, all solutions exhibited zones of antimicrobial activity; however, bsa interfered  with the antimicrobial activity of naocl and chx. under the condition of the contact test, the 0.12% chx was ineffective in eliminating e. faecalis, while 0.5% chx, 1% chx, 1% naocl and 5% naocl showed antibacterial effectiveness against all the tested bacterial strains. the addition of an organic load interfered with the accuracy of the agar diffusion test.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of omiganan pentahydrochloride tested against contemporary bacterial pathogens commonly responsible for catheter-associated infections.
AB  == objectives: omiganan pentahydrochloride is a cidal cationic peptide with a broad  antimicrobial spectrum, including yeast, currently in development as a topical agent for the prevention of catheter-associated infections. we evaluated the spectrum and potency of omiganan against pathogens commonly associated with such  infections. methods: a recent (2005-06) collection of bacterial isolates originating from patients with bloodstream, respiratory tract, and skin and skin  structure infections in us medical centres was evaluated by reference broth microdilution methods against omiganan and comparator agents. results: all tested gram-positive (390) and -negative (167) isolates were inhibited by < or = 128 and < or = 1024 mg/l, respectively, of omiganan. the agent was the most active against coagulase-negative staphylococci (range 1-8 mg/l; mic(50/90), 4 mg/l) and inhibited all staphylococcus aureus at < or = 32 mg/l (mic(50/90), 16 mg/l). omiganan was 16-fold more active against enterococcus faecium than enterococcus faecalis (mic(50/90) results, 4/8 versus 64/128 mg/l, respectively). mic ranges and mic(50) potencies were unaffected by methicillin resistance in staphylococci, vancomycin resistance in enterococci, and penicillin resistance in streptococci.  omiganan potency was also unaffected by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in escherichia coli when compared with wild-type strains (mic(50) values 32 mg/l), although a 4-fold increase was noted among esbl-positive klebsiella spp. (128 versus 32 mg/l, respectively). wild-type enterobacter spp. displayed higher omiganan mic(50/90) results (64/512 mg/l) compared with ampc-hyperproducing strains (32/64 mg/l). carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant p. aeruginosa strains exhibited omiganan mic(50/90) values of 128/256 mg/l. conclusions: at a 1% (10 000 mg/l) topical gel formulation, omiganan can be expected to inhibit all clinically relevant bacterial species producing catheter-associated infections (all mic values, < or = 1024 mg/l), including those with antimicrobial-resistant phenotypes.

TI  == placental histological inflammation and reproductive tract infections in a low risk pregnant population in latvia.
AB  == background: to investigate the correlation of reproductive tract infections (rti) and endogenous vaginal flora at first antenatal consultation with placental histological inflammation. methods: in a follow-up study, 154 low risk women with no miscarriage risk factors were examined for the presence of neisseria gonorrhoeae, trichomonas vaginalis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus agalactiae  (gbs), staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis (gds) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). at delivery, outcome data were collected and the histology of the placenta  was studied. results: some 85 (56.3%) of all pregnant women had rti or endogenous vaginal flora. placental histological inflammation correlated with genital tract  colonisation with g. vaginalis (p =0.013), bv (p =0.031), s. aureus (p =0.04) and aerobic vaginitis (p =0.017). bv and bv-related g. vaginalis correlated with the  presence of parietal and placental chorioamnionitis in 53.8 and 43.5% of cases. genital tract colonisation with gds and other aerobic flora in combination with inflammatory vaginitis correlated with the presence of funisitis in 33.3 and 40.0% of cases. mycoplasmas increased the risk for intrauterine infection only when present in combination with other rtis (p =0.023). conclusion: histological  placental inflammation is associated with both bv and genital tract colonisation  with aerobic bacteria, while funisitis is associated with colonisation of aerobic bacteria at first prenatal visit before the 17th gestational week.

TI  == linezolid in children: recent patents and advances.
AB  == linezolid is the first approved member of a new generation of antibiotics, the synthetic oxazolidinones, to become available, with a broad spectrum of in vitro  activity against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium. it has an excellent bioavailability both intravenously and orally and a very good safety profile both in adults and in children. with regards to its antimicrobial action, linezolid has a predominantly bacteriostatic action, rather than a bacteriocidal effect and is active against gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. linezolid is currently showing great promise for the treatment of multi-resistant gram-positive infections, both in the community and in a hospital setting. clinical indications so far include skin and soft tissue infections, community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia due to mrsa, vre bacteremia and community-acquired pneumonia due to penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. we anticipate that this new generation of antimicrobial agents will provide adequate cover in the future for infections that cause significant treatment failures so far, such as vre- associated endocarditis, bone and joint multi-drug resistant infections and possibly central nervous system infections, both in adult and children populations. some patents on linezolid are also discussed in this review.

TI  == succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a pcr-based approach.
AB  == the goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using  pcr. in a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, pcr enabled detection of leuconostoc and lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. subsequently, lactobacillus and pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. pcr also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin a producers and accounted for the lab succession in the  fermenting samples. a total of 328 lab isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which pcr could identify an overwhelming 186 lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 pediococcus and 29 leuconostoc isolates, respectively. based on antimicrobial assay against target strain leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b640, 28% of the lab were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin a and mesentericin producers. the bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of gram-positive target lab strains and pathogenic bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == triclosan-loaded poloxamine micelles for enhanced topical antibacterial activity  against biofilm.
AB  == our research group is interested in the study of different technological approaches to treat hospital biofilm as a means to constrain nosocomial-acquired  infections. the present work investigated the effect of the incorporation of the  antibacterial agent triclosan (ts) into polymeric micelles of poloxamine t1107 (mw=15 kda, 70 wt% peo). the aggregation phenomenon was primarily investigated by means of critical micellar concentration in a broad range of ph. then, the effect of the polymer concentration on the micellar size was evaluated by dynamic light  scattering. solubility levels increased up to 4 orders of magnitude. the drug inclusion affected the micellization, resulting in size increase and micellar fusion. this phenomenon was only apparent in ts-saturated systems. ts-loaded aggregates proved to be active in vitro against a broad spectrum of bacteria but  more importantly, also against two representative clinical pathogens: methicilin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vref). while the former was sensitive to even very low ts  levels attainable in poloxamine-free aqueous media, the later was inhibited only  when exposed to higher drug levels affordable exclusively using an inclusion system. these findings indicated the release of the drug from the reservoir. finally, the activity of a ts-containing 5% poloxamine combination of ph 7.4 was  assessed on biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis. results showed a significant  decrease (p<0.001) in the number of colony-formation units when the biofilm was exposed to the ts/poloxamine as compared to the limited activity of the polymer-free ts control.

TI  == a staphylococcus aureus regulatory system that responds to host heme and modulates virulence.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus, a bacterium responsible for tremendous morbidity and mortality, exists as a harmless commensal in approximately 25% of humans. identifying the molecular machinery activated upon infection is central to understanding staphylococcal pathogenesis. we describe the heme sensor system (hssrs) that responds to heme exposure and activates expression of the heme-regulated transporter (hrtab). inactivation of the hss or hrt systems leads  to increased virulence in a vertebrate infection model, a phenotype that is associated with an inhibited innate immune response. we suggest that the coordinated activity of hss and hrt allows s. aureus to sense internal host tissues, resulting in tempered virulence to avoid excessive host tissue damage. further, genomic analyses have identified orthologous hss and hrt systems in bacillus anthracis, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis, suggesting a conserved regulatory system by which gram-positive pathogens sense heme as a molecular marker of internal host tissue and modulate virulence.

TI  == reduction of bacteria on spinach, lettuce, and surfaces in food service areas using neutral electrolyzed oxidizing water.
AB  == food safety issues and increases in food borne illnesses have promulgated the development of new sanitation methods to eliminate pathogenic organisms on foods  and surfaces in food service areas. electrolyzed oxidizing water (eo water) shows promise as an environmentally friendly broad spectrum microbial decontamination agent. eo water is generated by the passage of a dilute salt solution ( approximately 1% nacl) through an electrochemical cell. this electrolytic process converts chloride ions and water molecules into chlorine oxidants (cl(2), hocl/clo(-)). at a near-neutral ph (ph 6.3-6.5), the predominant chemical species is the highly biocidal hypochlorous acid species (hocl) with the oxidation reduction potential (orp) of the solution ranging from 800 to 900mv. the biocidal activity of near-neutral eo water was evaluated at 25 degrees c using pure cultures of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis. treatment of these organisms,  in pure culture, with eo water at concentrations of 20, 50, 100, and 120ppm total residual chlorine (trc) and 10min of contact time resulted in 100% inactivation of all five organisms (reduction of 6.1-6.7log(10)cfu/ml). spray treatment of surfaces in food service areas with eo water containing 278-310ppm trc (ph 6.38)  resulted in a 79-100% reduction of microbial growth. dip (10min) treatment of spinach at 100 and 120ppm trc resulted in a 4.0-5.0log(10)cfu/ml reduction of bacterial counts for all organisms tested. dipping (10min) of lettuce at 100 and  120ppm trc reduced bacterial counts of e. coli by 0.24-0.25log(10)cfu/ml and reduced all other organisms by 2.43-3.81log(10)cfu/ml.

TI  == antimicrobial lexitropsins containing amide, amidine, and alkene linking groups.
AB  == the synthesis and properties of 80 short minor groove binders related to distamycin and the thiazotropsins are described. the design of the compounds was  principally predicated upon increased affinity arising from hydrophobic interactions between minor groove binders and dna. the introduction of hydrophobic aromatic head groups, including quinolyl and benzoyl derivatives, and of alkenes as linkers led to several strongly active antibacterial compounds with mic for staphylococcus aureus, both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains, in the range of 0.1-5 microg ml-1, which is comparable to many established antibacterial agents. antifungal activity was also found in the range of 20-50 microg ml-1 mic against aspergillus niger and candida albicans, again comparable  with established antifungal drugs. a quinoline derivative was found to protect mice against s. aureus infection for a period of up to six days after a single intraperitoneal dose of 40 mg kg-1.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of rwj-54428 against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model.
AB  == rwj-54428 (also known as mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with promising activity against gram-positive bacteria. the pharmacodynamics (pds) of rwj-54428  against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis were studied in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model. the rwj-54428 mics ranged from 0.25 to 1 mg/liter. mice with ca. 10(6) cfu/thigh at the initiation of therapy were treated intraperitoneally with rwj-54428 at doses that ranged from 3 to 1,200 mg/kg of body weight/day (in 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 divided doses) for 24 h. the maximal reductions in bacterial counts in thigh tissues at 24 h for the methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, and e. faecalis strains were -2.8, -3.8, and -1.7 log10 cfu/thigh, respectively.  the percentage of a 24-h dosing interval that the unbound serum rwj-54428 concentrations exceeded the mic (ft>mic) was the pharmacokinetic (pk)-pd parameter that best described the efficacy of rwj-54428. the ft>mics for a bacteriostatic effect (no net change in the numbers of cfu/thigh over 24 h) ranged from 14 to 20% for staphylococci and streptococci; for maximal reductions  in the numbers of cfu/thigh, the ft>mics ranged from 22 to 36% for these strains. for e. faecalis, the ranges of ft>mics for static and maximal effects were 30 to  46% and 55 to 60%, respectively. these data show that treatment with rwj-54428 results in marked antibacterial effects in vivo, with the pk-pd parameters for efficacy being comparable to those for the efficacy of penicillins and carbapenems active against staphylococci and pneumococci.

TI  == postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections: an unsolved problem in  thoracic surgery.
AB  == background: antibiotics currently recommended for prophylaxis in thoracic surgery are first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins. despite this prophylaxis, postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections remains frequent and severe. however, in the medical literature, the origin of these infections is poorly documented. methods: to evaluate the efficiency of current prophylactic regimens, we retrospectively analyzed 312 consecutive cases of major pulmonary resection, performed between january 2000 and december 2004. for patients who experienced postoperative pulmonary infection, the microbiologic agents and their antibiotic susceptibility were studied. results: a postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed in 76 patients (24.4% +/- 0.43%). sixty patients (78.9%)  experienced the infection in the first 5 postoperative days. a microbiologic documentation was obtained in 44 cases (57.9%) with 56 microorganisms involved. pathogens responsible for the infections were staphylococcus aureus (n = 10), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 8), group b streptococcus organisms (n = 1), nongroupable streptococcus organisms (n = 2), enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), haemophilus spp. (n = 9), branhamella catarrhalis (n = 2), enterobacteriaceae (n  = 15), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), and candida spp. (n = 4). according to the antibiotic susceptibility testings, the prophylactic regimen by cefazolin proved ineffective for 84% of the microbiologically documented cases. conclusions: this study confirmed the inefficiency of current prophylaxis against pathogens involved in postoperative pneumonia after major lung resections. evaluation of new and more-adapted approaches of antibiotic prophylaxis should be the subject of prospective multicenter trials.

TI  == pretreatment with the protegrin ib-367 affects gram-positive biofilm and enhances the therapeutic efficacy of linezolid in animal models of central venous catheter infection.
AB  == background: biofilms play an important role in the pathogenesis of several chronic infections and nosocomial infections related to indwelling medical devices. methods: to assess the efficacy of ib-367 and linezolid (lzd) in the treatment of central venous catheter (cvc) infections using the antibiotic-lock technique, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed. the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility assay for staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis biofilms developed on 96-well polystyrene tissue culture plates was performed to determine the activity of the compounds. efficacy studies were performed in rat models of gram-positive cvc infection. silastic catheters were implanted into the superior  cava of adult male wistar rats. twenty-four hours after implantation, the catheters were pretreated by filling with ib-367. thirty minutes later, rats were challenged via the cvc with 1.0 x 10(6) cfu (colony forming units) of s aureus strain diffuse smith and clinical isolate of slime-producing e faecalis. administration of lzd into the cvc at a concentration equal to the minimum bacteriocidal concentration observed using adherent cells or at a much higher concentration (1024 microg/ml) began 24 hours later. results: both for s aureus and e faecalis, the killing activities of lzd against adherent bacteria were at least 4-fold to 8-fold lower than that against freely growing cells. for both strains, in ib-367-pretreated wells, lzd strongly increases its activity. the in  vivo studies showed that when cvcs were pretreated with ib-367, gram-positive biofilm bacterial load was further decreased to 10(1) cfu/ml and bacteremia was not detected. conclusions: ib-367 has potential as an adjunctive agent to lzd in  the treatment of gram-positive biofilm infections such as cvc infections.

TI  == bactericidal activity of extended 9-glycyl-amido-minocyclines.
AB  == the need for self-protecting polymer or alloy implants resistant to a broad spectrum of bacterial challenges led us to investigate covalent bonding of minocycline (min), a tetracycline derivative, to polystyrene beads and to titanium alloy foils by oligoethylene glycol spacers. 9-hydrazino-acetyl-amido-min, and simpler glycylcycline derivatives, retained minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) against staphylococcus aureus comparable to min. however, peg-glycyl-amido-min showed very low activity. hence, we coupled 9-hydrazino-acetyl-amido-min to the aldehyde termini of oligoethylene glycol spacers bonded to polystyrene and titanium alloy surfaces to form acid-releasable hydrazone linkages. 9-hydrazino-acetyl-amido-min was released from the monolayers more rapidly at ph 5.0 than at ph 7.4.

TI  == preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  == the aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. one hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. on the basis of these results,  80% alcohol, octenidine 0.1%, and chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro  model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans. the microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. the results of  the questionnaire revealed that chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and octenidine by 7% of the dentists. using the in vitro model, with the exception of s. aureus, chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. in contrast, the treatment with octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. the 80% alcohol was more efficient. no growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. on the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be  preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or octenidine using an incubation time  of 15 min with ultrasonication.

TI  == controlled release of vancomycin from cross-linked gelatine.
AB  == this paper explores the possibility of using biodegradable cross-linked gelatines as antibiotic devices for a long-term elution (80 days). capillary electrophoresis (ce) has been utilized to evaluate the mass percentage of vancomycin and gelatine contemporary released from differently cross-linked vancomycin loaded gelatine samples in an elution time ranging from 24 to 1920 h.  while the solubilization kinetic of gelatine samples differently cross-linked can be very close described by the simplified higuchi model, the vancomycin release kinetic is contemporary governed by both the fickian diffusion process trough the gelatine matrix network and the dissolution process of the matrix due to its degradation. comparing the antibiotic eluting kinetics from gelatine at diverse cross-linking degree we observed that the degradation of the proteic matrix appears to have a minor influence in the drug release control. vancomycin released from all the gelatine partially cross-linked samples results active against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis which represent the most pathogens commonly isolated in orthopaedic infections. vancomycin overcomes the minimum inhibitory concentration for both the bacteria in the whole range of elution time. cross-linked gelatine devices appear to represent a useful biodegradable delivery system for local anti-infective therapy in arthoplasty.

TI  == mathematical models of cobalt and iron ions catalyzed microwave bacterial deactivation.
AB  == time differences for enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli survival during microwave irradiation (power 130 w) in the presence of aqueous cobalt and iron ions were investigated. measured dependencies had "bell" shape forms with maximum bacterial viability between 1 - 2 min becoming insignificant at 3 minutes. the deactivation time for e. faecalis, s. aureus and e.coli in the presence of metal ions were smaller compared to a water  control (4 -5 min). although various sensitivities to the metal ions were observed, s. aureus and e. coli and were the most sensitive for cobalt and iron,  respectively. the rapid reduction of viable bacteria during microwave treatment in the presence of metal ions could be explained by increased metal ion penetration into bacteria. additionally, microwave irradiation may have increased the kinetic energy of the metal ions resulting in lower survival rates. the proposed mathematical model for microwave heating took into account the "growth"  and "death" factors of the bacteria, forming second degree polynomial functions.  good relationships were found between the proposed mathematical models and the experimental data for bacterial deactivation (coefficient of correlation 0.91 - 0.99).

TI  == functional and structural properties of cbpa, a collagen-binding protein from arcanobacterium pyogenes.
AB  == arcanobacterium pyogenes, an opportunistic pathogen of economically important food animals, is the causative agent of liver abscesses in feedlot cattle, osteomyelitis in turkeys, and pneumonia and arthritis in pigs. previous studies identified the first a. pyogenes adhesin, cbpa, a protein located on the bacterial surface which has the ability to bind collagen and promotes adhesion to the host cells. the protein has an n-terminal ligand-binding region (region a) and a c-terminal repetitive domain (region b). in this study we found that cbpa bound to almost all the collagen types tested but not to other proteins, and it displayed a propensity to interact with several collagenous peptides derived by cnbr cleavage of type i and ii collagens. the k(d) values of cbpa for type i and  ii collagens and collagen peptides determined by solid-phase binding assay and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence were in the range of 1-15 nm. it was also found that cbpa and its a region bound fibronectin, and that collagen and fibronectin interacted with distinct subsites. anti-cbpa antibodies were effective at inhibiting both binding of isolated cbpa and bacterial adhesion to immobilized collagen, suggesting that cbpa is a functional collagen-binding adhesin. analysis of the immunological cross-reactivity of cbpa with antibodies against other bacterial collagen-binding proteins indicated that cbpa is immunologically related to ace from enterococcus faecalis but not to cna from staphylococcus aureus or acm from enterococcus faecium. far-uv and near-uv circular dichroism spectra showed that full-length cbpa and its region a are mainly composed of beta-sheet with only a minor alpha-helical component and that both the proteins have a well-defined tertiary structure.

TI  == new antimicrobial agents as therapy for resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == vancomycin- and methicillin-resistant gram-positive cocci have emerged as an increasingly problematic cause of hospital-acquired infections. we conducted a literature review of newer antibiotics with activity against vancomycin-resistant and methicillin-resistant gram-positive cocci. quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline have in vitro activity for methicillin-resistant staphylococci and are superior to vancomycin for vancomycin-resistant isolates. dalbavancin, telavancin, and oritavancin are new glycopeptides that have superior pharmacodynamic properties compared to vancomycin. we review the antibacterial spectrum, clinical indications and contraindications, pharmacologic properties, and adverse events associated with each of these agents. daptomycin has rapid bactericidal activity for staphylococcus aureus and is approved for use in bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis. linezolid is comparable to vancomycin in patients with methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) pneumonia and has pharmacoeconomic advantages given its oral formulation. quinupristin/dalfopristin is the drug of choice for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections but has no activity against enterococcus faecalis. tigecycline has activity against both enterococcus species and mrsa; it is also active against enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes which allows for use in intra-abdominal and diabetic foot infections. a review of numerous in vitro and animal model studies shows that interaction between these newer agents and other antistaphylococcal agents for s. aureus are  usually indifferent (additive).

TI  == development of flexible antimicrobial films using essential oils as active agents.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity in the vapor-phase of laboratory-made flexible films of polypropylene (pp) and polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (pe/evoh) incorporating essential oil of cinnamon ( cinnamomum zeylanicum), oregano ( origanum vulgare), clove ( syzygium aromaticum), or cinnamon fortified with cinnamaldehyde was evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms: the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella choleraesuis; the gram-positive bacteria listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis; the molds penicillium islandicum, penicillium roqueforti, penicillium nalgiovense, eurotium repens, and a spergillus flavus and the yeasts candida albicans, debaryomyces hansenii, and zigosaccharomyces rouxii. films with a nominal concentration of 4% (w/w) of fortified cinnamon or oregano essential oil  completely inhibited the growth of the fungi; higher concentrations were required to inhibit the gram-positive bacteria (8 and 10%, respectively), and higher concentrations still were necessary to inhibit the gram-negative bacteria. pp films were more effective than pe/evoh films. the atmospheres generated by the antimicrobial films inside petri dishes were quantitatively analyzed using headspace-single drop microextraction (hs-sdme) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the analyses showed that the oregano-fortified pp films released higher levels of carvacrol and thymol, and the cinnamon-fortified pp films released higher levels of cinnamaldehyde, during  the first 3-6 h of incubation, than the corresponding pe/evoh films. shelf-life tests were also performed, demonstrating that the antifungal activities of the films persisted for more than two months after their manufacture. in addition, migration tests (overall and specific) were performed, using both aqueous and fatty simulants, to ensure that the films meet eu regulations regarding food contact materials. following contact with the tested films, the substances that had migrated into the aqueous simulants were recovered by direct immersion-single drop extraction (di-sdme) and then analyzed by gc-ms. the fatty stimulant (isooctane) was directly injected into the chromatographic system.

TI  == susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to antimicrobial agents at different ward levels in four north european countries.
AB  == a multicentre susceptibility study was performed on staphylococci and enterococci isolated from patients at 3 different ward levels: primary care centres (pccs), general hospital wards (ghws) and intensive care units (icus), in denmark, finland, norway and sweden. there was a markedly higher incidence of resistance among cons in icus compared to ghws and pccs. resistance rates were low among s.  aureus isolates and no differences were found between the ward levels. oxacillin  resistance was found among 1.6% of s. aureus and 47% of cons isolates. 14% of cons and 0.9% of s. aureus isolates were glycopeptide intermediate. the prevalence of e. faecium isolates in this study differed significantly between the ward levels with the lowest prevalence found at pccs. high level gentamicin resistant (hlgr) enterococci occurred in 11-25% of e. faecium and 6-20% of e. faecalis isolates. the hlgr rate was significantly higher among e. faecalis from  hospitalized patients (ghws and icus) compared to patients at pccs. for enterococcal isolates, no other significant differences in antimicrobial resistance were found between the ward levels. all enterococci were teicoplanin susceptible, but decreased susceptibility to vancomycin was found among 2.0% and  0.6% of the e. faecium and e. faecalis isolates, respectively.

TI  == [species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests by the fully automated raisus using an early-harvested cell suspension].
AB  == we evaluated the usefulness of an early-harvested bacterial cell suspension to the fully automated raisus (nissui pharmaceuticals co., ltd., tokyo) to provide the results of species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testings within a day after overnight-incubation of the primary cultures. a single, well-separated colony appeared on the primary culture plate was transferred onto  a blood agar or chocolate agar plates, then incubated for 3 to 6 hours. the cell  suspension to the raisus was properly prepared to the mcfarland 0.5 turbidity from the early-harvested bacterial cells. when the five atcc reference strains, consisting of staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619, escherichia coli atcc 25922 and pseudomonas  aeruginosa atcc 27853, were repeatedly tested for the species-identification, all the identification results were acceptable. antimicrobial susceptibility tests were evaluated with the above five strains and haemophilus influenzae atcc 49247. the results obtained indicated that the most susceptibility test results were comparable to those mics obtained by the standard test procedure, but some strains, in particular, h. influenzae and p. aeruginosa gave significantly discrepant mics for certain antimicrobial agents. the significant discrepancy in  mic determinations regarded the difference of viable cell concentrations in the cell suspension prepared respectively. through the analysis of laboratory workflow, it became to apparent that 18s to 20s of the tests were completed by 5:00 p.m., and it required to wait until 3:00 a.m. to complete 90s of the tests.  with these results, the early-harvested bacterial cell suspension is applicable to species-identification by raisus, but it is necessary to adjust viable cell concentrations to antimicrobial susceptibility test. also, it is urgent to reconstitute a daily workflow to improve the rapidity of raisus test function.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis constitutes an unusual bacterial model in lysozyme resistance.
AB  == lysozyme is an important and widespread compound of the host constitutive defense system, and it is assumed that enterococcus faecalis is one of the few bacteria that are almost completely lysozyme resistant. on the basis of the sequence analysis of the whole genome of e. faecalis v583 strain, we identified two genes  that are potentially involved in lysozyme resistance, ef_0783 and ef_1843. protein products of these two genes share significant homology with staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan o-acetyltransferase (oata) and streptococcus  pneumoniae n-acetylglucosamine deacetylase (pgda), respectively. in order to determine whether ef_0783 and ef_1843 are involved in lysozyme resistance, we constructed their corresponding mutants and a double mutant. the deltaef_0783 mutant and deltaef_0783 deltaef_1843 double mutant were shown to be more sensitive to lysozyme than the parental e. faecalis jh2-2 strain and deltaef_1843 mutant were. however, compared to other bacteria, such as listeria monocytogenes  or s. pneumoniae, the tolerance of deltaef_0783 and deltaef_0783 deltaef_1843 mutants towards lysozyme remains very high. peptidoglycan structure analysis showed that ef_0783 modifies the peptidoglycan by o acetylation of n-acetyl muramic acid, while the ef_1843 deletion has no obvious effect on peptidoglycan structure under the same conditions. moreover, the ef_0783 and ef_1843 deletions  seem to significantly affect the ability of e. faecalis to survive within murine  macrophages. in all, while ef_0783 is currently involved in the lysozyme resistance of e. faecalis, peptidoglycan o acetylation and de-n-acetylation are not the main mechanisms conferring high levels of lysozyme resistance to e. faecalis.

TI  == the antimicrobial and antifungal activity of a root canal core material.
AB  == background: the authors conducted an in vitro study to determine the antimicrobial and antifungal activity of a recently introduced thermoplastic, synthetic, polymer-based polyester root canal core material (resilon, resilon research, madison, conn.) against five different microorganisms by means of the agar diffusion test over different periods. methods: the microorganisms tested were enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, porphyromonas endodontalis and candida albicans. a microbiologist transferred resilon cones and gutta-percha cones to the inoculated agar and incubated them at 37 c, either aerobically or anaerobically, as required for optimal growth. results: the resilon cones exhibited no antimicrobial effect against any of the bacteria tested, except for s. aureus. it showed antimicrobial efficacy against s. aureus during the first 24-hour period (p < .05). however, after 48 and 72 hours, resilon cones no longer inhibited the growth of s. aureus. in addition, the material demonstrated no antifungal activity during any of the three testing  periods. conclusion: the results of this study indicate that the antibacterial and antifungal efficacy of the resilon cone is not superior to that of conventional gutta-percha. clinical implications: clinicians should not use the new root canal core material for its antimicrobial or antifungal efficacy.

TI  == bacteria induce ctgf and cyr61 expression in epithelial cells in a lysophosphatidic acid receptor-dependent manner.
AB  == cysteine-rich protein 61 (cyr61/ccn1) and connective tissue growth factor (ctgf/ccn2) are members of the ccn (cyr61, ctgf, nephroblastoma overexpressed gene) family and exert pleiotropic functions such as regulation of adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix deposition, or cell differentiation, and play an  important role in wound healing. this study focused on the nature of the so far unknown ctgf and cyr61 mrna expression of epithelial cells after infection with bacteria. we demonstrate that infection of epithelial cells with attenuated yersinia enterocolitica lacking the virulence plasmid pyv leads to the expression of cyr61 and ctgf. virulent y. enterocolitica bearing the pyv virulence plasmid suppressed the mrna expression of these genes. yersinia-mediated inhibition of ctgf and cyr61 mrna expression is partially mediated by the cysteine protease yopt. further characterization of the yersinia factors, which trigger ctgf and cyr61 mrna expression, demonstrated that these factors were secreted and could be enriched in lipid extracts. beside yersinia, several other bacteria such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, or staphylococcus aureus, as well as supernatants of these bacteria induced ctgf and cyr61 expression. blocking experiments with the lysophosphatidic acid (lpa) receptor-specific inhibitor ki16425 suggest a general involvement of lpa receptors in bacteria-triggered ctgf and cyr61 expression. these data suggest that lpa receptor-dependent expression of ctgf and cyr61 represents a common host response after interaction with bacteria.

TI  == penetration of gatifloxacin eye drops into the aqueous humor in humans.
AB  == the authors topically administered gatifloxacin (gflx) into the eye before cataract surgery and measured the concentrations of this agent to determine its penetration into aqueous humor. seventy-seven patients with age-related cataracts who underwent cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. they received 0.3% gflx ophthalmic solution 4 times at 30-min intervals, beginning 2 h before surgery. aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for gflx concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. the mean intraoperative gflx concentration in aqueous humor was 0.485 +/- 0.328 microg/ml. gflx level was 0.573 +/- 0.367 microg/ml in elderly patients, at least 70 years of age, and was significantly higher than that (0.322 +/- 0.135 microg/ml) in the patients less than 70 years old. this concentration was close to or higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 90% of major pathogens of endophthalmitis (mic90), such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis associated with poor prognosis, other than staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) in vitro. the gflx concentrations found in aqueous humor samples were sufficient to kill bacteria other than s. epidermidis, p. aeruginosa, and mrsa in vitro.

TI  == development of a surgical site infection (ssi) surveillance system, calculation of ssi rates and specification of important factors affecting ssi in a digestive  organ surgical department.
AB  == we have developed an original system to conduct surgical site infection (ssi) surveillance. this system accumulates ssi surveillance information based on the national nosocomial infections surveillance (nnis) system and the japanese nosocomial infections surveillance (jnis) system. the features of this system are as follows: easy input of data, high generality, data accuracy, ssi rate by operative procedure and risk index category (ric) can be promptly calculated and  compared with the current nnis ssi rate, and the ssi rates and accumulated data can be exported electronically. using this system, we monitored 798 patients in 24 operative procedure categories in the digestive organs surgery department of mazda hospital, mazda motor corporation, from january 2004 through december 2005. the total number and rate of ssi were 47 and 5.89%, respectively. the ssi rates of 777 patients were calculated based on 15 operative procedure categories and risk index categories (ric). the highest ssi rate was observed in the rectum surgery of ric 1 (30%), followed by the colon surgery of ric3 (28.57%). about 30% of the isolated infecting bacteria were enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. using quantification theory type 2, the american society of anesthesiology score  (4.531), volume of hemorrhage under operation (3.075), wound classification (1.76), operation time (1.352), and history of diabetes (0.989) increased to higher ranks as factors for ssi. therefore, we evaluated this system as a useful  tool in safety control for operative procedures.

AB  == background: although many patients with ie complain of joint, muscle, and back pain, infections at these sights are rare. indeed, in patients with back pain and endocarditis, less than 4% actually demonstrate spondylodiscitis. case description: we recently encountered 4 patients with this complication, one each  caused by staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mitis, and enterococcus faecalis, and wondered whether the nature of the infecting organism  determined the development of spondylodiscitis and epidural abscess. in a literature review, 36 patients with endocarditis and spondylodiscitis were identified. only 9 (25%) were caused by streptococcus viridans and the remainder  by staphylococci, enterococci, and other streptococci. usually more than 50% of all cases of ie were caused by streptococcus viridans, although more recent studies would indicate an incidence of about 40%. conclusion: we conclude that spondylodiscitis with epidural abscess is more likely to occur in those patients  with endocarditis who are infected by organisms with pyogenic potential.

TI  == qsar studies on benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as inhibitors of beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase iii.
AB  == fatty acid biosynthesis is essential for most of the bacterial survival. components of this biosynthetic pathway have been identified as attractive targets for the development of new antibacterial agents. fabh, beta-ketoacyl-acp  synthase iii, is a attractive target since it is central to the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis. quantitative structure-activity relationship (qsar) studies have been carried out on a series of benzoylaminobenzoic acid derivatives as potent inhibitors of fabh and antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis,  neisseria meningitidis and escherichia coli, which demonstrate fabh inhibitory activity in cell free and whole cell system. the qsar studies revealed that inhibitory activity increases with increase in hydrophobicity, molar refractivity, aromaticity, and presence of oh group (on x position of the nucleus). on the other side presence of hetero-atoms like n, o, or s at r(1) position of the nucleus decreases the inhibitory activity. the comparison of qsar between the fabh inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, n. meningitidis also demonstrates that the hydrophobicity, aromaticity and presence of oh group (on x  position of the nucleus) are conducive for the inhibitory activity.

TI  == gram-positive bloodstream infections in liver transplant recipients: incidence, risk factors, and impact on survival.
AB  == the objective of the study was to assess the incidence, risk factors, and survival of gram-positive bloodstream infections (gp-bsi(s)) among liver transplant recipients during the first year after transplantation. between october 2000 and september 2006, 42 episodes of gp-bsi(s) occurred in 205 patients with an overall incidence of 0.20 episodes/patient. coagulase-negative staphylococci were detected in 45.2% of cases, enterococcus species in 42.9% (e faecalis, eight; e faecium, seven; e avium, two; e gallinarum, one) and staphylococcus aureus in 11.9%. retransplantation was the only independent risk factor for gp-bsi (odds ratio [or], 0.253; 95% confidence interval (ci), 0.089 to 0.715; p = .009). thirty-day mortality rate was 28.5% and s aureus infections were related to a poorer outcome. it is noteworthy that all the isolates of s aureus were methicillin-resistant. ampicillin was inactive against all the strains of e faecium and 50% of e avium isolates, but active against all e faecalis and e gallinarum strains. all the isolates were glycopeptide-susceptible. no significant differences in mortality rate were observed in relation to sex, etiologies of end-stage liver disease, cytomegalovirus infection/reinfection, type of donor, rejection, or retransplantation. gp-bsi, the only independent risk factor for death (or, 0.262; 95% ci, 0.106 to 0.643; p = .003), reduced the survival rate by 26% in the first  year posttransplant. in conclusion, gp-bsi(s) impact significantly on morbidity and mortality posttransplant, particularly among retransplantations. control measures are required to reduce the incidence of gp-bsi(s) in liver transplant recipients. these findings must be considered when empirical antimicrobial therapy is indicated while awaiting blood-culture results.

TI  == factors influencing broth microdilution antimicrobial susceptibility test results for dalbavancin, a new glycopeptide agent.
AB  == performance of antimicrobial susceptibility tests with new agents requires careful consideration of the properties of the antimicrobial to ensure that the tests are standardized, reproducible, and reflect the true potency of the drug. dalbavancin is a new glycopeptide with potent activity against gram-positive bacterial species. the investigations described here demonstrated that methodologic modifications of procedures are necessary to ensure consistent test  results, both for quality control and for routine testing of clinical isolates. dimethyl sulfoxide is the preferred primary solvent. the addition of 0.002% polysorbate-80 (a surfactant) to dalbavancin-containing wells in the reference broth microdilution assay resulted in consistent and reproducible mic results for three quality control strains: staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, and streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 49619. the same degree of  consistency was observed among clinical isolates of gram-positive bacterial species tested in several clinical laboratories. these results indicate that the  addition of 0.002% (final concentration) of the surfactant in broth microdilution tests produces optimal dalbavancin mics required for accurate and reproducible clinical laboratory tests, without untoward influences of substrate binding or media constituents.

TI  == enterococci and streptococci.
AB  == besides staphylococcus aureus, other gram-positive bacteria have become multidrug-resistant and cause therapeutic problems, particularly amongst hospitalised patients. the acquisition of vancomycin resistance by strains of enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis is of particular concern and has resulted in treatment failures. some of the infections caused by these bacteria do respond to treatment with new antibiotics that have been released in the last  few years, however more options are required as not all enterococci are inherently susceptible and resistance is beginning to emerge amongst those that were susceptible. resistance to commonly used antibiotics is also emerging in streptococcus spp., particularly to the tetracyclines and macrolides. in both genera, multiresistant strains spread between patients and between hospitals. in  the laboratory, these bacteria show considerable susceptibility to tigecycline, with little propensity to develop resistance, indicating that tigecycline could assume an important role in controlling infections caused by these gram-positive  bacteria.

AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) surveillance program was designed to monitor the antimicrobial potency and spectrum of meropenem, and selected broad-spectrum comparison agents against pathogens from hospitalized patients. in the 2006 (year 8 of the study) united states sample, a total of 2841 isolates (94.7% compliance) including 641 escherichia coli, 619 klebsiella spp., 606 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 456 oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 300 streptococci, 149 enterococcus faecalis, and 70 gram-positive anaerobic organisms were tested by reference broth microdilution or agar dilution susceptibility methods. the carbapenems, especially meropenem, consistently demonstrated the lowest resistance rates against enterobacteriaceae strains, and the fluoroquinolones had the highest and  increasing resistance rates. the presence of qnr-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance was investigated using polymerase chain reaction methods but was only  observed at very low levels (2.1%) and was not clonally associated. confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates for e. coli and klebsiella spp. were only  4.8% and 5.0%, respectively, with mobile ampc (cmy-2 and fox-5) enzymes shown in  13 additional enterobacteriaceae isolates. clonally related kpc-type serine carbapenemase production (57 strains, 9.5%) was observed at a rate 2-fold greater than the prior year among klebsiella spp. isolates, primarily from 1 geographic region (middle atlantic states). these mystic program (2006) results demonstrate  the continued need to monitor the carbapenem class potency and spectrum of activity against enterobacteriaceae as well as p. aeruginosa because of the documented presence of serine carbapenemases and rare incidence of metallo-beta-lactamases that may further compromise their activity and that of other beta-lactam agents.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of silver-containing dressings on wound microorganisms using an in vitro biofilm model.
AB  == antimicrobial dressings such as those containing silver are now being used widely to control wound bioburden, and tests to demonstrate their efficacy predominantly involve in vitro models using free-living or planktonic bacteria. in this present study a wide range of antibiotic-sensitive and resistant bacteria were tested in  their quasi-sessile state using a standard agar assay and a second method used a  poloxamer gel (true biofilm state - poloxamer encourages microorganisms to exhibit a more clinically relevant biofilm phenotype) technique. the antimicrobial activity of two silver dressings, a silver-containing hydrofiber (sch) dressing and a nanocrystalline silver-containing dressing (ncs), were evaluated on a variety of microorganisms, using a zone-of-inhibition (zoi) test.  when grown on agar (presenting a quasi-sessile state of each organism), the antibiotic-susceptible microorganisms were generally more susceptible to the sch  dressing compared with the ncs. zois associated with sch dressing ranged between  5.7 and 17.5 mm; those for the ncs against the same group of organisms ranged between 1.9 and 8.6 mm. when grown on poloxamer gel, (presenting the biofilm state of each organism) the same group of microorganisms were less susceptible to both dressings. the sch dressing was most effective against strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus (zoi range: 2.6-6 mm); the ncs was most effective against strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli (i.e. zoi range: 1-2.8 mm). similarly  to the antibiotic-susceptible microorganisms, nine of ten antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains when grown on agar were more susceptible to the sch dressing compared with the ncs. although the microorganisms tested were universally less susceptible to the silver dressings when in their biofilm state, in the majority  of cases, the sch dressing demonstrated greater biofilm-inhibiting activity than  the ncs.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  == this study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 0.015-0.5mg/l, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and mr staphylococci. tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci, with mics for 90% of the organisms (mic(90)) of 0.25 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, being more active than linezolid (mic(90)=2 mg/l) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (mic(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/l, respectively). molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(m), erm(b) and erm(c) in streptococcus agalactiae; tet(o), variably associated with different erm genes, in streptococcus pyogenes; vana, tet(m) and erm(b) in enterococcus faecalis, and  vana and erm(b) in enterococcus faecium. all the mrsa strains harboured sccmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(k) with tet(m) genes. staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. these results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a mic(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/l both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == in vitro activity of para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene against susceptible and antibiotic-resistant gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == objectives: emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has encouraged vigorous efforts to develop antimicrobial agents with new mechanisms of action. in this study, the in vitro antibacterial activity of para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene was evaluated and compared with that of its constitutive monomer, para-guanidinoethylphenol. hexamidine, a widely used antiseptic, and synthalin a, an old antidiabetic and anti-trypanosomal compound, were chosen as references. methods: mic and mbc were determined for five reference strains (escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and atcc 29213, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853), as well as five antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates. toxicity on mrc-5 and hacat eukaryotic cell lines was also evaluated by mtt and neutral red assays. results: no antibacterial activity was observed for para-guanidinoethylphenol (mic >or= 512 mg/l) and synthalin a (mic >or= 64 mg/l). conversely, para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene and hexamidine: (i) showed a broad antibacterial spectrum, both on gram-positive and on gram-negative bacteria (mic = 4 mg/l against e. coli and 8 mg/l against s. aureus for para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene), to a lesser degree against e. faecalis and p.  aeruginosa (mic = 32 mg/l); (ii) were bacteriostatic (mbc >or= 256 mg/l); and (iii) mics and mbcs obtained for clinical isolates were similar to those obtained with reference strains. both compounds, the monomer and the calixarene, showed no apparent cytotoxicity, whereas hexamidine and synthalin a had significant toxic effects that increased with time and concentration and in a range of 100-1000 times that for calixarene. conclusions: in conclusion, results confirm para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene as a broad-spectrum new agent or an auxiliary in antimicrobial chemotherapy.

TI  == role of a qnr-like gene in the intrinsic resistance of enterococcus faecalis to fluoroquinolones.
AB  == fluoroquinolones are poorly active against enterococci. recently, plasmid-borne resistance to fluoroquinolones due to the qnr gene was reported in members of the enterobacteriaceae family. the gene encodes a pentapeptide repeat protein that protects dna gyrase from inhibition by fluoroquinolones. we have identified in the genome of enterococcus faecalis v583 a qnr-like gene, named e. faecalis qnr (qnr(e. faecalis)), encoding a putative pentapeptide repeat protein that shares 25% identity with qnr. to assess its potential role in the intrinsic resistance of e. faecalis to fluoroquinolones, qnr(e. faecalis) was inactivated in e. faecalis jh2-2 by insertion of the thermosensitive vector pg1kt. this strain was  then complemented with qnr(e. faecalis) cloned in the multicopy plasmid pori23. the effects of its overexpression were also studied. inactivation of the qnr(e. faecalis) gene resulted in twofold decreases in the mics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. when the gene was complemented or overexpressed, mics of fluoroquinolones increased four- to nine-fold, leading to mics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin equal to 32 mug/ml and 8 mug/ml, respectively. the e. faecalis qnr  (qnr(e. faecalis)) protein was produced and purified. qnr(e. faecalis) protein protected escherichia coli dna gyrase from inhibition by ofloxacin. the qnr(e. faecalis) gene was then introduced into e. coli dh10b, staphylococcus aureus rn4220, and lactococcus lactis il-1419 to study its heterologous expression. mics of the various fluoroquinolones tested increased 4- to 16-fold, showing that qnr(e. faecalis) conferred resistance to fluoroquinolones in various bacterial backgrounds. overexpression of qnr(e. faecalis) in enterococci or mobilization of the gene to other bacterial species may be anticipated as a possible new mechanism for fluoroquinolone resistance.

TI  == antiviral and antimicrobial activities of three sesquiterpene lactones from centaurea solstitialis l. ssp. solstitialis.
AB  == three sesquiterpene lactones (centaurepensin = chlorohyssopifolin a, chlorojanerin and 13-acetyl solstitialin a) isolated from the aerial parts of centaurea solstitialis l. ssp. solstitialis (asteraceae) were investigated for antimicrobial and antiviral activities. for the antimicrobial activity assessment, both standard and isolated strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans and c. parapsilosis were employed by the microdilution method. herpes simplex type-1, a  dna virus, and parainfluenza, an rna virus, were employed for the determination of the antiviral activity of these three sesquiterpene lactones using vero cell lines. ampicilline, ofloxocine, ketoconazole, fluconazole, acyclovir and oseltamivir were used as the reference drugs. 13-acetyl solstitialin a displayed  remarkable antibacterial activity against isolated strains of e. faecalis at 1 microg/ml concentration, which was close to the effective concentrations of ampicillin. the same compound also showed significant activity against the dna virus, being as potent as the reference compound acyclovir at maximum and minimum concentrations of 16-<0.00006 microg/ml. this is the first report showing that 13-acetyl solstitialin a possesses significant antiviral activity.

TI  == evaluation of ceftobiprole medocaril against enterococcus faecalis in a mouse peritonitis model.
AB  == objectives: ceftobiprole is a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with good in vitro activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. the objective of this study was to assess the in vivo activity of ceftobiprole against four strains of e. faecalis, including beta-lactamase- producing (bla+) and vancomycin-resistant strains. methods: mice  were infected intraperitoneally with strains of e. faecalis: (i) the bla+ strain  hh22; (ii) two vancomycin-resistant strains (tx2484 and v583); and (iii) og1rf (a laboratory strain), using 10 x the ld50 for each strain. ceftobiprole doses of 25, 12.5 and 6.25 mg/kg (single doses) and ampicillin 50, 25, 12.5 and 6.25 mg/kg (single and double doses) were administered subcutaneously immediately after bacterial challenge and mice were monitored for 96 h. results: all four e. faecalis had ceftobiprole mics <or=0.5 mg/l. despite being susceptible in vitro at the standard inoculum, ampicillin (single and double doses) did not protect mice against intraperitoneal challenge with bla+ e. faecalis hh22, with a 50% protective dose (pd50) of >100 mg/kg, whereas ceftobiprole was protective (pd50 of 2 mg/kg). ceftobiprole pd50s for vancomycin-resistant isolates tx2484 and v583 were 7.7 and 5.2 mg/kg, respectively, similar to those of single dose ampicillin  (12.5 and 16.4 mg/kg, respectively). for og1rf, both ampicillin and ceftobiprole  protected all mice at doses of 25 and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively, with a pd50 of 4.2 and 8 mg/kg for ceftobiprole and ampicillin, respectively. conclusions: ceftobiprole had comparable in vivo activity to that of ampicillin against vancomycin-resistant and ampicillin-susceptible strains of e. faecalis in the mouse peritonitis model. ceftobiprole was superior in vivo to ampicillin against  the bla+ strain hh22. our data support the further study of ceftobiprole as a therapeutic agent in humans infected with e. faecalis.

TI  == bactericidal synergism through enterocin as-48 and chemical preservatives against staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == aims: to determine the effectiveness of enterocin as-48 on staphylococcus aureus  cect 976 in combination with chemical preservatives at acidic and neutral ph. methods and results: at ph 4.5, the activity of as-48 increases in the presence of lactic acid (1.0%), acetic acid (0.5% and 1.0%), and citric acid (0.3% and 0.6%). this synergistic effect has also been observed during the first 8 h of incubation with benzoate (0.06% and 0.12%) and sorbate (2% and 3%). interestingly, at ph 7, lactate (1%) increases the inhibitory effect of as-48, reducing the s. aureus population by 6 log units compared with the control culture. at neutral ph, combinations of as-48 and sodium tripolyphosphate, stpp (0.3% and 0.5%) also eliminate this pathogen after 24 h. conclusions: these results indicate that enterocin as-48 could be applied in combination with a range of chemical preservatives in order to increase its efficacy in inhibiting s. aureus. significance and impact of the study: this study supports the potential use of enterocin as-48 as a biopreservative to control s. aureus in combination with other food-grade chemical hurdles.

TI  == characterization and mechanistic studies of type ii isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase from staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the recently identified type ii isopentenyl diphosphate (ipp):dimethylallyl diphosphate (dmapp) isomerase (idi-2) is a flavoenzyme that requires fmn and nad(p)h for activity. idi-2 is an essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids in several pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis, and thus is considered as a  potential new drug target to battle bacterial infections. one notable feature of  the idi-2 reaction is that there is no net change in redox state between the substrate (ipp) and product (dmapp), indicating that the fmn cofactor must start  and finish each catalytic cycle in the same redox state. here, we report the characterization and initial mechanistic studies of the s. aureus idi-2. the steady-state kinetic analyses under aerobic and anaerobic conditions show that fmn must be reduced to be catalytically active and the overall idi-2 reaction is  o2-sensitive. interestingly, our results demonstrate that nadph is needed only in catalytic amounts to activate the enzyme for multiple turnovers of ipp to dmapp.  the hydride transfer from nad(p)h to reduce fmn is determined to be pro-s stereospecific. photoreduction and oxidation-reduction potential studies reveal that the s. aureus idi-2 can stabilize significant amounts of the neutral fmn semiquinone. in addition, reconstitution of apo-idi-2 with 5-deazafmn resulted in a dead enzyme, whereas reconstitution with 1-deazafmn led to the full recovery of enzyme activity. taken together, these studies appear to support a catalytic mechanism in which the reduced flavin coenzyme mediates a single electron transfer to and from the ipp substrate during catalysis.

AB  == visible light induced photocatalytic inactivation of bacteria (escherichia coli,  staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and fungi (candida albicans, aspergillus niger) was tested. carbon-doped titanium dioxide and tio2 modified with platinum(iv) chloride complexes were used as suspension or immobilised at the surface of plastic plates. a biocidal effect was observed under visible light irradiation in the case of e. coli in the presence of both photocatalysts. the platinum(iv) modified titania exhibited a higher inactivation effect, also in the absence of light. the mechanism of visible light induced photoinactivation is briefly discussed. the observed detrimental effect of photocatalysts on various microorganism groups decreases in the order: e. coli > s. aureus approximately e. faecalis>>c. albicans approximately a. niger. this sequence results most probably from differences in cell wall or cell membrane structures in these microorganisms and is not related to the ability of catalase production.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) against bacteria with defined resistance mechanisms and phenotypes.
AB  == background: ceftaroline (ppi-0903m, t-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an n-phosphono prodrug. we investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. methods: mics were determined by clsi agar dilution, but with varied inocula. mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. results: mics for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were 0.5-2 mg/l, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible s. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/l, respectively. even with 2% nacl added, all mrsa were susceptible at 2 mg/l. mics for enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/l; e. faecium was resistant. mics for escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., morganella morganii and proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/l versus 0.12-1 mg/l for enterobacter, serratia and citrobacter  spp. and 2-8 mg/l for acinetobacter spp. mics rose to 1-2 mg/l for many enterobacteriaceae with classical tem beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), hyperproduced ampc or k1 enzymes. mics for strains with classical tem/shv beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with esbls. resistance due to class a beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. geometric mean mics were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised mics for beta-lactamase-positive moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. ceftaroline selected ampc-derepressed enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected esbl variants of blatem in e. coli. resistance selection was not seen with s. aureus, h. influenzae or pneumococci. conclusions: ceftaroline has impressive anti-mrsa and anti-pneumococcal activity. slight lability to classical tem and shv beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible  with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by esbls. resistance selection occurred with enterobacteriaceae, not mrsa.

TI  == synthesis and preliminary biological characterization of new semisynthetic derivatives of ramoplanin.
AB  == ramoplanin is a glycolipodepsipeptide antibiotic active against gram-positive bacteria including vancomycin-resistant enterococci. ramoplanin inhibits bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by a mechanism different from that of glycopeptides and hence does not show cross-resistance with these antibiotics. the systemic use of ramoplanin has been so far prevented because of its low local tolerability when injected intravenously. to overcome this problem, the fatty acid side chain of ramoplanin was selectively removed and replaced with a variety of different carboxylic acids. many of the new ramoplanin derivatives showed antimicrobial activity similar to that of the natural precursor coupled with a significantly improved local tolerability. among them the derivative in which the 2-methylphenylacetic acid has replaced the di-unsaturated fatty acid side chain (48) was selected as the most interesting compound and submitted to further in vitro and in vivo characterization studies.

AB  == medical centres in eight countries in the asia-pacific region provided 2391 isolates for the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program during 2003-2004 to determine their susceptibility to several antimicrobial classes, including daptomycin. daptomycin, vancomycin and teicoplanin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were determined for 120 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, which included wild-type (wt) methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and strains with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (hetero-vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (hvisa)).  oxacillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were much less susceptible to the other tested agents compared with oxacillin-susceptible strains. vancomycin resistance was higher among enterococcus faecium (10.3%) than enterococcus faecalis (0.4%), and macrolide resistance was high both for beta-haemolytic (17.7%) and viridans group (48.7%) streptococci. daptomycin (mic for 90% of the organisms (mic(90))=0.5-1mg/l) was two-fold more potent than vancomycin, with >99% susceptibility when tested against staphylococci. all tested isolates of e.  faecalis (mic(90)=2mg/l) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (mic(90)=0.5mg/l) were  susceptible to daptomycin. daptomycin mic and mbc values were slightly higher for the hvisa isolates compared with wt-mrsa, with mbc/mic ratios of only 1-2 for both groups. the mbc/mic ratio for vancomycin was often greater when tested against these strains, particularly hvisa. in contrast, teicoplanin mbc/mic ratios were significantly higher, with many of the strains showing values consistent with tolerance (>or=32). daptomycin was demonstrated to have excellent in vitro activity when tested against gram-positive isolates collected from asia-pacific countries, including hvisa strains.

TI  == mathematical model of manganese ion catalyzed microwave deactivation of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli survival was investigated using microwave irradiation (power 130 w) both in a water control and in the presence of a 1 microm manganese ion solution. measured survival dependencies had "bell" shape form with maximum bacterial viability between 1-2 min of microwave heating. additional heating revealed bacteria survival decreasing up to 3 min of microwave heating when viability became insignificantly small. the total deactivation time of bacteria in the presence of manganese ions  was significantly smaller then that of bacteria irradiated in the microwave without manganese ions present (4-5 min). one possible explanation for the rapid  reduction of bacterial survival during microwave irradiation in the presence of manganese ions is that increasing manganese ion penetration into bacteria along with microwave irradiation related to an increase of kinetic energy of ions, and  damaging of bacteria by metal ions. the proposed mathematical model for microwave heating took into account "growth" and "death" factors of bacteria. it assumes that rates of bacterial growth and decay are linear functions of water temperature, and rate of bacterial decay that relates with metal concentration into water is also linear, which influenced the differential equation for the dependence between number of survival bacteria and temperature water. by using proportionality between the time of microwave heating and water temperature we derived the differential equation, between bacterial viability and time of microwave irradiation which was used as mathematical model for microwave heating  in the presence of metal ions. this model had forms of second-degree polynomial functions. we received good relationships (with coefficient of correlation 0.92-0.99) between proposed mathematical model and experimental data for all bacterial deactivation.

TI  == in-vitro profile of a new beta-lactam, ceftobiprole, with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in-vitro activity against common gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. it forms a stable inhibitory complex with staphylococcus aureus penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 2' (2a), resulting in enhanced activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). in recent studies of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, the ceftobiprole  mic(90) value was most frequently < or =1.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.25-1.0 mg/l). for mrsa, mic(90) values were generally 2.0 mg/l (mic range < or =0.06-4.0 mg/l). mics for all streptococcal species, except penicillin-resistant streptococcus viridans but including penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ranged from < or =0.008 to 2.0 mg/l. ceftobiprole is active against enterococcus faecalis (mic(90) = 4 mg/l), but not generally active against enterococcus faecium (mic(90) > 16 mg/l). ceftobiprole displayed bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogens comparable to that of cefepime, ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam in early studies. however, recent data show activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of cefepime but less than that of  ceftazidime. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is stable in the presence of most class a non-extended spectrum beta-lactamases and inducible class c beta-lactamases. ceftobiprole is a poor inducer of ampc beta-lactamase and a poor substrate for hydrolysis by ampc beta-lactamase. studies of ceftobiprole in several animal models have demonstrated potent in-vivo efficacy against infections caused by mrsa, including strains intermediately resistant to vancomycin. it was also efficacious in murine infections caused by gram-negative bacteria with mic values < or =2 mg/l. the broad spectrum of activity demonstrated by ceftobiprole in vitro and in vivo suggests that it may have potential for empirical treatment of  suspected gram-negative and gram-positive infections, including those caused by mrsa.

TI  == vapor-phase activities of cinnamon, thyme, and oregano essential oils and key constituents against foodborne microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. in a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (eos)-cinnamon (cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (thymus vulgaris), and oregano (origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of  microorganisms, including gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella choleraesuis), gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis), molds (penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (candida albicans). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were generally lower for oregano eo than for the thyme and cinnamon eos, especially against the relatively resistant gram-negative. the persistence of the eos' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (sdme) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (pca). more relevant chemicals were selected. in addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative gram-positive (l. monocytogenes) and gram-negative (s. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (a. flavus), and a yeast (c. albicans). of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their mics, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. to check for possible interactions between components present in the eos, cinnamon eo was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme eo with thymol,  and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified eos using fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on a. flavus and for thymol on l. monocytogenes, s. choleraesuis, and a. flavus. in all other  cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against s. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic. finally, various microorganisms were found to cause slight changes over time to the atmospheres generated by all of the eos (fortified and unfortified) except the fortified cinnamon eo.

TI  == an in vitro system for the comparison of excision and wet-dry swabbing for microbiological sampling of beef carcasses.
AB  == an in vitro system for the comparison of wet-dry swabbing and surface tissue excision was developed to ascertain whether the commonly accepted statement of the advantage (in terms of bacterial recovery) of the tissue excision method is also legitimate when different kinds of bacteria are used. a total of 1,770 sections (2.5 by 10 cm) of bovine skin were individually inoculated on the subcutaneous fat side by spreading various suspensions of marker organisms (nalidixic acid-resistant escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) at different concentrations and sampled by two standard methods: cotton wet-dry swabbing and excision. most counts from cuts sampled by excision were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the wet-dry swabs; however, no differences were observed between the  control and the sampling method when sections were inoculated with bacterial solutions at a concentration of 10(3) cfu/ml and sampled by excision. for sections inoculated with bacterial solutions at a concentration of 10(3) cfu/ml,  counts given as log cfu/25 cm2 ranged from 1.97 (s. aureus sampled by wet-dry swab) to 3.06 (s. aureus sampled by excision). for sections inoculated at a concentration of 10(4), counts given as log cfu/25 cm(2) ranged from 2.15 (e. faecalis sampled by wet-dry swab) to 3.19 (s. aureus sampled by excision). for sections inoculated at 10(5), counts given as log cfu/25 cm(2) ranged from 2.94 (e. faecalis, wet-dry swab) to 3.98 (s. aureus, excision), and for sections inoculated at 106, counts given as log cfu/25 cm(2) ranged from 3.53 (e. coli, wet-dry swab) to 4.69 (s. aureus, excision). the proposed system, which enabled a considerable amount of samples to be analyzed under controlled experimental conditions and a large number of data to be generated in a short time, demonstrated among the tested microorganisms that whereas the excision method recovered the highest number of bacteria, control means were always (with the exception of an inoculum of 10(3)/ml) significantly higher than means from either of the sampling methods. our results indicate that particular attention should be paid to the diverse microflora that can contaminate carcasses in a given slaughterhouse and that it is not appropriate to generalize by saying that the destructive method is the reference technique for the bacteriological sampling of carcasses in slaughterhouses, especially when the contamination is higher than 10(3) cfu/25 cm(2).

TI  == application of real-time quantitative pcr for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  == bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using taqman(r) real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr). thirteen probe and primer sets were  tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella sp., and staphylococcus aureus. the sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic dna (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using a. hydrophila purified dna. samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. in duplicate samples, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. perfringens and e. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater  and final effluent stage. this qpcr method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the environment canada guidelines.

AB  == the antibacterial activities of the series of novel n'-(alpha-aminoacyl)- and n'-alpha-(n-akylamino)acyl derivatives of eremomycin and vancomycin containing hydrophobic moieties have been investigated. the n'-(n-alkylglycyl) derivatives of vancomycin are more active against vancomycin-susceptible staphylococci and enterococci and glycopeptide intermediate-resistant staphylococcus aureus (gisa)  than the corresponding eremomycin derivatives, but except for n'-[n-(p-octyloxybenzyl)glycyl-vancomycin] (28) and n'-[n-(p-octyloxybenzyl)-l-alanyl-vancomycin (33)--they are less active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre). derivatives 28 and 33 are the most active compounds (mic's for glycopeptide-sensitive staphylococci and enterococci  are 0.25 approximately 1 microg/ml, for gisa 1 approximately 2 microg/ml, for gre 2 approximately 6 microg/ml). in in vivo studies, derivative 28 was active against s. aureus infections in mice with ed(50) 1 mg/kg versus 2 mg/kg for vancomycin (iv). in general n'-(n-alkylglycyl)-derivatives of vancomycin and eremomycin were more active than the corresponding n'-aminoacylated derivatives of these antibiotics containing other than glycin amino acids (l-lys, l-met, l-orn, l- and d-ala) and also l- and d-phe or benzyl-o-l-tyr.

TI  == reduced mucosal antimicrobial activity in crohn's disease of the colon.
AB  == objectives: in order to maintain the mucosal barrier against luminal microorganisms the intestinal epithelial cells synthesise various broad-spectrum  antimicrobial peptides including defensins and cathelicidins. recent studies indicate that both may be deficient in crohn's disease. to elucidate the possible functional consequences of this deficiency antimicrobial activity in colonic mucosa from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and healthy controls was investigated. methods: a flow cytometric assay was established to quantitate bacterial killing and test the antibacterial activity of cationic peptide extracts from colonic biopsies taken from patients with active or inactive ileocolonic or colonic crohn's disease (n = 22), ulcerative colitis (n = 29) and  controls (n = 13) against clinical isolates of bacteroides vulgatus and enterococcus faecalis or the reference strains escherichia coli american type culture collection (atcc) 25922 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923. results: compared with controls and ulcerative colitis there was a reduced antimicrobial effect in crohn's disease extracts that was most evident against b. vulgatus. the antimicrobial effect against e. coli and e. faecalis was significantly lower in crohn's disease compared with ulcerative colitis. activity against s. aureus disclosed a similar pattern, but was less pronounced. the differences were independent of the inflammation status or concurrent steroid treatment. bacteria  incubated with biopsy extracts from ulcerative colitis patients frequently showed a characteristic change in cell size and granularity, compatible with more extensive membrane disintegration, compared with bacteria incubated with extracts from controls or crohn's disease. conclusion: crohn's disease of the colon is characterized by a diminished functional antimicrobial activity that is consistent with the reported low antibacterial peptide expression.

TI  == daptomycin antimicrobial activity tested against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated in european medical centers (2005).
AB  == background: daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide with potent activity and broad spectrum against gram-positive bacteria currently used for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections and bacteremia, including right sided endocarditis. we evaluated the in vitro activity of this compound and selected comparator agents tested against clinical strains of staphylococci and enterococci collected in european medical centers in 2005. methods: a total of 4,640 strains from 23 medical centers located in 10 european countries, turkey and israel (sentry program platform) were tested for susceptibility by reference  broth microdilution methods according to clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines and interpretative criteria. mueller-hinton broth was supplemented to 50 mg/l ca++ for testing daptomycin. results for oxacillin (methicillin)-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci were analyzed separately. results: oxacillin resistance rates among staphylococcus aureus varied from 2.1% in sweden to 42.5% in the united kingdom (uk) and 54.7% in ireland (29.1% overall), while vancomycin resistance rates varied from 0.0% in france, sweden and switzerland to 66.7% in the uk and 71.4% in ireland among enterococcus faecium (17.9% overall). all s. aureus strains were inhibited at daptomycin mic of 1 mg/l (mic50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and only one coagulase-negative staphylococci strain (0.1%) showed an elevated (>1 mg/l) daptomycin mic value (4 mg/l). among e. faecalis (mic50/90, 0.5/1 mg/l; 100% susceptible) the highest daptomycin mic value was 2 mg/l; while among e. faecium  (mic50/90, 2/4 mg/l; 100% susceptible) the highest mic result was 4 mg/l. conclusion: daptomycin showed excellent in vitro activity against staphylococci and enterococci collected in european medical centers in 2005 and resistance to oxacillin, vancomycin or quinupristin/dalfopristin did not compromise its activity overall against these pathogens. based on these results and those of previous publications, daptomycin appears to be an excellent therapeutic option for serious infections caused by oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci in europe.

TI  == reversal of resistance in microorganisms by help of non-antibiotics.
AB  == intracellular efflux pumps have been largely the research focus in multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms and parasites including cancers. however, drug efflux mechanisms other than pumps per se have been observed, supported by the effects of isomeric, non-antibiotic depressant (dpr), phenothiazines and thixenes, and antidepressant (adpr) phenylpiperidine neurotropic drugs, alone or in combination with classical antimicrobials on mdr staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. of the non-antibiotics we investigated, the dpr l-thioridazine, trans-clopenthixol and isomers of phenylpiperidines nnc 20-4962 (isomer of femoxetine) and nnc 20-7052 (isomer of paroxetine) were potent antimicrobials with the least neurotropic activity, pointing to a possible general isomeric structure-activity  relationship. these compounds may be regarded as new efflux inhibitors. moreover, these isomers have considerably reduced, in some cases absent, neurotropism and reduced mammalian toxicity. this may alleviate concerns about adverse effects and therapeutic safety for infected patients in life-threatening situations where the non-antibiotic dosage would be in the lower, non-chronic dosage ranges generally  prescribed for individuals with mild mental health problems. the results point to the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms' phospholipid/protein domain involvement of the cationic, amphiphilic, non-antibiotic dpr and adpr, with the phospholipids being the initial sites attracting and concentrating the neurotropes to induce a form of suspended animation, followed by gross changes of cell wall and membrane structure, and thereby potentiating their destructive or immobilizing effects on various as yet only hinted at resistance and efflux mechanisms. combination of appropriate isomeric non-antibiotic dpr and adpr of low neurotropism and toxicity with conventional and classical antimicrobials promises early, new therapeutic strategies salutary against microbial resistance, resistance development, pathogenicity and virulence.

TI  == the enterococcus faecalis mscramm ace binds its ligand by the collagen hug model.
AB  == we have determined the crystal structure of the ligand binding segment of the enterococcus faecalis collagen binding mscramm ace (microbial surface components  recognizing adhesive matrix molecules adhesin of collagen from enterococci). this segment is composed of two subdomains, n(1) and n(2), each adopting an igg-like fold and forming a putative collagen binding surface at the interface between the two subdomains. this structure is very similar to that recently reported for cna, the collagen binding mscramm of staphylococcus aureus, for which a unique ligand  binding mechanism called the collagen hug was proposed. we suggest that ace binds collagen by a similar mechanism and present the first biochemical evidence for this binding model. replacing residues in the putative collagen binding trench of ace n(2) with ala residues affected collagen binding. a closed conformation of ace stabilized by an engineered disulfide bond is unable to bind collagen. finally, the importance of the residues in the n(2) extension in stabilizing the  mscramm-ligand complex is demonstrated by selected point and truncation mutations.

AB  == classic antisense rna research has focused on detailed examination of a few plasmid-encoded systems whilst more recent efforts have focused on chromosomally  encoded small rnas. recent work on newly identified plasmid-encoded antisense rnas suggest that there is still much to learn from them about the versatility of regulatory rnas. the alpha-proteobacterial repabc plasmids produce an antisense rna that regulates the replication initiator independently of the partition proteins encoded in the same operon. the staphylococcus aureus plasmid psk41 produces an antisense rna that regulates the replication initiator protein by a translational attenuation mechanism. enterococcus faecalis pheromone-responsive plasmids produce plasmid-specific variants of an antisense rna that regulates conjugation structural genes by a transcriptional attenuation mechanism. e. faecalis plasmid pad1 encodes an antisense rna-regulated addiction module that combines features of classic plasmid-encoded and trans-regulated chromosomally encoded antisense systems. studies on these systems will expand our understanding of the repertoire of small rna regulators.

TI  == anti-mrsa beta-lactams in development, with a focus on ceftobiprole: the first anti-mrsa beta-lactam to demonstrate clinical efficacy.
AB  == ceftobiprole is the first of the investigational beta-lactam antibiotics with in  vitro activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci to reach and complete  phase iii therapeutic trials. its antibacterial spectrum includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant streptococci and many gram-negative pathogens. it has demonstrated in vivo activity against many experimental infections caused by these pathogens. ceftobiprole has completed phase iii clinical trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections, is being studied in phase iii pneumonia trials and has demonstrated non-inferiority compared with vancomycin in a phase iii complicated skin and skin structure infections trial, resulting in >  90% clinical cures of infections caused by mrsa. other anti-mrsa beta-lactams in  therapeutic clinical trials include the carbapenem cs-023/ro-4908463 and the cephalosporin ceftaroline (ppi-0903). the future of all of these agents will depend on their clinical efficacy, safety and their ability to be accepted as beta-lactams for the reliable treatment of a broad spectrum of infections, including those caused by mrsa.

TI  == antibacterial effect of autologous platelet gel enriched with growth factors and  other active substances: an in vitro study.
AB  == platelet-rich plasma is a new inductive therapy which is being increasingly used  for the treatment of the complications of bone healing, such as infection and nonunion. the activator for platelet-rich plasma is a mixture of thrombin and calcium chloride which produces a platelet-rich gel. we analysed the antibacterial effect of platelet-rich gel in vitro by using the platelet-rich plasma samples of 20 volunteers. in vitro laboratory susceptibility to platelet-rich gel was determined by the kirby-bauer disc-diffusion method. baseline antimicrobial activity was assessed by measuring the zones of inhibition on agar plates coated with selected bacterial strains. zones of inhibition produced by platelet-rich gel ranged between 6 mm and 24 mm (mean 9.83 mm) in diameter. platelet-rich gel inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus and was also active against escherichia coli. there was no activity against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. moreover, platelet-rich gel seemed to induce the in vitro growth of ps. aeruginosa, suggesting that it may cause an exacerbation of infections with this organism. we believe that a combination of the inductive and antimicrobial properties of platelet-rich gel can improve the treatment of infected delayed healing and nonunion.

TI  == coniothyrione, a chlorocyclopentandienylbenzopyrone as a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor discovered by antisense technology.
AB  == bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors interact mainly with rrna and to some extent ribosomal proteins, which are potential targets for developing new antibacterial agents. specifically, the ribosomal protein s4 of the 30s ribosomal subunit known as ribosomal protein small-subunit d (rpsd) may be useful as a target. the antisense-rpsd gene-sensitized two-plate assay led to the discovery of a novel chlorinated cyclopentandienylbenzopyrone antibiotic, coniothyrione, c14h9clo6, isolated from coniothyrium cerealis mf7209. it exhibited liquid mics of 16-32 microg/ml against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, haemophilus  influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis and >64 microg/ml against escherichia coli. isolation, structure elucidation, and antibacterial activity of coniothyrione are described.

TI  == treatment of vegetable sauces with enterocin as-48 alone or in combination with phenolic compounds to inhibit proliferation of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of enterocin as-48 against staphylococcus aureus was tested in vegetable sauces, alone and in combination with phenolic compounds. when added alone at 25 microg/ml, as-48 inactivated all detectable staphylococci  in napoletana and pesto sauces stored at 22 degrees c, but it only caused limited growth inhibition when these sauces were stored at 10 degrees c, as well as in other sauces such as carbonara and green sauce for fish. at 80 microg/ml, as-48 eliminated all detectable staphylococci in napoletana, pesto, and green sauce for fish regardless of storage temperature, but it still had much more limited effect in carbonara sauce. antistaphylococcal activity was potentiated significantly when as-48 was used in combination with the phenolic compounds carvacrol, geraniol, eugenol, terpineol, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, citral, and hydrocinnamic acid. the efficacy of the combined treatments depended both on the  phenolic compound and the type of sauce. in carbonara sauce stored at 22 degrees  c, the combinations of 80 microg/ml as-48 and 20 mm hydrocinnamic acid or 126 mm  carvacrol reduced viable counts of staphylococci below detection limits for up to 30 days.

TI  == potent, synergistic inhibition of staphylococcus aureus upon exposure to a combination of the endopeptidase lysostaphin and the cationic peptide ranalexin.
AB  == objectives: successful treatment of infections involving multiply drug-resistant  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is becoming increasingly difficult. in this work, we have investigated the potential of combining lysostaphin with cationic antimicrobial peptides to effectively inhibit staphylococcus aureus. methods: s. aureus strains were grown in 96-well plates in the presence of increasing concentrations of lysostaphin and the peptides ranalexin, dermaseptin s3(1-16) or magainin 2. growth was determined visually after 48 h and the plates imaged, or by automated optical density readings in a plate reader. susceptibility to the combination of lysostaphin and ranalexin was  also determined by viable cell counts. the efficacy of combined lysostaphin and ranalexin on a solid surface was tested via disc diffusion assays. results and conclusions: combination of lysostaphin with ranalexin resulted in potent, synergistic inhibition of s. aureus mssa476 and mrsa252. synergistic inhibition was specific for lysostaphin-susceptible staphylococci and was not observed with  clinical isolates of the gram-negative escherichia coli, or other gram-positive organisms, such as enterococcus faecalis. lysostaphin was not specifically synergistic with ranalexin alone. synergy was also observed with two other cationic antimicrobial peptides, magainin 2 and dermaseptin s3(1-16); although combination with ranalexin was most potent. synergistic inhibition by ranalexin in combination with lysostaphin resulted in an enhanced bactericidal effect. importantly, synergy between lysostaphin and ranalexin was also observed after impregnation and drying in filter paper discs that clearly inhibited growth of s. aureus on the surface of agar; a solid, porous matrix. thus, the combination could represent a novel route to target wounds infected with drug-resistant mrsa  via dressings impregnated with the two compounds.

TI  == semisynthetic approaches to laspartomycin analogues.
AB  == laspartomycin c (1), a lipopeptide antibiotic related to amphomycin, consists of  a cyclic peptide core and an aspartic acid unit external to the core and linking  this to a c15-2,3-unsaturated fatty acid. this was reported initially to be active against staphylococcus aureus, and more recent studies have shown that it  is active against vre, visa, and mrsa isolates. the enzymatic cleavage of the fatty acid tail was accomplished with a deacylase produced by actinoplanes utahensis and resulted in two peptides, designated peptide 1 and peptide 2. semisynthetic derivatives of both peptides have been made, and the principal requirement for biological activity appears to be the presence of an acylaspartic acid.

TI  == characterization of macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci from colombian hospitals: a countrywide surveillance.
AB  == objective: the characterization of macrolide resistance in gram-positive cocci recovered from colombian hospitals. methods: the resistance profiles and mechanism of macrolide resistance were investigated in isolates of streptococcus  pneumoniae (1679), staphylococcus aureus (348), coagulase-negative staphylococci  (cons) (175), and enterococcus spp (123). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for erythromycin (ery) and clindamycin (cli), detection of macrolide resistance genes, phenotypic characterization, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of macrolide-resistant pneumococci were performed. results: resistance to ery and cli was 3.3% and 2.3% for s. pneumoniae, 58% and 57% for s. aureus (94% for both compounds in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)), and 78.6% and 60.7% in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively. ery resistance was 62% in enterococcus faecalis and 82% in enterococcus faecium. the mls(b)-type accounted for 71% of s. pneumoniae and 100% of mrsa. the erm(a) gene was prevalent in mrsa, erm(b) in s. pneumoniae  and enterococci, and erm(c) in cons isolates. efflux pump genes (mef(a) genes) were mostly identified in s. pneumoniae (24%). the most common genotype amongst ery-resistant pneumococci was the spain(6b)-2 clone. conclusions: the prevalence  of macrolide resistance is low in colombian pneumococci and high in mrsa (cmls(b)-type).

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

AB  == notification of bacterial meningitis (bm) is likely to be incomplete, and a recent danish study indicated that unbalanced notification may bias expected aetiology of bm. therefore the danish bacterial meningitis group initiated a national registration of culture-positive bm. methods: laboratory data on all bacterial isolates from cerebrospinal fluid deemed to be clinically relevant were identified on a national basis during 2002 and 2003. bacterial findings were compared to cases notified during the same period. results: a total of 404 bm cases were identified. the distribution of bacterial species differed from the national notification data during the same period especially with respect to staphylococcus aureus (6.7% vs. 0.6%), escherichia coli (3.5% vs. 0%) and non-streptococcus pneumoniae streptococci (10% vs. 1.9%). the overall notification-rate was 66%, and was below 20% for s. aureus, e. coli, enterococcus faecalis, non-s. pneumoniae streptococci and for 13 cases of "other bacteria". sensitivity to antibiotics in the bm cases was as expected for northern europe. reduced sensitivity to penicillin was found in 2/202 s. pneumoniae, in 2/10 listeria monocytogenes, and 21/27 s. aureus were penicillin resistant. e. coli was resistant to ampicillin in 5 of 13 cases and to gentamicin in 1 of 11 cases.  discussion: a suboptimal notification rate with an unbalanced species distribution was found. laboratory based data thus constitute an improved basis for future recommendations for empirical treatment of bm. a continued national collaboration may promote the development of quality indicators for diagnosis and initial treatment of bm.

TI  == role of bacterial and host factors in infectious endophthalmitis.
AB  == endophthalmitis is a frequent blinding complication of globe-penetrating injury and ocular surgery. the outcome of this intraocular infection depends both on the organism involved and management of the ensuing inflammation. the role of various toxins and bacterial factors in the pathogenesis of this infection is beginning to be delineated, but appears to be organism specific. because of the immune-privileged environment of the eye, principles important in the resolution  of infection at extraocular sites cannot be extrapolated to understanding the host-parasite dynamics in eye infection. moreover, some factors that suppress the intraocular immune environment appear to have unexpected roles in activating phagocytic cells of the innate immune system in response to the presence of bacteria. therefore, considerable additional information characterizing the precise role of bacterial and host factors in the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis will be required in order to develop new therapies to improve the outcome of this often blinding infection.

AB  == the genotypic and phenotypic variability of 40 lactococcus lactis isolates obtained from three cheese-making trials of batzos cheese made one in each, winter, spring and summer was investigated. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling and pfge  were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among strains. according  to pfge data, all strains except one were clustered together (at a similarity level of approximately 50%) with the l. lactis subsp. lactis reference strain and eleven groups of isolates consisting of 2-8 strains each were distinguished. plasmid profiling results revealed that there were eight isolates lacking plasmids and nine having unique plasmids. twenty-three isolates were allocated into six groups. there was an interesting similarity between the plasmid profiling groups and those formed according to pfge. clustering of strains according to rapd-pcr was in agreement with results obtained by both plasmid profiling and pfge for the majority of the strains. in addition, results obtained by molecular methods indicate a grouping of most of the strains according to the  season of cheese production. all strains inhibited the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7. their ability to affect the growth of yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus faecalis was strain dependent. in 42.5% of the isolates high acidifying ability in milk after 24 h was recorded and these were isolates, mainly, from fresh cheese. the 75% of the isolates from winter cheese exhibited higher lys- than leu-aminopeptidase activity while the approximately 67% of the isolates from summer cheese showed higher leu- than lys-aminopeptidase activity. their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for 24 h was significant with preference for alpha(s)-casein degradation. the majority (90%) of the strains formed methanethiol from methionine and this ability was strain dependent. these  results suggest that among the wild lactococcal population from batzos cheese there are interesting strains appropriate to be used as starters for the dairy industry.

TI  == catheter associated infections in hemodialysis patients.
AB  == hemodialysis catheter related infections (hcri) are one of the major causes of increasing mortality, morbidity and cost of therapy in hemodialysis patients. prevention of hcri requires the identification of predisposing risk factors. to determine the frequency of hcri risk factors, we studied 116 patients (54% male,  mean age of 49.5+/-16 years) patients with hcri between 2003-2004. forty one percent of the patients were diabetic. there was a history of previous catheter placement and infection in 41% and 32% of patients, respectively. pathogenic organisms isolated from blood cultures included staphylococcus-aureus 42%, coagulase-negative staphylococci 20%, e. coli 19%, enterococci 7%, streptococcus  d 7%, pseudomonas aeruginosa 4%, and klebsiella 1%. bacterial resistance to vancomycin and amikacin was present in 7% and 4% of the cases, respectively. hemodialysis catheter related blood borne infections comprised 67% of the total blood-borne infections in our hospital. no significant statistical association was found between hcri and age, gender, diabetes mellitus, serum albumin level <30 g/l, leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anatomical location of  catheter, mean duration of antibiotic therapy, mean catheter duration, frequency  of hemodialysis sessions, pathogenic organisms, and history of previous catheter  infection. we conclude that the prevalence of pathogenic organisms of hcri were similar to previous studies. however, bacterial resistance to antibiotics was low. the mean duration of catheter usage was longer than previously reported.

TI  == histidine-rich glycoprotein exerts antibacterial activity.
AB  == histidine-rich glycoprotein (hrgp), an abundant heparin-binding protein found in  plasma and thrombocytes, exerts antibacterial effects against gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa). fluorescence studies and  electron microscopy to assess membrane permeation showed that hrgp induces lysis  of e. faecalisbacteria in the presence of zn2+ or at low ph. heparin blocked binding of the protein to e. faecalis and abolished antibacterial activity. furthermore, truncated hrgp, devoid of the heparin-binding and histidine-rich domain, was not antibacterial. it has previously been shown that peptides containing consensus heparin-binding sequences (cardin and weintraub motifs) are  antibacterial. thus, the peptide (ghhph)4, derived from the histidine-rich region of hrgp and containing such a heparin-binding motif, was antibacterial for e. faecalis in the presence of zn2+ or at low ph. the results show a previously undisclosed antibacterial activity of hrgp and suggest that the histidine-rich and heparin-binding domain of hrgp mediates the antibacterial activity of the protein.

TI  == a review of the current place of glycopeptides in turkish medical practice.
AB  == background: glycopeptide antibiotics are considered by many investigators to be the last resort in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections. objective: the aim of this review was to assess the place of glycopeptides in the treatment of common gram-positive bacteria in accordance with the current epidemiologic data in turkey. methods: a search of both the english- and turkish-language literature indexed on medline, ulakbim (turkey), and pleksus (turkey) was performed using the terms: vancomycin, teicoplanin, and glycopeptides, or their turkish-language counterparts. the complete texts of the  articles found in these databases were obtained from the electronic library of gulhane medical academy, ankara, turkey. articles from regional journals, without the support of an electronic format, were obtained by direct communication. articles of interest were those based on studies occurring in turkish populations, with special consideration given to publications in press after 2002. results: staphylococci were the most frequent gram-positive pathogens encountered in turkish hospitals. studies have found that approximately 74% of strains were staphylococcus aureus and the remaining strains were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons). overall methicillin resistance in staphylococci was reported as approximately 60%. in turkey, s aureus was one of the most common infectious agents found inside hospitals and is deemed a growing  threat in the community. while the rate of methicillin resistance in community-acquired isolates is approximately 4%, the data from hospitals suggest  that reduced resistance comprises most of the isolates. in the studies reviewed,  older quinolones like ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin seem to be ineffective in nearly half of the s aureus isolates. alternatives like rifampicin, gentamicin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (tmp/smx), clindamycin, and erythromycin have had substantial resistance profiles in >50% of the strains. in  recent turkish studies, in vitro profiles of linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin (qd), and daptomycin have had positive results. as in the s aureus isolates, resistance trends have been observed in the cons group of pathogens. the possible use of beta-lactams seems restricted, and alternative approaches have become necessary. quinolones, gentamicin, tetracycline, tmp/smx, clindamycin, and erythromycin have resistance profiles of >50%. although glycopeptide resistance was not detected, the frequency of heterogenous vancomycin-intermediate s aureus, a precursor to future resistance, was 13% in 1 study. current studies in turkey have found that enterococcus faecalis comprises three quarters of enterococci while the rest are comprised of enterococcus faecium. initial studies performed with linezolid, qd, and daptomycin suggest that these drugs might be effective alternatives for future enterococcal infections that may have high glycopeptide resistance. approximately 8% of the streptococcus pneumoniae strains had high-level resistance in turkey. however, 10 million units of crystallized penicillin or 3 g of oral amoxicillin maintains the optimum treatment of pneumococcal infections outside the central nervous system (cns). resistance profiles in third-generation cephalosporins in turkey range between 2% and 2.5%.  conclusions: in turkey, a review of the existing literature found that the current use of glycopeptides in pneumococcal infections is restricted to cns infections facing therapeutic failure in due course. however, the belief that these drugs are the last resort, either in staphylococcal or enterococcal infections, is no longer valid. if a patient has a critical status due to probable gram-positive microorganisms, clinicians should consider the empiric use of glycopeptides. however, new molecules such as linezolid, qd, and daptomycin, offered for use in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial diseases, should be reserved for the future, when glycopeptides eventually become obsolete.

AB  == the antibacterial activities of 31 different beta-, mixed alpha/beta-, and gamma-peptides, as well as of beta-peptides derived from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids were assayed against six pathogens (enterococcus  faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the results were compared with literature data. the interaction of these peptides with mammalian cells, as  modeled by measuring the hemolysis of human erythrocytes, was also investigated.  in addition to those peptides designed to fold into amphiphilic helical conformations with positive charges on one face of the helix, one new peptide with hemolytic activity was detected within the sample set. moreover, it was demonstrated that neither cationic peptides used for membrane translocation (beta3-oligoarginines), nor mixed alpha/beta- or gamma-peptides with somatostatin-mimicking activities display unwanted hemolytic activity.

AB  == the antimicrobial activities of crude dichloromethane fractions from acetone extracts of agrobacterium rhizogenes transformed roots and roots of field-grown plants of salvia sclarea as well as four pure abietane diterpenoids isolated from the hairy root cultures were determined. the growth of gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis) but not gram-negative ones (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa) or pathogenic fungi (candida albicans) was inhibited by fractions tested at concentrations of 37.5-75.0 microgml(-1). abietane diterpenoids: salvipisone, aethiopinone, 1-oxoaethiopinone and ferruginol were shown to be bacteriostatic as well as bacteriocidal for the cultures of s. aureus and s. epidermidis strains, regardless of their antibiotic susceptibility profile. this was demonstrated by using simultaneously the optical density measuring method and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide-reduction assay. the highest activity was shown by salvipisone which demonstrated also a very interesting activity when its effect on 24-h-old staphylococcal biofilm cells viability was examined. it limited the survival of biofilms formed by s. aureus as well as by s. epidermidis, putting this compound to the list of potential anti-biofilm agents, better than most of known antibiotics.

TI  == effect of solar radiation on survival of indicator bacteria in bathing waters.
AB  == sunlight exposure is considered to be the most important cause of "natural disinfection" in surface water environments. the uv-b portion of the solar spectrum is the most bactericidal, causing direct (photo-biological) dna damage.  in the present experimental study, the effect of solar radiation on the elimination of bacteria in water, especially in surface water, was studied. the influence of depth and uv-b transmittance of water was determined. comparing escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis proved to be the most resistant organism. pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be the most sensitive indicator bacterium among the tested microorganisms. results show a significant correlation between radiation intensity and reduction rates. best elimination of microorganisms occurs on the water surface; with increasing water depth, there is less uv radiation to inactivate bacteria. high turbidity substantially reduces uv-b transmittance in water causing decreased elimination efficiency. the results of the present study show that sunlight, given an appropriate intensity and good  water transparency is suitable to inactivate fecal indicator bacteria within a few hours in surface waters and therefore also in bathing waters.

TI  == in-vitro activity of triclosan-eluting ureteral stents against common bacterial uropathogens.
AB  == background and purpose: ureteral stents are commonly used in urology today, but the biofilms that form on them within hours of placement may harbor bacteria that can result in infection or encrustation. triclosan is an antimicrobial commonly used in consumer and medical products that inhibits bacterial fatty-acid synthesis. the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect of a triclosan-eluting ureteral stent was tested against clinical isolates of common bacterial uropathogens in an in-vitro setting. materials and methods: triclosan eluted from a drug-loaded ureteral stent was suspended in artificial urine with bacterial pathogens (escherichia coli c1214, proteus mirabilis 296, enterococcus faecalis 1131, klebsiella pneumoniae 280, staphylococcus aureus newman, pseudomonas aeruginosa ak1) to assess growth, virulence-promoter activity, and bacterial adherence to the stent. generic stents were utilized as controls. results: triclosan inhibited the growth of e. faecalis, k. pneumoniae, s. aureus, and p. mirabilis in a dose-dependent manner. pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance. lower concentrations of triclosan downregulated e. coli virulence-factor promoters of outer membrane protein x and p-fimbriae. triclosan  stents had significantly fewer adherent viable bacteria than control stents. conclusions: triclosan-eluting ureteral stents inhibit the growth of common bacterial uropathogens and thus may reduce the incidence of urinary-tract infections and, potentially, encrustation. this drug-eluting stent provides both  mechanical drainage of the upper urinary tract and local antibiosis.

TI  == structure-antimicrobial activity relationship for silanols, a new class of disinfectants, compared with alcohols and phenols.
AB  == triorganosilanols (r(ch(3))(2)sioh) were recently reported to exhibit unexpectedly strong disinfectant properties. the antimicrobial activities of silanols were significantly higher than their analogous alcohols. a study of the  structural dependence of their antimicrobial activity was conducted against four  bacteria, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. silanols, alcohols with structures analogous to the silanols (r(ch(3))(2)coh) and substituted phenols were evaluated as a single class of materials. the minimum lethal concentrations (mlcs), defined as the concentration required for a 7-log reduction in viable bacteria after 1h exposure, were used to measure antimicrobial activity. octanol-water partition coefficients (logp) and hydrogen bond acidities (deltanu), measured as the shift  in frequency of the oh stretching band between free oh and hydrogen-bonded oh to  diethyl ether oxygen by infrared spectroscopy, were utilised as dispersive and polar structural parameters, respectively. the correlation established by multiple regression analysis between antimicrobial activities and structural properties of silanols, alcohols and phenols against the four bacteria treated as a single family produced the following equation, log(1/mlc)=0.679 logp+0.0036deltanu-1.909 (n=282, r=0.96, s=0.22). this equation and the significantly high correlation coefficient supported the hypothesis that the lipophilic properties and the h-bond acidities are primary factors for the antimicrobial action of silanols, alcohols and phenols. the high antimicrobial activity of silanols is explained by their greater h-bond acidity and their enhanced lipophilicity.

TI  == a new series of glycopeptide antibiotics incorporating a squaric acid moiety. synthesis, structural and antibacterial studies.
AB  == the aglycones of the antibiotics eremomycin, vancomycin and ristocetin (3, 4 and  6, respectively) were prepared by deglycosidation of the parent antibiotics with  hydrogen fluoride, and complete assignation of their 1h, 13c and 15n spectra was  performed. the squaric acid amide esters (11-14), were prepared from dimethyl squarate. the corresponding asymmetric diamides (16-19, 22, 23) were also synthesized using 4-phenylbenzylamine and triglycine. the advantage of the method is the high regioselectivity and that no protecting group strategy is required. electrospray mass spectroscopic method was elaborated for the determination of the site of substitution of the modified antibiotics. the antibacterial activity  of the prepared compounds is discussed in detail.

TI  == appropriateness of empiric gentamicin and vancomycin therapy for bacteremias in chronic dialysis outpatient units in the era of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == bacteremias in inpatient chronic hd units have been described, but there is little information on bacteremias in ambulatory hd units. to determine the frequency of bacteremia and pathogen distribution in ambulatory chronic hd units, we retrospectively reviewed our experience with 107 bacteremias in 5 chronic ambulatory hd units over a 3 year period. the object of the study was twofold. the first objective was to determine if bacteremias in ambulatory hd setting were substantially different in frequency or type than in the inpatient hd setting. secondly, febrile patients suspected of having bacteremia in chronic hd patients  are often empirically treated with vancomycin and gentamicin. chronic hd patients require repeated and frequent venous access for hd. bacteremias are common in chronic hd patients and may be primary or secondary and are often related to venous access site infections. the distributions of bacteremia pathogens in chronic hd patients are predominantly reflective of skin flora, i.e., staphylococci and to lesser extent aerobic gram-negative bacilli. after s. aureus (msra/mssa) and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons), enterococci are the next most important gram-positive pathogens in bacteremic hd patients. most strains of e. faecalis are sensitive to vancomycin and for practical purposes should be considered as vancomycin sensitive enterococci (vse). in contrast, most strains of e. faecium are resistant to vancomycin and should be considered as vancomycin resistant enterococci (vre). we retrospectively reviewed 107 patients  on chronic ambulatory hd to determine the adequacy of empiric vancomycin and gentamicin prophylaxis. we found amikacin is preferred to gentamicin and that meropenem is an effective alternate substitution for gentamicin and vancomycin combination therapy.

TI  == dual targeting of gyrb and pare by a novel aminobenzimidazole class of antibacterial compounds.
AB  == a structure-guided drug design approach was used to optimize a novel series of aminobenzimidazoles that inhibit the essential atpase activities of bacterial dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv and that show potent activities against a variety of  bacterial pathogens. two such compounds, vrt-125853 and vrt-752586, were characterized for their target specificities and preferences in bacteria. in metabolite incorporation assays, vrt-125853 inhibited both dna and rna synthesis  but had little effect on protein synthesis. both compounds inhibited the maintenance of negative supercoils in plasmid dna in escherichia coli at the mic. sequencing of dna corresponding to the gyrb and pare atp-binding regions in vrt-125853- and vrt-752586-resistant mutants revealed that their primary target in staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae was gyrb, whereas in streptococcus pneumoniae it was pare. in enterococcus faecalis, the primary target of vrt-125853 was pare, whereas for vrt-752586 it was gyrb. dna transformation experiments with h. influenzae and s. aureus proved that the mutations observed in gyrb resulted in decreased susceptibilities to both compounds. novobiocin resistance-conferring mutations in s. aureus, h. influenzae, and s. pneumoniae were found in gyrb, and these mutants showed little or no cross-resistance to vrt-125853 or vrt-752586 and vice versa. furthermore, gyrb and pare double mutations increased the mics of vrt-125853 and vrt-752586 significantly, providing evidence of dual targeting. spontaneous frequencies of resistance to vrt-752586 were below detectable levels (<5.2x10(-10)) for wild-type e. faecalis but were significantly elevated for strains containing single and double target-based mutations, demonstrating that dual targeting confers low levels of resistance emergence and the maintenance of susceptibility  in vitro.

TI  == monotherapy versus combination therapy.
AB  == the science of antibiotic therapy for infectious diseases continues to evolve. in many instances where empiric coverage is necessary, treatment with more than one  agent is considered prudent. if an etiology is identified, antibiotics are modified based on culture and susceptibility data. even when the organism is known, more than one antibiotic may be needed. decisions about antibiotics should be made after assessments of pertinent clinical information, laboratory and microbiology information, ease of administration, patient compliance, potential adverse effects, cost, and available evidence supporting various treatment options. clinicians also need to consider synergy and local resistance patterns in selecting therapeutic options. in this article, the authors outline monotherapy and combination therapy options for several common infectious diseases.

TI  == topical ethyl chloride fine spray. does it have any antimicrobial activity?
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to assess whether ethyl chloride fine spray (cryogesic) has antimicrobial activity. material and methods: blood agar plates supplemented with 5% horse blood were inoculated with five different organisms, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis. the plates were assessed for growth inhibition at 24 and 48 h by the microbiologist and compared with the non-sprayed control plates. results: the model showed a highly significant (p<0.0001) reduction in bacterial  count for the plates treated with fine ethyl chloride spray. the estimate of the  percentage of bacteria remaining after spraying with ethyl chloride was 42.7%, with a 95% confidence interval of 35.9-50.9%. there was no evidence that the effect of ethyl chloride fine spray was different for the different organisms (p=0.49). conclusion: the use of ethyl chloride shows bacterial count reduction but the clinical implication of this needs to be determined. the authors postulate that any statistically significant reduction can only be helpful in reducing the infection rates. this coupled with the already proven local anaesthetic effects of ethyl chloride will make it an important tool for procedures like arthrocentesis and venepunctures.

TI  == high-level vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates associated with a  polymicrobial biofilm.
AB  == glycopeptides such as vancomycin are the treatment of choice for infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. this study describes the identification of high-level vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa) isolates in a  polymicrobial biofilm within an indwelling nephrostomy tube in a patient in new york. s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, micrococcus species, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from the biofilm. for vrsa isolates, vancomycin mics ranged from 32 to >128 microg/ml. vrsa isolates were also resistant to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, penicillin, and tetracycline but remained susceptible to chloramphenicol, linezolid, rifampin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. the vana gene was localized to a plasmid of approximately 100 kb in vrsa and e. faecium isolates from the biofilm. plasmid analysis revealed that the vrsa isolate acquired the 100-kb e. faecium plasmid, which was then maintained without integration into the mrsa plasmid. the tetracycline resistance genes tet(u) and tet(s), not previously detected in s. aureus isolates, were identified in the vrsa isolates. additional resistance elements in the vrsa isolate included a multiresistance gene cluster, ermb-aade-sat4-apha-3, msra (macrolide efflux), and the bifunctional aminoglycoside resistance gene aac(6')-aph(2")-ia. multiple combinations of resistance genes among the various isolates of staphylococci and  enterococci, including vana, tet(s), and tet(u), illustrate the dynamic nature of gene acquisition and loss within and between bacterial species throughout the course of infection. the potential for interspecies transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes, including resistance to vancomycin, may be enhanced by the microenvironment of a biofilm.

TI  == sensitive quantitative detection of commensal bacteria by rrna-targeted reverse transcription-pcr.
AB  == a sensitive rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) method was developed for exact and sensitive enumeration of subdominant bacterial populations. using group- or species-specific primers for 16s or 23s rrna, analytical curves were constructed for escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the threshold cycle value was found to be linear up to an rna amount of 10(-3) cell per rt-pcr. the number of bacteria in culture was determined by rt-qpcr, and the results correlated well with the cfu count over the range from 10(0) to 10(5) cfu. the bacterial counts obtained by rt-qpcr were the same as the cfu counts irrespective of the growth phase in vitro, except for c. perfringens during starvation periods; the viable cell counts obtained by using a combination of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (dapi) staining and syto9-propidium iodide double staining were in good agreement with the rt-qpcr counts rather than with the cfu  counts. the rt-qpcr method could detect endogenous enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa in feces of hospitalized patients (n = 38) at a level of 10(3) cells per g of feces, and for enumeration of s. aureus or p. aeruginosa spiked into human peripheral blood, the lower detection limit for rt-qpcr quantification of the bacteria was 2 cells per ml of blood, suggesting that this method was equivalent to the conventional culture method. as only 5 h was needed for rt-qpcr quantification, we suggest that rrna-targeted rt-qpcr assays provide a sensitive  and convenient system for quantification of commensal bacteria and for examining  their possible invasion of a host.

TI  == serum bactericidal activities of high-dose daptomycin with and without coadministration of gentamicin against isolates of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus species.

AB  == in order to evaluate the applicability of six primer and probe sets for taqman real-time rcr on dna of wastewater samples, effects of the sample matrix and dna  background on target quantification were studied with respect to differences between functional genes and taxonomically used rdna targets. primer/probe assays for real-time pcr (taqman) designed to quantitatively detect the antibiotic resistance genes bla(vim), vana, ampc, meca, and taxon-specific 23s rdna sequences for pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecium/faecalis were tested for their sensitivity and amplification robustness. the amplification of their gene targets in dna extracts of wastewater ("wastewater dna") and reference strains ("reference dna") was compared with their amplification in "model dna" which was composed of wastewater dna and reference dna. target detection was quantifiable along up to seven decimal orders of magnitude. for the detection of  the resistance genes bla(vim), vana, ampc, and meca as well as the enterococci directed pcr only weak or no inhibition due to the impurities or wastewater dna matrix were demonstrated for the applied target concentrations. the taxonomically applied detection system for the quantification of p. aeruginosa showed a limited performance. for the analysis of the amplification dynamics of possibly similar nucleotide sequences of organisms related to p. aeruginosa a sybr green assay was employed. competitive amplification of similar sequences was identified to be a major mechanism of reduced sensitivity. hence, the primers were modified for an optimised detection. with the resulting reduction of cross reactions an increased sensitivity was achieved for the detection and quantification of p. aeruginosa in wastewater dna.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  == treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. it is active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. the aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella ozaenae, enterobacter cloacae and proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers  and non-producers). gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic bacteroides fragilis. ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs). killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the  first few hours of the kinetic curves against e. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) reduction in the first 2h), b. fragilis (4 log(10) cfu reduction in 4h), mssa (3 log(10) cfu reduction in 4-6h), k. ozaenae (esbl+), k. pneumoniae (esbl+ and -), e. cloacae (esbl-) in 1h and p. mirabilis (esbl+) in the first 2h. the potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of e. coli-b. fragilis and e. coli-b. fragilis-e. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of s. aureus-p. mirabilis. these results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.

TI  == comparative stability and growth requirements of s. aureus and faecal indicator bacteria in seawater.
AB  == the fate (stability, multiplication) of s. aureus, e. coli and e. faecalis was determined in three classes of recreational waters (seawater, estuarine, stream)  supplemented with nutrients in the form of sewage and peptone. in the absence of  sunlight (24 +/- 2 degrees c), all bacteria in all water samples did not multiply and were slowly (days) inactivated. when 50% sewage was added to all water samples, e. coli and e. faecalis multiplied but s. aureus did not. when peptone (0.05%, 0.5%) was the added nutrient, the three bacteria multiplied. in the presence of sunlight (15-27 degrees c), s. aureus was inactivated rapidly (hours) in all water samples. these results show that when their nutritional requirements are met, s. aureus, e. coli and e. faecalis can multiply in the high salinity conditions of seawater. however, under environmental conditions, sunlight is an effective natural bactericidal agent.

TI  == [towards new antibacterial drugs. interest of para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene].
AB  == we present here the results concerning the antibacterial properties evaluation of para-guanidinoethylcalix[4]arene, compared with its constitutive monomer, the para-guanidinoethylphenol, and hexamidine (hexomedine), an antiseptic from the diamidine family widely used in therapeutic, chosen as a reference in this study  for its resemblance in terms of functional groups. antibacterial activities of those three compounds were evaluated by microdilution methods, in mueller hinton  broth, onto 5 bacterial strains: escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 & atcc 29213 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, according to ca-sfm and clsi (formerly nccls) approved standards. in parallel, the effects of these three compounds on mrc-5 eukaryotic cell viability were evaluated with mtt assay. the results obtained here confirm a lack of activity for the monomer compound (mic> or =512 mg/l) and  a real antibacterial activity for the calixarene, comparable to hexamidine. this  activity is expressed, both on gram+and gram- bacteria (mic=4 mg/l for e. coli, 8 mg/l on both s. aureus strains) and at a lesser degree on e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa (mic=32 mg/l). similarly, both compounds, monomer and calixarene, slightly induce any modification on mrc-5 cells viability, and this until 168 h of treatment for concentrations reaching 10(-4) mol/l while hexamidine demonstrates a significant and increasing effect during the time of experiment and this for 100 to 1000 times lower concentrations. thus, this study tends to confirm the significance of the organization of the para-guanidinoethylphenol monomer into its cyclic calixarenic tetramer for the gain of an antibacterial activity, similar to a widely used antiseptic one.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine against  selected single-species biofilms.
AB  == aim: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 2.5% and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and 2.0% chlorhexidine gel and liquid as endodontic-irrigating substances against selected single-species biofilms. methods: single-species biofilms of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis and fusobacterium nucleatum were generated on a cellulose nitrate membrane placed on  agar medium. the biofilms were then immersed in the endodontic-irrigating substances for 30 s and also for 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min, with and without mechanical agitation. sterile saline was used as control. after each time period, the membrane filters were then transferred to tubes containing 2 ml of fresh broth medium plus neutralizers (in order to prevent the residual action of the tested substances). the micro-organisms were suspended using a vortex, and the inoculum was serially diluted 10-fold. aliquots of the dilutions were plated on 5% sheep blood agar medium, and incubated under adequate gaseous conditions. colony-forming units were calculated. the samples were compared using the friedman and tukey test, when necessary, at a significance level of p < 0.05. results: mechanical agitation promoted the effectiveness of the antimicrobial agents, resulting in less time to eliminate the same micro-organisms, except for  s. aureus with 2.5% naocl. antimicrobial agents in liquid presentation, especially 5.25% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine, killed the tested micro-organisms more rapidly. saline did not inhibit the growth of any of the tested micro-organisms, with or without agitation, being statistically different (p < 0.05) from naocl and chlorhexidine. p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, p. endodontalis and f. nucleatum were eliminated in 30 s by all antimicrobial agents, with our without agitation, in contrast with the facultative and aerobe strains. conclusions: mechanical agitation improved the antimicrobial properties of the chemical substances tested using a biofilm model, favouring the agents in liquid  presentation, especially 5.25% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine.

TI  == topoisomerase mutations and efflux are associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == to understand better the mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance in enterococcus faecalis, fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants isolated from ent. faecalis atcc 29212 by stepwise selection with sparfloxacin (spx) and norfloxacin (nor) were analysed. the results showed the following. (i) in general, fluoroquinolone-resistance mechanisms in ent. faecalis are similar to those in other gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae, namely, mutants with amino acid changes in both gyra and parc exhibited high fluoroquinolone resistance, and single gyra mutants and a single parc mutant were more resistant to spx and nor, respectively, than the parent strain, indicating that the primary targets of spx and nor in ent. faecalis are dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv, respectively. (ii) alterations in gyrb (deltakga, residues 395-397) and pare (glu-459 to lys) were associated with fluoroquinolone resistance in some mutants. moreover, the facts that the nor mic, but not the spx mic, decreased in the presence of multidrug efflux pump inhibitors, that nor accumulation decreased in the cells, and that the emea mrna  expression level did not change, strongly suggested that a nora-like efflux pump, rather than emea, was involved in resistance to nor.

AB  == a series of pyrazolidine-3,5-dione and 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-one inhibitors  of escherichia coli udp-n-acetylenolpyruvyl glucosamine reductase (murb) has been prepared. the 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-ones show low micromolar ic(50) values versus e. coli murb and submicromolar minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) against staphylococcus aureus gc 1131, enterococcus faecalis gc 2242, streptococcus pneumoniae gc 1894, and e. coli gc 4560 imp, a strain with increased outer membrane permeability. none of these compounds show antimicrobial activity against candida albicans, a marker of eukaryotic toxicity. moreover, these compounds inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis, as assessed by measuring the  amount of soluble peptidoglycan produced by streptococcus epidermidis upon incubation with compounds. a partial least squares projection to latent structures analysis shows that improving murb potency and mic values correlate with increasing lipophilicity of the c-4 substituent of the 5-hydroxy-1h-pyrazol-3(2h)-one core. docking studies using flo and pharmdock produced several binding orientations for these molecules in the murb active site.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide combined with chlorhexidine gel used as intracanal medicament.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide (ca(oh)2) combined with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (chx) gel against endodontic pathogens and to compare the results with the ones achieved by ca(oh)2 mixed with sterile water and by chx gel alone. two methods were used: the agar diffusion test and the direct contact test. ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel produced inhibitory zones ranging from 2.84 to 6.5 mm, and required from 30 seconds to 6 hours to eliminate all tested microorganisms. however, 2% chx gel showed the largest microbial growth zones from 4.33 to 21.67 mm, and required 1 minute or less to inhibit all tested microorganisms. a paste of ca(oh)2 plus sterile water  inhibited only the microorganisms with which it was in direct contact and required from 30 seconds to 24 hours to kill all tested microorganisms. in conclusion, 2% chx gel + ca(oh)2 showed better antimicrobial activity than ca(oh)2 manipulated with sterile water.

TI  == multiple bacterial species reside in chronic wounds: a longitudinal study.
AB  == the aim of the study was to investigate the bacterial profile of chronic venous leg ulcers and the importance of the profile to ulcer development. patients with  persisting venous leg ulcers were included and followed for 8 weeks. every second week, ulcer samples were collected and the bacterial species present were identified. more than one bacterial species were detected in all the ulcers. the  most common bacteria found were staphylococcus aureus (found in 93.5% of the ulcers), enterococcus faecalis (71.7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (52.2%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (45.7%), proteus species (41.3%) and anaerobic bacteria (39.1%). resident bacterial species were present in all the ulcers. in 76% of the ulcers, two or more (up to five) resident bacterial species were found. the most common resident bacterial species were s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. furthermore, ulcers with p. aeruginosa were found to be significantly larger than ulcers without the presence of p. aeruginosa (p < 0.005). our study demonstrated that the chronic wound is colonised by multiple bacterial species and that once they are established many of them persist in the wound. our results suggest that the presence of p. aeruginosa in venous leg ulcers can induce ulcer  enlargement and/or cause delayed healing.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in the southeastern mediterranean--preliminary results from the armed project.
AB  == sporadic reports from centres in the south and east of the mediterranean have suggested that the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in this region appears to  be considerable, yet pan-regional studies using comparable methodology have been  lacking in the past. susceptibility test results from invasive isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium and faecalis routinely recovered from clinical samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid within participating laboratories situated in algeria, cyprus, egypt, jordan, lebanon, malta, morocco, tunisia and turkey were collected as part of the armed project. preliminary data from the first two years of the project showed the prevalence of penicillin non-susceptibility in s. pneumoniae to range from 0% (malta) to 36% (algeria) [median: 29%] whilst methicillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus varied from 10% in lebanon to 65% in jordan [median: 43%]. significant country specific resistance in e. coli was also seen,  with 72% of isolates from egyptian hospitals reported to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins and 40% non-susceptible to fluoroquinolones in turkey.  vancomycin non-susceptibility was only reported in 0.9% of e. faecalis isolates from turkey and in 3.8% of e. faecium isolates from cyprus. the preliminary results from the armed project appear to support previous sporadic reports suggesting high antibiotic resistance in the mediterranean region. they suggest that this is particularly the case in the eastern mediterranean region where resistance in s. aureus and e. coli seems to be higher than that reported in the  other countries of the mediterranean.

TI  == c-terminal wxl domain mediates cell wall binding in enterococcus faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == analysis of the genome sequence of enterococcus faecalis clinical isolate v583 revealed novel genes encoding surface proteins. twenty-seven of these proteins, annotated as having unknown functions, possess a putative n-terminal signal peptide and a conserved c-terminal region characterized by a novel conserved domain designated wxl. proteins having similar characteristics were also detected in other low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria. we hypothesized that the wxl region might be a determinant of bacterial cell location. this hypothesis was tested by generating protein fusions between the c-terminal regions of two wxl proteins in e. faecalis and a nuclease reporter protein. we demonstrated that the c-terminal regions of both proteins conferred a cell surface localization to the  reporter fusions in e. faecalis. this localization was eliminated by introducing  specific deletions into the domains. interestingly, exogenously added protein fusions displayed binding to whole cells of various gram-positive bacteria. we also showed that the peptidoglycan was a binding ligand for wxl domain attachment to the cell surface and that neither proteins nor carbohydrates were necessary for binding. based on our findings, we propose that the wxl region is a novel cell wall binding domain in e. faecalis and other gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == 1h nmr spectroscopy in the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  == the (1)h nmr spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (uti). k. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd), acetate, ethanol and succinate. the quantity of 1,3-pd produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. other common bacteria causing uti (except for citrobacter frundii), such as escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), enterobacter  aerogenes, acinetobacter baumanii, proteus mirabilis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus gp b and staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. citrobacter frundii (c. frundii) also gives the same nmr results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary  tract infection. the method provides a single-step documentation of k. pneumoniae (and c. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of uti was obtained in 516 cases (84%). the nmr-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. in the present authors' experience, the results of nmr spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

AB  == ceftobiprole medocaril [bal 5788, ro 65-5788, jnj 30982081] is a prodrug in phase iii clinical development with basilea pharmaceutica and cilag ag (johnson & johnson) for the potential treatment of serious bacterial infections, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). ceftobiprole medocaril is the water-soluble prodrug of the pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, ceftobiprole [bal 9141, ro 63-9141]. because of the low water solubility of ceftobiprole, its clinical application was limited and basilea began its investigations into ceftobiprole medocaril for further development. ceftobiprole medocaril is being developed for  iv administration and is currently undergoing phase iii trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections (including mrsa) and hospital-acquired (nosocomial) pneumonia. ceftobiprole medocaril has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive bacteria (including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria. ceftobiprole medocaril inhibits all transpeptidases, including the penicillin-binding protein (pbp) 2a, by a unique combination of features. pbp 2a  is the primary enzyme responsible for beta-lactam drug resistance in mrsa; pbp 2a also acts as a key defense mechanism by interacting with the bacterial cell wall  to form a chemical barricade that is impervious to antibiotics. ceftobiprole medocaril has been designed specifically to bind to this penicillin-resistant target. ceftobiprole medocaril is bactericidal and has not shown resistance development in vitro or in stringent animal models. studies conducted by basilea  have demonstrated that ceftobiprole medocaril is readily converted to ceftobiprole, and shows markedly improved water solubility. in february 2005, basilea pharmaceutica ag entered into an exclusive worldwide agreement with cilag ag international (johnson & johnson) to develop, manufacture and market ceftobiprole medocaril. ortho-mcneil pharmaceutical (johnson & johnson) will market ceftobiprole medocaril in the us, and its affiliate companies, known as janssen-cilag, will market the product outside the us (entered as world in the licensee table). basilea has retained an option to co-promote ceftobiprole medocaril in the us, major european countries, japan and china. johnson & johnson pharmaceutical research and development llc will develop ceftobiprole medocaril in collaboration with basilea. roche previously retained an opt-in right on ceftobiprole medocaril. however, following roche's decision not to exercise this  right in may 2004, basilea gained full global commercialisation rights for ceftobiprole medocaril. roche retains its major shareholding in basilea. ceftobiprole medocaril is currently in phase iii trials for complicated skin and  skin structure infections due to mrsa, and nosocomial pneumonia (including ventilator-associated pneumonia) due to suspected or proven mrsa, and community-acquired pneumonia. the us fda has granted fast-track status to the compound for these two indications. phase iii results are expected in 2006 and an nda is expected to be submitted to the fda in 2007. an additional pivotal phase iii trial (strauss 2, study of resistant staphyloccocus aureus in skin and skin structure infections) of ceftobiprole medocaril was initiated in october 2005 for complicated skin infections, including diabetic foot infections. this trial will  be conducted in conjunction with johnson & johnson pharmaceutical research and development.

AB  == the bacterial strains isolated from 490 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 14 institutions in japan were collected between august 2004 and july 2005. the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were measured. of them, 577 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the measurement. the strains consisted of 156 gram-positive bacterial strains (27.0%) and 421 gram-negative bacterial strains (73.0%). against staphylococcus aureus, arbekacin (abk), vancomycin (vcm) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/ml. against enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (abpc) and vcm showed a strong antibacterial activity. the antibacterial activity of cephems to escherichia coli was generally good, and especially cefozopran (czop) and cefpirome (cpr) showed the strongest activity (mic90: < or = 125 microg/ml). quinolone resistant e. coli [mic of ciprofloxacin (cpfx): > or = 4 microg/ml] was detected at frequency of 18.8%, which was higher than that in the last year. against klebsiella pneumoniae, czop, meropenem (mepm), and carumonam (crmn) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/ml or less. the antibacterial activity of the other cephems was relatively good, and decrease in their activity observed in the last year study was not recognized. against serratia marcescens, imipenem (ipm) and gentamicin (gm) had the strongest antibacterial activity. against proteus mirabilis, crmn showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/ml or less. mepm prevented the growth of all strains with 0.25 microg/ml. next, cefmenoxime (cmx), ceftazidime (caz), czop, cefixime (cfix), cefpodoxime (cpdx), and cefditoren (cdtr) showed a strong activity. the antibacterial activity of the drugs to pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and mic90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to > 128 microg/ml except ipm and mepm having 16 microg/ml. the antibacterial activities of czop and caz were considered to be relatively good on mic50 comparison (mic50: 2 microg/ml).

TI  == pyrrolidine bis-cyclic guanidines with antimicrobial activity against drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens identified from a mixture-based combinatorial library.
AB  == the rapid rise in antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections prompted us to explore the development of novel strategies for synthesis of large chemical libraries amenable to high-throughput screening for antimicrobial activities. here we report the solid-phase synthesis of a 738,192 member pyrrolidine bis-cyclic guanidine chemical library with 26 different amino acids at three positions of diversity and 42 carboxylic acids at the fourth position. this synthetic combinatorial library was developed for positional scanning and screened for bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities against the important human pathogen methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). the eight compound mixtures exhibiting bactericidal activity (10 microg/ml) against mrsa were used to direct the synthesis of 36 individual compounds that were then screened for activity against mrsa, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), and two gram-negative bacterial species. at least 20 individual compounds  were bactericidal for mrsa at 2.5 microg/ml, with a subset of these compounds showing bactericidal activities (10 microg/ml) against the other species tested.  this approach demonstrates the capability to synthesize and screen a complex library to yield promising antimicrobials that address a critical need for novel  infectious disease therapeutics.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive bacteria isolated from european medical centres: results of the daptomycin surveillance programme (2002-2004).
AB  == the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of 9322 contemporary (2002-2004) gram-positive bacterial isolates collected from 31 medical centres in 14 countries in europe were evaluated by broth microdilution methods according to clsi guidelines. the isolates collected comprised staphylococcus aureus (4842 isolates), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons; 1942 isolates), enterococcus faecalis (1147 isolates), enterococcus faecium (391 isolates), beta-haemolytic streptococci (660 isolates) and viridans group streptococci (340 isolates). the organisms were tested against daptomycin and more than 20 comparator agents in mueller-hinton broth, supplemented with calcium to 50 mg/l when testing daptomycin. overall, methicillin (oxacillin) resistance rates were 26.7% and 77.0% for s. aureus (mrsa) and cons, respectively, and the vancomycin resistance  rate among enterococci was 6.1%. mrsa rates varied from 0.6% in sweden to 40.2-43.0% in belgium, greece, ireland, the uk and israel, and vre rates varied from 0% in switzerland to 21.2% in ireland. more than 99.9% of isolates tested were considered susceptible to daptomycin according to breakpoints established by the united states food and drug administration and the clsi. daptomycin was active against all gram-positive species, with the highest mic being 2, 8, 0.5 and 2 mg/l for staphylococci, enterococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci and viridans group streptococci, respectively. daptomycin activity was not influenced adversely by resistance to other agents among staphylococci or enterococci. this  novel lipopeptide (daptomycin) appears to be an excellent alternative therapeutic option for serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive organisms isolated in europe.

TI  == [preventing nosocomial infections. dressings soaked in polyhexamethylene biguanide (phmb)].
AB  == polyhexamethlene biguanide (phmb) is an antibacterial agent included in the chlorhexidine group which is active against a wide number of microorganisms including staphylococcus aureus methycilin resistant (mrsa), vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre) and acinetobacter baumannii which all cause antibiotic-resistant infections. traditionally gauze dressings have been used to  cover and protect wounds although their porous structure does not constitute an efficient barrier against bacterial penetration, especially when a dressing becomes wet due to the effects of a wound oozing and draining. recently the use of a dressing soaked in a 0.2% phmb solution which works as a biological barrier  against pathogenic agents has been introduced in clinical practice. on the one hand, this phmb soaked dressing inhibits bacterial growth in the areas where it is applied and, on the other hand, it prevents the penetration of microorganisms  through the dressing itself. simultaneously while a phmb soaked dressing carries  out these actions, it creates an environment favorable to the proliferation of the normal flora found in the epidermis. as opposed to porous gauze dressings, a  phmb dressing remains active during 72 hours even in wet environs. its wide anti-micro-bacterial range prevents infections in surgical, acute or chronic wounds and in any type of intra-corporal access susceptible to infection, such as by means of intravascular catheters, tracheotomies, or thoracic tubes. a phmb dressing can also be used as a primary covering to treat a chronic wound since it does not interfere in the process of tissue reepithelization.

TI  == microbial drug efflux proteins of the major facilitator superfamily.
AB  == drug efflux proteins are widespread amongst microorganisms, including pathogens.  they can contribute to both natural insensitivity to antibiotics and to emerging  antibiotic resistance and so are potential targets for the development of new antibacterial drugs. the design of such drugs would be greatly facilitated by knowledge of the structures of these transport proteins, which are poorly understood, because of the difficulties of obtaining crystals of quality. we describe a structural genomics approach for the amplified expression, purification and characterisation of prokaryotic drug efflux proteins of the 'major facilitator superfamily' (mfs) of transport proteins from helicobacter pylori, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus  subtilis, brucella melitensis, campylobacter jejuni, neisseria meningitides and streptomyces coelicolor. the h. pylori putative drug resistance protein, hp1092,  and the s. aureus qaca proteins are used as detailed examples. this strategy is an important step towards reproducible production of transport proteins for the screening of drug binding and for optimisation of crystallisation conditions to enable subsequent structure determination.

TI  == automated detection and quantitation of bacterial rna by using electrical microarrays.
AB  == low-density electrical 16s rrna specific oligonucleotide microarrays and an automated analysis system have been developed for the identification and quantitation of pathogens. the pathogens are escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis, which are typically involved in urinary tract infections. interdigitated gold array electrodes (ida-electrodes), which have structures in the nanometer range, have been used for very sensitive analysis. thiol-modified oligonucleotides are immobilized on the gold ida as capture probes. they mediate  the specific recognition of the target 16s rrna by hybridization. additionally three unlabeled oligonucleotides are hybridized in close proximity to the capturing site. they are supporting molecules, because they improve the rna hybridization at the capturing site. a biotin labeled detector oligonucleotide is also allowed to hybridize to the captured rna sequence. the biotin labels enable  the binding of avidin alkaline phophatase conjugates. the phosphatase liberates the electrochemical mediator p-aminophenol from its electrically inactive phosphate derivative. the electrical signals were generated by amperometric redox cycling and detected by a unique multipotentiostat. the read out signals of the microarray are position specific current and change over time in proportion to the analyte concentration. if two additional biotins are introduced into the affinity binding complex via the supporting oligonucleotides, the sensitivity of  the assays increase more than 60%. the limit of detection of escherichia coli total rna has been determined to be 0.5 ng/microl. the control of fluidics for variable assay formats as well as the multichannel electrical read out and data handling have all been fully automated. the fast and easy procedure does not require any amplification of the targeted nucleic acids by pcr.

TI  == coenzyme q10 production in recombinant escherichia coli strains engineered with a heterologous decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene and foreign mevalonate pathway.
AB  == in the present work, escherichia coli dh5alpha was metabolically engineered for coq(10) production by the introduction of decaprenyl diphosphate synthase gene (ddsa) from agrobacterium tumefaciens. grown in 2ytg medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% nacl, and 0.5% glycerol) with an initial ph of 7, the recombinant e. coli was capable of coq(10) production up to 470 microg/gdcw (dry  cell weight). this value could be further elevated to 900 microg/gdcw simply by increasing the initial culture ph from 7 to 9. supplementation of 4-hydroxy benzoate did not improve the productivity any further. however, engineering of a  lower mevalonate semi-pathway so as to increase the isopentenyl diphosphate (ipp) supply of the recombinant strain using exogenous mevalonate efficiently increased the coq(10) production. lower mevalonate semi-pathways of staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and saccharomyces cerevisiae were tested. among these, the pathway of streptococcus pneumoniae proved to be superior, yielding coq(10) production of 2,700+/-115 microg/gdcw when supplemented with exogenous mevalonate of 3 mm. in order to construct a complete mevalonate pathway, the upper semi-pathway of the same bacterium, streptococcus pneumoniae, was recruited. in a recombinant e. coli dh5alpha harboring three plasmids encoding for upper and lower mevalonate semi-pathways as well as ddsa enzyme, the heterologous mevalonate pathway could convert endogenous acetyl-coa to ipp, resulting in coq(10) production of up to 2,428+/-75 microg/gdcw, without mevalonate supplementation. in contrast, a whole  mevalonate pathway constructed in a single operon was found to be less efficient. however, it provided coq(10) production of up to 1,706+/-86 microg/gdcw, which was roughly 1.9 times higher than that obtained by ddsa alone.

TI  == assessment of two commercial susceptibility test methods for determination of daptomycin mics.
AB  == daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against several important gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including drug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. because the mechanism of action of daptomycin is calcium-dependent depolarization of the cell membrane, susceptibility testing requires medium supplemented with a physiological level of calcium. this study assessed two food  and drug administration-cleared commercial test devices for determination of daptomycin mics, etest and justone. a collection of 220 selected isolates, including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, e. avium, e. durans, e. casseliflavus, and e. gallinarum, were tested by both methods. included in the collection were 22 s. aureus and 14  enterococcus sp. isolates that were recovered from patients and were nonsusceptible on the basis of the daptomycin mics. as the reference method for comparison, all isolates were tested by the clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution method incorporating cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth with 50 microg/ml calcium. daptomycin mics agreed, within 1 twofold dilution, for 97% of the isolates by etest and for 100% by justone. however, daptomycin mics determined by etest were 1 dilution lower than the reference mics for 65% of the enterococcus sp. isolates tested. this resulted in 28.5% very major (vm) errors (4/14) with enterococci (all e. faecium) but none (0/22) with staphylococci. use of justone yielded mics that were 1 dilution lower than the reference mics for 69% of the staphylococci and 25% of the enterococci. this resulted in 13.6% vm errors (3/22) with staphylococci and 14.3% vm errors (2/14)  with enterococci. the manufacturer-recommended justone inoculum preparation resulted in mean colony counts of only 5 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(5) cfu/ml in the wells of the strip. increasing the inoculum to 3 x 10(5) to 4 x 10(5) cfu/ml eliminated two of five vm errors upon retesting. no major interpretive errors occurred with  either device. in summary, daptomycin mics generated by the etest or justone method generally agreed within 1 dilution of the reference daptomycin mics. however, both devices produced slightly lower mics that resulted in some vm errors.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria are common causes of bloodstream and other infections in hospitalized patients in the united states, and the percentage of nosocomial bloodstream infections caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria is increasing. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) are of particular concern. in the united states, approximately 60% of staphylococcal infections in the intensive care unit are now caused by mrsa, and percentages continue to rise. outbreaks of hospital-acquired mrsa (ha-mrsa) are typically the result of clonal spread by mrsa being transferred from patient to patient, frequently using healthcare personnel as intermediaries. ha-mrsa strains are generally multidrug resistant. vancomycin is the standard treatment for serious mrsa infections, but a few cases of vancomycin-resistant s aureus (vrsa) have recently emerged in the united states. community-acquired mrsa (ca-mrsa) is also increasing. soft tissue infections are the most frequent presentations of ca-mrsa, but life-threatening invasive infections occur as well, including necrotizing pneumonia. the mechanisms of methicillin resistance are the same for ca-mrsa and ha-mrsa, but susceptibilities to non-beta-lactam antibiotics often differ. ca-mrsa exhibits broader antibiotic susceptibility than does ha-mrsa. the proportion of enterococci resistant to vancomycin continues to rise in the hospital setting, with the overwhelming majority of infections due to enterococcus faecium. clonal  spread of vre has been documented, but polyclonal outbreaks associated with antimicrobial use are also common. the relations between antibiotic use and vre colonization are complex and related to the antienterococcal activity, biliary excretion, and antianaerobic activity of the antibiotic. recent results show a decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (ipd) since the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and suggest that, where available, vaccines may be useful in the battle to slow the spread of resistant gram-positive cocci.

TI  == [antibiotic-resistance in italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project ar-iss].
AB  == the antibiotic resistance surveillance project ar-iss, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country.  the laboratories collect and transmit data to the istituto superiore di sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis/faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed escherichia coli. they also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study earss-italia and from other european countries. oxacillin resistance in s. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in europe (41,5%). no strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. in s. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several european countries. unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in e. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in europe. presumptive esbl production in gram-negative organisms can be  estimated at 20% in klebsiella and 1% in e. coli. ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in e. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in europe. in conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. although some activities of ar-iss  need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and  representative data about antibiotic resistance in italy that can be used for comparison at the european level.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of saponins from medicago sp.: structure-activity relationship.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of saponins from medicago sativa, m. arborea and m. arabica against a selection of medically important yeasts, gram-positive and -negative bacteria was investigated. structure-activity growth inhibitory effects of related prosapogenins and sapogenins are also described. increasing antibiotic activity was observed going from the saponin extracts to the sapogenin samples, suggesting that the sugar moiety is not important for the antimicrobial efficacy. activity was especially high against gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, b.  subtilis, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) with m. arabica being  the species showing a broader spectrum of action. discrete antifungal activity was also observed, mainly against saccharomyces cerevisiae. the observed antimicrobial properties of m. sativa and m. arborea were related to the content  of medicagenic acid, while hederagenin seems to contribute to the bioactivity of  m. arabica total sapogenins.

TI  == predominance of gram-negative bacilli and increasing antimicrobial resistance in  nosocomial bloodstream infections at a university hospital in southern taiwan, 1996-2003.
AB  == background and purpose: while nosocomial infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, the availability of timely and accurate epidemiological information on nosocomial pathogens is essential to the appropriate selection of  empirical therapy. this study analyzed nosocomial bloodstream infections (nbsis)  surveillance data to determine trends in the distribution of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these pathogens. methods: during the period from 1996 to 2003 at national cheng kung university hospital, patients with nbsis were enrolled in the study, and the ranking of pathogens and status of antimicrobial resistance were determined. results: from 1996 to 2003, there were  4,038 episodes of nbsis. the overall incidence was 1.79 episodes per 1,000 inpatient-days. aerobic gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci, fungi, and anaerobes were responsible for 51%, 37%, 10%, and 1.6% of nbsis, respectively. the 5 leading pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16% of nbsis), staphylococcus aureus (13%), candida spp. (10%), acinetobacter baumannii (8%), and escherichia coli (8%). oxacillin resistance was found in 90% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 75% of s. aureus isolates. in contrast to enterococcus faecalis, in which only 1% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 78% of enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to ampicillin. the emerging antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative pathogens included multidrug-resistant a. baumannii, cephalosporin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli. despite the annual increase in the use of fluconazole, candida albicans (54%) remained the most common causative pathogen of nosocomial candidemia. conclusions: in summary, gram-negative bacilli predominated among pathogens causing nbsis and an upsurge in the threat of antimicrobial resistance in our hospital occurred during the 8-year period. surveillance of the characteristics of nbsis and antimicrobial resistance patterns, together with appropriate antibiotic and infection control measures, should be reinforced.

AB  == history and admission findings: we report the case of a 68-year-old female patient who was admitted to the hospital with deranged blood sugar levels in a septic condition. due to complex chronic ulcerations of both feet she was intended for major amputation of both limbs. clinical findings on admission were  a diabetic foot syndrome with stage d iv ulcerations according to the wagner and  armstrong classification, partially visible tendons and phlegmon of the lower leg. investigations and clinical course: vascular diagnostic revealed arterial occlusive disease in the lower legs without chance of reconstruction. enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus were extracted in swabs from ulcers. after correction of metabolic status and antibiotic treatment radical debridement of all ulcers was carried out and vacuum assisted closure therapy (v.a.c.) was initiated. all wounds showed good granulation tissue after four cycles of v.a.c.-therapy. interdisciplinary treatment with a plastic surgeon was  initiated to accelerate epithelial closure. using the "buried skin chip" technique in combination with v.a.c.-therapy epithelialisation was completed within four weeks. the patient recovered well and was fully independent on discharge. discussion and conclusion: a goal-oriented interdisciplinary setting can achieve preservation of extremities even in septic patients. the combination  of buried skin chip grafts and v.a.c.-therapy may be a feasible and promising procedure to achieve accelerated wound closure in those patients.

TI  == impact of enterococcus faecalis on the bactericidal activities of arbekacin, daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in a mixed-pathogen pharmacodynamic model.
AB  == we inoculated an in vitro pharmacodynamic model simultaneously with clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and an enterocin-producing enterococcus (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin susceptible) at 7 log10 cfu/ml to examine enterocin effects and antimicrobial activity on staphylococci. the investigated antimicrobial regimens  were 100 mg arbekacin every 12 h (q12h), 6 mg daptomycin per kg of body weight/day, 600 mg linezolid q12h, and 100 mg tigecycline q24h alone and in combination (daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline) with arbekacin. simulations  were performed in triplicate; bacterial quantification occurred over 48 h, and development of resistance was evaluated throughout. when we evaluated the impact  of antimicrobial activity against s. aureus alone, daptomycin demonstrated bactericidal activity (>or=3 log10 cfu/ml kill), whereas arbekacin, linezolid, and tigecycline displayed bacteriostatic activities (<3 log10 cfu/ml kill). in the mixed-pathogen model, early and distinctive stunting of s. aureus growth was  noted (1.5 log cfu/ml difference) in the presence of enterocin-producing e. faecalis compared to growth controls run individually (p=0.02). most noteworthy was that in the presence of enterocin-producing e. faecalis, bactericidal activity was observed with arbekacin and tigecycline and with the addition of arbekacin to linezolid. antagonism was noted for the combination of tigecycline and arbekacin against s. aureus in the presence of enterocin-producing e. faecalis. our research demonstrates that the inhibitory effect of e. faecalis contributed significantly to its overall antimicrobial impact on s. aureus. this  contribution was enhanced or improved compared to the activity of each antimicrobial alone. further research is warranted to determine the impact of polymicrobial infections on antimicrobial activity.

TI  == in vitro characterization of the antibacterial spectrum of novel bacterial type ii topoisomerase inhibitors of the aminobenzimidazole class.
AB  == antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action are becoming increasingly important in the battle against bacterial resistance to all currently used classes of antibiotics. bacterial dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv (topoiv) are the familiar  targets of fluoroquinolone and coumarin antibiotics. here we present the characterization of two members of a new class of synthetic bacterial topoii atpase inhibitors: vrt-125853 and vrt-752586. these aminobenzimidazole compounds  were potent inhibitors of both dna gyrase and topoiv and had excellent antibacterial activities against a wide spectrum of problematic pathogens responsible for both nosocomial and community-acquired infections, including staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, and mycobacteria. consistent with the novelty of their structures and mechanisms of action, antibacterial potency was unaffected by commonly encountered resistance phenotypes, including fluoroquinolone resistance. in time-kill assays, vrt-125853 and vrt-752586 were bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and haemophilus influenzae, causing 3-log reductions in viable cells within 24 h. finally, similar to the fluoroquinolones, relatively low frequencies of spontaneous resistance to vrt-125853 and vrt-752586 were found, a property consistent with their in vitro dual-targeting activities.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, lbm415, tested against respiratory tract and cutaneous infection pathogens: a global surveillance report (2003-2004).
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the spectrum of activity and potency of lbm415, the first of the peptide deformylase inhibitor (pdfi) class to be developed for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (ussti), against a large, contemporary international collection of targeted pathogens collected during 2003-2004. methods: a total of  21,636 isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution methods as part of a longitudinal international antimicrobial resistance surveillance study. characteristics of the organism collection included resistance to oxacillin among 35.0% of staphylococcus aureus and 76.0% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons); resistance to penicillin (mic > or = 2 mg/l) among 18.0% of streptococcus pneumoniae; vancomycin resistance among 20.0% of enterococcus spp. and ampicillin resistance among 22.0% of haemophilus influenzae. results: lbm415 displayed potent activity against staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus faecium and moraxella catarrhalis, with > or = 99.0% of strains being inhibited at < or = 4 mg/l; 97.0% of enterococcus faecalis isolates and 92.0% of h. influenzae isolates were also inhibited at this concentration. seventy-seven percent of burkholderia  cepacia and 82.0% of stenotrophomonas maltophilia were inhibited at < or = 8 mg/l. no differences in lbm415 activity against s. aureus, cons, s. pneumoniae, enterococcus spp. and h. influenzae were detected for subsets susceptible or resistant to antimicrobials such as oxacillin, penicillin, ampicillin, macrolides, vancomycin and fluoroquinolones. while regional differences were apparent with some comparator agents, sensitivity to lbm415 did not vary significantly among strains from the various geographic areas sampled. one isolate of s. aureus displayed high-level resistance to lbm415 owing to multiple  sequence changes in resistance phenotype genes (defb and fmt), despite the absence of the compound in clinical practice. this isolate remained susceptible to all other antimicrobials tested except for penicillin. conclusions: with few differences detected among strains from various geographic regions, the first pdfi class agent to enter clinical development has consistently demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against commonly isolated pathogens associated with uncomplicated respiratory and cutaneous infections. these compounds represent a significant therapeutic advance owing to their novel mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum, including activity against resistant organisms, should pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters support their continued development. given the detection of a pre-existing pdfi-resistant isolate of s. aureus as demonstrated here, surveillance for resistance among the pdfi-targeted  pathogens following introduction of this class of agent into clinical usage will  be an important component of future studies.

TI  == promotion of opsonization by antibodies and phagocytosis of gram-positive bacteria by a bifunctional polyacrylamide.
AB  == this paper describes the application of a bifunctional polyacrylamide (pa-v-f) presenting both vancomycin and fluorescein groups, to modify the surfaces of multiple species of gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis) to control molecular recognition of these surfaces. the vancomycin groups allowed the specific recognition of a structural component of the bacterial cell wall: peptides terminated in d-ala-d-ala. the fluorescein groups allowed the imaging of binding of polymer to the surfaces of bacteria by fluorescence, and are representative, low molecular weight haptens; their recognition by anti-fluorescein antibodies provides proof-of-principle that bifunctional polymers can be used to introduce haptens onto the surface of the bacteria. flow  cytometry revealed that polymer-labeled s. aureus and s. pneumoniae were opsonized by anti-fluorescein antibodies approximately 20-fold more than were untreated bacteria; nearly all ( approximately 92%) polymer-labeled s. aureus, and a large (76%) fraction of polymer-labeled s. pneumoniae were opsonized. the bound antibodies then promoted phagocytosis of the bacteria by cultured j774 macrophage-like cells. flow cytometry revealed that macrophages ingested s. aureus decorated with the polymer-antibody complexes approximately 2-fold more efficiently than s. aureus in control groups, in spite of the high background (caused by efficient antibody-independent ingestion of s. aureus by macrophages). this paper, thus, demonstrates the ability of a bifunctional polymer to carry out three distinct functions based on polyvalent molecular recognition: (i) recognition of the surface of gram-positive bacteria, (ii) modification of this surface to generate specific binding sites recognized by an antibody, and (iii) promotion of phagocytosis of the opsonized bacteria.

AB  == the bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from 565 patients diagnosed  as urinary tract infections (utis) in 14 institutions in japan were collected between august 2003 and july 2004. the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined. the bacteria were divided into 2 groups consisting of uncomplicated utis and complicated utis (with and without indwelling catheter) based on their isolation origins. the results were compared  with those obtained between 1994 and 2002. the drug sensitivity of s. aureus in this year was similar to those in up to the previous years and s. aureus showed the best susceptibility to vancomycin. the drug sensitivity of e. faecalis in this year also was similar to those in up to the previous years. the drug sensitivity of e. coli in this year was generally good except penicillins and was similar to those in up to the previous years. among cephems, cefozopran (czop) and cefpirome (cpr) showed the highest potency activity (mic90: < or = 0.125 microg/ml). an antibacterial activity of cefotiam (ctm) was stable for 10 years and was fine (mic0: < or = 0.5 microg/ml). the sensitivity of e. coli to carbapenems and carumonam (crmn) also was good like to czop. the sensitivity of the complicated utis group to quinolones, however, has decreased after 2000 and it was suggested that the resistance to the drug has developed. kiebsiella spp. showed a decrease in the susceptibility to some of cephems. the drugs indicating  a big decrease in the sensitivity were cefazolin, ctm, cefaclor, and cefpodoxime. imipenem, carbapenems, also indicated a decrease in the sensitivity. the susceptibility of the strain to the other drugs was similar to that in up to the  previous years. among them, czop maintained good susceptibility (mic90: > or = 0.125 microg/ml against uncomplicated utis, 0.25 microg/ml against complicated utis) like meropenem. the drug sensitivity of p. aeruginosa was generally low and was not much different from that in up to the previous years.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel c12 vinyl ketolides.
AB  == a novel series of c12 vinyl erythromycin derivatives have been discovered which exhibit in vitro and in vivo potency against key respiratory pathogens. the c12 modification involves replacing the natural c12 methyl group in the erythromycin  core with a vinyl group via chemical synthesis. from the c12 vinyl macrolide core, a series of c12 vinyl ketolides was prepared. several compounds were found  to be potent against macrolide-sensitive and -resistant bacteria. the c12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k showed a similar antimicrobial spectrum and comparable activity to the commercial ketolide telithromycin. however, the pharmacokinetic profiles of c12 vinyl ketolides 6j and 6k in rats differ from that of telithromycin by having higher lung-to-plasma ratios, larger volumes of distribution, and longer half-lives. these pharmacokinetic differences have a pharmacodynamic effect as both 6j and 6k exhibited better in vivo efficacy than telithromycin in rat lung infection models against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae.

TI  == beta-nitrostyrene derivatives as potential antibacterial agents: a structure-property-activity relationship study.
AB  == a multidisciplinary project was developed, combining the synthesis of a series of beta-nitrostyrene derivatives and the determination of their physicochemical parameters (redox potentials, partition coefficients), to the evaluation of the corresponding antibacterial activity. a complete conformational analysis was also performed, in order to get relevant structural information. subsequently, a structure-property-activity (spar) approach was applied, through linear regression analysis, aiming at obtaining a putative correlation between the physicochemical parameters of the compounds investigated and their antibacterial  activity (both against standard strains and clinical isolates). the beta-nitrostyrene compounds displayed a lower activity towards all the tested bacteria relative to the beta-methyl-beta-nitrostyrene analogues. this was observed particularly for the 3-hydroxy-4-methoxy-beta-methyl-beta-nitrostyrene (ivb) against the gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium). the spar results revealed the existence of a  clear correlation between the redox potentials and the antibacterial activity of  the series of beta-nitrostyrene derivatives under study.

AB  == the antibacterial working range of six lysozymes was tested under ambient and high pressure, on a panel of five gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, bacillus  subtilis, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus lysodeikticus)  and five gram-negative bacteria (yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium). the lysozymes included two that are commercially available (hen egg white lysozyme or hewl, and mutanolysin from streptomyces globisporus or m1l), and four that were chromatographically purified (bacteriophage lambda lysozyme or lal, bacteriophage t4 lysozyme or t4l, goose egg white lysozyme or gewl, and cauliflower lysozyme or cfl). t4l, lal and gewl were highly pure as evaluated by silver staining of sds-page gels and zymogram analysis while cfl was only partially pure. at ambient pressure each gram-positive test organism displayed a specific pattern of sensitivity to the six lysozymes, but none of the gram-negative bacteria was sensitive to any of the lysozymes. high pressure treatment (130-300 mpa, 25 degrees c, 15 min) sensitised several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria for one or more lysozymes. m. lysodeikticus and p. aeruginosa became sensitive to all lysozymes under high pressure, s. typhimurium remained completely insensitive to all lysozymes, and the other bacteria showed sensitisation to some of the lysozymes. the possible applications of the different lysozymes as biopreservatives, and the possible reasons for the observed differences in bactericidal specificity are discussed.

TI  == microbiologic characterization of isolates from a dalbavancin clinical trial for  catheter-related bloodstream infections.
AB  == dalbavancin, a new-generation semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide in phase 3 clinical  development, has been documented to be more active than vancomycin or teicoplanin against gram-positive bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains, by in vitro testing and in animal models. the human pharmacokinetics of dalbavancin predicts efficacy at weekly dosing intervals. in a phase 2 open-label clinical trial, dalbavancin exhibited superiority when compared with vancomycin against catheter-related bloodstream infection (cr-bsi). the majority of pathogens identified in this study as in clinical practice were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), necessitating rigorous characterization of duplicate isolates to rule out contaminants and to validate cases for study evaluations. at follow-up for the intent-to-treat population, overall pathogen eradication was 92.3% for dalbavancin and 75.9% for vancomycin. we describe the details of organisms isolated, their epidemiologic/genetic characterization, susceptibility  patterns against glycopeptides, and the eradication rates by organism group. in conclusion, dalbavancin was active against all isolated pathogens associated with cr-bsi (cons, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis; all mic results, < or = 0.25 microg/ml) and achieved significant (p < 0.05) clinical success when compared with vancomycin.

TI  == bacterial sepsis and chemokines.
AB  == bacterial sepsis causes a high mortality rate when it occurs in patients with compromised host defenses. severely burned patients, typical immunocompromised hosts, are extremely susceptible to infections from various pathogens, and a local wound infection frequently escalates into sepsis. in these patients, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa are familiar pathogens that cause opportunistic infections. also, polymicrobial sepsis frequently occurs in these patients. in this review, therefore, the roles  of chemokines in thermally injured patients infected with these 3 pathogens and polymicrobial sepsis will be discussed. these infections in thermally injured patients may be controlled immunologically, because immunocompetent hosts are resistant to infections with these pathogens. classically activated macrophages (m1mphi) are major effector cells for host innate immune responses against these  infections. however, m1mphi are not generated in thermally injured patients whose alternatively activated macrophages (m2mphi) predominate. m2mphi appear in patients early after severe burn injuries. m2mphi inhibit m1mphi generation through the secretion of ccl17 and il-10. as a modulator of mphi, two different subsets of neutrophils (pmn-i, pmn-ii) are described. pmn-i direct the polarization of resident mphi into m1mphi through the production of ccl3. m2mphi  are induced from resident mphi by ccl2 released from pmn-ii. therefore, as an inhibitor of ccl2, glycyrrhizin protects individuals infected with s. aureus. sepsis stemming from p. aeruginosa wound infection is also influenced by ccl2 released from immature myeloid cells. a large number of immature myeloid cells appear in association with burn injuries. host resistance to s. aureus, e. faecalis, p. aeruginosa or polymicrobial infections may be improved in thermally  injured patients through the induction of m1mphi, elimination of ccl2 and/or depletion of m2mphi induced by ccl2.

AB  == background: alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against cd52, a cell surface antigen expressed on b and t lymphocytes, monocytes and nk cells.  its use results in a profound decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. we followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in cd4 positive t lymphocytes. patients and methods: fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. however, no patient had bacteremia with streptococcus pneumoniae, listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal salmonella or mycobacterium avium complex. fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. the most common organisms isolated from the blood  were staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative staphylococcus (14 episodes), klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and escherichia coli (7 episodes). discussion: we conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound cd4 positive t lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of cd4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of xrp2868, a new oral streptogramin composed of a combination of rpr132552 (streptogramin a) and rpr202868 (streptogramin b), was evaluated against a collection of clinical gram-positive isolates with characterized phenotypes and genotypes of streptogramin resistance. the effects of genes for resistance to streptogramin a or b on the activity of xrp2868 and its components were also tested by cloning these genes individually or in various combinations in gram-positive recipient strains susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. the species tested included staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, and other species of streptococci. xrp2868 was generally fourfold more potent than quinupristin-dalfopristin against s. aureus,  e. faecium, and streptococci and had activity against e. faecalis (mics = 0.25 to 1 microg/ml). xrp2868 appeared to be affected by the same mechanisms of resistance as those to quinupristin-dalfopristin. nevertheless, the strong activity of factor a of the oral streptogramin enabled the combination to be very potent against streptogramin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and e. faecium (mics = 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml) and to retain low mics against the strains harboring a mechanism of resistance to factor a or factor b of the streptogramin. however, the combination of mechanisms of resistance to factors a  and b caused an increase in the mics of xrp2868, which reached 1 to 4 mug/ml. as  with the other streptogramins, there was a reduction in the bactericidal effect of xrpr2868 when the staphylococcal strains acquired a constitutively expressed erm gene.

TI  == flavonoid analysis and antimicrobial activity of commercially available propolis  products.
AB  == propolis ethanolic solutions are the most used propolis products on the market for the treatment of minor ulcers in the mouth, angina, thrush or skin infections. since it is still an unofficial drug in pharmacy, we analyzed the contents of flavonoids in ten commercially available ethanolic solutions of propolis from the croatian market using two complementary colorimetric methods. antimicrobial activities, determined with the diffusion method, against six bacterial species (bacillus subtilis nctc 8236, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, streptococcus pyogenes atcc 12204, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, escherichia  coli atcc 10536, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, and one yeast-like fungus candida albicans atcc 10231 were compared. results of flavonoids analysis suggested that the contents of flavones and flavonols in the products were uniform and ranged from 0.14 to 0.41%, but the content of flavanones varied greatly from 0.43 to 18.78%. total flavonoid content, as the sum of two colorimetric methods, in propolis products was between 0.78 and 18.92%, and most  products had the flavonoids content below 9%. all products with the total flavonoids content above 1% showed antimicrobial activity against the four gram-positive bacterial species tested, and against p. aeruginosa and the yeast-like fungus c. albicans. total flavonoids contents, expressed as the sum of two colorimetric methods, could be useful methods for estimating the flavonoid contents of propolis products. our results indicate that the quality of commercially available propolis products requires verification.

TI  == a re-emerging class of antimicrobial agents: streptogramins (quinupristin/dalfopristin) in the management of multiresistant gram-positive nosocomial cocci in hospital setting.
AB  == multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, are emerging pathogens in the setting of immunocompromised, hospitalized patients, especially when surgery or invasive procedures are of concern, and patients are admitted in intensive care units. the spectrum of antimicrobial compounds available for an effective treatment of these infection is significantly threatened by the emerging and spread of glycopeptide-resistant strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin is a novel streptogramine association, which represents an effective response to most of these problems, due to its innovative mechanim of action, its maintained activity against multiresistant pathogens, and its possibility of synergistic activity with other compounds. problems related to the epidemiology of multiresistant gram-positive infection, potential clinical indications of quinupristin/dalfopristin, and updated data on efficacy and tolerability of this compound and its derivatives, are outlined on the ground of  a review of available literature evidences.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  == objectives: to examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. methods: models of the catheterized  bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. hplc was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. results: when catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/l) the formation of catheter biofilm by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis was prevented. the numbers of enterococcus faecalis and providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (p<0.05). serratia marcescens, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. only p. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/l of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. conclusions: triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by p. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several  other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. it had little effect on urease-producing p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens or m. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.

TI  == ability of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 to participate in bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelial barrier.
AB  == although hundreds of microbial species reside in the human intestinal tract, comparatively few (e.g., escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, enterococcus  faecalis, etc.) are typically associated with systemic infection in postsurgical, shock, and trauma patients. syndecan-1 is the predominant cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on epithelia, and there is substantial evidence that heparan sulfate participates in interactions of a variety of frankly pathogenic microbes with mammalian cells. to investigate the role of syndecan-1 in interactions of enteric flora with intestinal epithelium, bacteria that might  use the enterocyte as a portal of entry for systemic infection (including e. faecalis, e. coli, and other enterobacteria, and several species of staphylococci and streptococci) were studied for their abilities to interact with syndecan-1. streptococcus bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis showed increased adherence to arh-77 cells transfected to express syndecan-1. heparin, a heparan sulfate analog, inhibited internalization of s. bovis, s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, and s. aureus by ht-29 enterocytes (prominent  syndecan-1 expression), but not caco-2 enterocytes (relatively low syndecan-1 expression). data from experiments with chinese hamster ovary cells with altered  glycosaminoglycan expression indicated that heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (glycosaminoglycans on the syndecan-1 ectodomain) participated in bacterial interactions with mammalian cells. thus, although e. faecalis, e. coli, and other gram-negative enterobacteria did not appear to interact with syndecan-1, this heparan sulfate proteoglycan may mediate enterocyte interactions with some staphylococci and streptococci that are known to cause systemic infections in specific populations of high-risk, immunosuppressed, postsurgical,  and trauma patients.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid against key gram-positive organisms isolated in the united states: results of the leader 2004 surveillance program.
AB  == since the approval of linezolid in 2000, sporadic reports of resistance have been given and a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resistance has  been gained. however, since these developments, an updated status of the in vitro activity of linezolid against gram-positive organisms from the united states has  not been reported. the leader 2004 surveillance initiative was undertaken to obtain current and representative data on the activity of linezolid against key species, including isolates with significant resistance phenotypes. organisms were isolated during 2004 and included 2,872 staphylococcus aureus, 496 coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cns), 428 enterococcus faecalis, 196 enterococcus faecium, and 422 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. all s. aureus isolates (54.2% oxacillin resistant) were susceptible to linezolid (mic90 = 2 microg/ml); mic distributions were consistent, regardless of oxacillin or multidrug resistance status. for cns, one nonsusceptible isolate was encountered  (staphylococcus epidermidis; mic = 32 microg/ml), but overall, the mic(90) (1 microg/ml) was lower than that obtained with s. aureus. for e. faecalis and e. faecium, 99.5% and 96.4% of isolates, respectively, were linezolid susceptible. both species had an mic90 of 2 microg/ml, and mic distributions did not vary with the vancomycin susceptibility status of the populations analyzed. linezolid nonsusceptibility was not encountered among the s. pneumoniae isolates. these findings indicate that linezolid nonsusceptibility has remained rare among staphylococci and uncommon and sporadic among enterococci. nonetheless, careful and ongoing monitoring of the in vitro effectiveness of linezolid will be needed  so that any changes to the current status may be detected as soon as possible.

TI  == bacterial etiology of acute otitis media and clinical efficacy of amoxicillin-clavulanate versus azithromycin.
AB  == background: acute otitis media (aom) is one of the most common acute bacterial infection in childhood and also the most frequent reason for outpatient antibiotic therapy. little recent information about susceptibility patterns of aom bacterial pathogens in turkish children has been reported. objective: to determine the bacterial etiology of acute otitis media in children and to compare the efficiency of 3 days course of azithromycin with a 10 days course of amoxicillin-clavulanate. methods: this prospective, single blind, randomised comparative study was carried out in 180 children with aom. paracentesis was performed for middle ear fluid culture before the first dose antibiotic therapy.  children with acute otitis media were randomised to receive either low dose amoxicillin-clavulanate (45/6.4 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for 10 days) or low dose azithromycin (10mg/kg/day for 3 days). clinical response was assessed on days 2-4, 11-13, 26-28. results: bacterial pathogens were isolated from 108 (60%) of 180 children. streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common isolated pathogen (39.7%), followed by haemophilus influenzae (20.7%), moraxella catarrhalis (15.5%), staphylococcus aureus (13.8%), group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (5.1%), escherichia coli (3.4%) and enterococcus faecalis (1.7%). this study demonstrated low resistance rates compared to studies of different countries. although clinical response rates were better in patients treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate, this was not statistically significant [86.6% (78 of 90)] versus [95.2% (80 of 84)]. success rates of amoxicillin-clavulanate were high for both s. pneumoniae and h. influenzae. difference between success rates was not statistically significant (p=0.144 and 0.352). conclusions: bacteria were isolated in 60% of aom cases. the clinical efficiency of amoxicillin-clavulanate  was found to be equal compared to azithromycin in children with acute otitis media.

TI  == correlation between the genetic diversity of nosocomial pathogens and their survival time in intensive care units.
AB  == bacteria differ in their ability to survive in the hospital environment outside the human host. species remaining viable and infectious have a higher chance of being transmitted, giving them a fitness advantage in hospitals. this differential fitness could be expected to alter the genetic population structure  of bacterial populations in hospitals, and should be reflected by the relative abundance of several successful clones. the objective of this study was to test for a potential correlation between tenacity, i.e. environmental survival, and clonal abundance determined by the genetic diversity in different bacterial species from prospectively collected isolates of intensive care patients. a literature review was performed to identify mean environmental survival times for the most important pathogens in intensive care units (icus): staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, acetinobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter spp., escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. to determine the genetic diversity of the natural population of these species in icus, a prospective 18-month study was conducted in five units with median nosocomial infection rates. all clinical isolates were collected, and highly discriminatory dna fingerprinting techniques were used to identify specific clones. a diversity index for each species was calculated as the number  of distinguishable genotypes in the population divided by size. the correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was investigated using non-parametric methods. although 21 studies were identified in the literature, only two were relevant. they showed median survival times between 1.5 days (p. aeruginosa) and 60.0 days (enterococcus faecium). during the prospective icu study, 1264 pathogens were investigated and simple diversity indices between 49.1 (enterococcus faecalis) and 89.8 (e. coli) were found. a correlation between survival times and the diversity indices for the individual pathogens was found (correlation coefficient 0.821, p=0.024). environmental survival may be an important factor contributing to the ecological fitness of some nosocomial pathogens in icus. infection control measures should consider this finding.

TI  == detection and characterization of tet(m) in tetracycline-resistant listeria strains from human and food-processing origins in belgium and france.
AB  == in the present study, three listeria monocytogenes strains and one listeria innocua strain out of a collection of 241 listeria isolates from human and food-processing sources were found to display resistance to tetracycline (tc) due to the presence of the tet(m) gene. through sequence analysis, it was shown that  tet(m) genes in two of the isolates belong to sequence homology group (shg) ii, a group comprising chromosomally encoded tet(m) genes previously found in staphylococcus aureus and in lactobacilli. the tet(m) genes of the two other l. monocytogenes strains were associated with a member of the tn916-tn1545 family of conjugative transposons and were closely related to shg iii, which harbours enterococcal tet(m) genes associated with tn916. one of these transposon-containing strains was able to transfer the tet(m) gene to enterococcus faecalis recipient strain jh2-2. collectively, these sequence and conjugation data indicate that the acquisition of tet(m) by listeria strains may  be triggered by successive transfers between other gram-positive organisms.

TI  == x-ray crystal structures of hmg-coa synthase from enterococcus faecalis and a complex with its second substrate/inhibitor acetoacetyl-coa.
AB  == biosynthesis of the isoprenoid precursor, isopentenyl diphosphate, is a critical  function in all independently living organisms. there are two major pathways for  this synthesis, the non-mevalonate pathway found in most eubacteria and the mevalonate pathway found in animal cells and a number of pathogenic bacteria. an  early step in this pathway is the condensation of acetyl-coa and acetoacetyl-coa  into hmg-coa, catalyzed by the enzyme hmg-coa synthase. to explore the possibility of a small molecule inhibitor of the enzyme functioning as a non-cell wall antibiotic, the structure of hmg-coa synthase from enterococcus faecalis (mvas) was determined by selenomethionine mad phasing to 2.4 a and the enzyme complexed with its second substrate, acetoacetyl-coa, to 1.9 a. these structures  show that hmg-coa synthase from enterococcus is a member of the family of thiolase fold enzymes and, while similar to the recently published hmg-coa synthase structures from staphylococcus aureus, exhibit significant differences in the structure of the c-terminal domain. the acetoacetyl-coa binary structure demonstrates reduced coenzyme a and acetoacetate covalently bound to the active site cysteine through a thioester bond. this is consistent with the kinetics of the reaction that have shown acetoacetyl-coa to be a potent inhibitor of the overall reaction, and provides a starting point in the search for a small molecule inhibitor.

AB  == enterocin as-48 is a candidate bacteriocin for food biopreservation. before addressing application of as-48 to vegetable-based foods, the interaction between as-48 and vegetable food components and the stability of as-48 were studied. enterocin as-48 had variable interactions with fruit and vegetable juices, with complete, partial, or negligible loss of activity. for some juices, loss of activity was ameliorated by increasing the bacteriocin concentration, diluting the juice, or applying a heat pretreatment. in juices obtained from cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, green beans, celery, and avocado, as-48 was very stable for the first 24 to 48 h of storage under refrigeration, and decay of activity was markedly influenced by storage temperature. in fresh-made fruit juices (orange, apple, grapefruit, pear, pineapple, and kiwi) and juice mixtures, as-48 was very  stable for at least 15 days at 4 degrees c, and bacteriocin activity was still detectable after 30 days of storage. gradual and variable loss of activity occurred in juices stored at 15 and 28 degrees c; inactivation was faster at higher temperatures. in commercial fruit juices (orange, apple, peach, and pineapple) stored at 4 degrees c, the bacteriocin was completely stable for up to 120 days, and over 60% of initial activity was still present in juices stored at  15 degrees c for the same period. commercial fruit juices stored at 28 degrees c  for 120 days retained between 31.5% (apple) and 67.71% (peach) of their initial bacteriocin activity. solutions of as-48 in sterile distilled water were stable (120 days at 4 to 28 degrees c). limited loss of activity was observed after mixing as-48 with some food-grade dyes and thickening agents. enterocin as-48 added to lettuce juice incubated at 15 degrees c reduced viable counts of listeria monocytogenes cect 4032 and bacillus cereus lwl1 to below detection limits and markedly reduced viable counts of staphylococcus aureus cect 976.

TI  == the safety of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement in patients with existing ventriculoperitoneal shunts.
AB  == background: because the insertion of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes (peg) involves disruption of the gastrointestinal tract with potential peritoneal contamination, patients with indwelling ventriculoperitoneal (vp) shunts could be at increased risk of meningitis, a potentially devastating infection. the safety  of peg placement in the presence of a vp shunt is unclear. methods: a retrospective chart review was performed that included all adult patients with existing vp shunts requiring peg placement at a single university medical center  over an approximate 9-year period from july 1995 to march 2004. results: thirty-nine patients who underwent peg placement 2-564 days after shunt placement were identified. two patients (5%) subsequently developed meningitis. cerebrospinal fluid cultures demonstrated staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus  faecalis. these infections occurred 2 and 15 months after peg placement, respectively. at the time of peg placement, 17 patients (44%) were receiving antibiotics for reasons other than operative prophylaxis, and 11 patients (28%) received prophylactic antibiotics. both infected patients had received antibiotics at the time of peg placement. conclusions: these data constitute the  largest series of patients with existing vp shunts undergoing peg placement reported to date. when compared with the published 2%-5% infection rate for patients with vp shunts alone, our data do not suggest an increased risk of infection for patients after peg placement. as the total number of adult patients requiring a peg after vp shunt placement is low, multicenter studies should be carried out to better stratify this risk.

TI  == detection of a novel aph(2") allele (aph[2"]-ie) conferring high-level gentamicin resistance and a spectinomycin resistance gene ant(9)-ia (aad 9) in clinical isolates of enterococci.
AB  == aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (ames) are major factors that confer aminoglycoside resistance to enterococci. in an epidemiologic study on distribution of 12 ame genes in 534 recent clinical strains isolated from a japanese hospital, two uncommon ame genes, ant(9)-ia and a novel aph(2") allele,  aph(2")-ie, were detected. ant(9)-ia had been reported only in staphylococcus aureus and encodes spectinomycin adenylyltransferase ant(9)-i, which confers resistance to spectinomycin. the ant(9)-ia gene was detected in three strains, a  single strain each of enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and e. avium. nucleotide sequences of ant(9)-ia from these three enterococcal species were identical to that reported for s. aureus and considered to be located on tn 554. the new aph(2") allele, designated aph(2")-ie, was identified in three e. faecium strains. the aph(2")-ie allele was genetically close to aph(2")-id reported in e. casseliflavus (93.7% amino acid sequence identity; 96.3% similarity), while distant from aph(2")-ia, aph(2")-ib, or aph(2")-ic (26.3-29.5% amino acid sequence identity). sequence divergence between aph(2")-id and aph(2")-ie was mostly located in amino-terminal half. in contrast, sequences corresponding to the three motifs required for aminoglycoside phosphotransferase were conserved except for a single amino acid. three e. faecium strains having aph(2")-ie showed high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin, but not to kanamycin, dibekacin, and tobramycin, unlike enzyme specificity described for aph(2")-id in  e. casseliflavus. such a difference in resistance phenotype was suggested to be related to amino acid sequence divergence between aph(2")-id and aph(2")-ie.

TI  == cationic peptide of the male reproductive tract, he2alpha, displays antimicrobial activity against neisseria gonorrhoeae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == objectives: to analyse the in vitro antimicrobial effects of synthetic he2alpha peptide against neisseria gonorrhoeae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. methods: the he2alpha peptide was synthesized based on the c-terminal sequence of the he2alpha protein. the bacterial strains tested included two antibiotic-susceptible strains of n. gonorrhoeae and four antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates, as well as s. aureus atcc 29213 and e. faecalis atcc 29212. susceptibility determinations were carried out either in 0.7% casamino acids for  n. gonorrhoeae isolates or in 10 mm phosphate buffer for s. aureus and e. faecalis strains. antibacterial effects were measured in a dose- and time-dependent manner. after exposure to the peptide in solution, the number of viable cells was determined by counting colony forming units (cfu). results: the  he2alpha peptide exhibited time- and dose-dependent antibacterial effects on all  n. gonorrhoeae isolates tested. s. aureus and e. faecalis strains were also susceptible to the peptide. all strains tested were susceptible to the peptide at high concentrations (50 or 100 mg/l) and some strains were susceptible to a peptide concentration of 25 mg/l. conclusions: the peptide he2alpha, which is derived from the male urogenital tract, exhibits antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens in vitro. the peptide is active against both antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant n. gonorrhoeae isolates. further investigation of the antimicrobial properties of the peptide is warranted.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sm-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  == sm-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. in agar dilution susceptibility testing, the mic of sm-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains tested (mic(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was  comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. sm-216601 was also very potent against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (mic(90) = 8 microg/ml). sm-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, moraxella  catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis, with mic(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. the therapeutic efficacy of sm-216601 against experimentally induced  infections in mice caused by s. aureus, e. faecium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. thus, sm-216601 is a promising  candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.

TI  == analysis of antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of leg ulcer bacterial flora in patients hospitalized at dermatology department, poznan university hospital.
AB  == effective treatment of frequently infected, poorly healing wounds such as leg ulcers due to chronic venous insufficiency poses a major clinical problem. antibiotic resistance in dermatology patients, especially those with non-healing  leg ulcers, is a widespread phenomenon. various antibiotics, mainly broad-spectrum agents, are frequently and sometimes inappropriately prescribed, which often leads to the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains. the  aim of this study was to analyze antibiotic susceptibility and resistance of bacterial isolates cultured from leg ulcers. wound swabs were obtained from patients admitted to dermatology department, poznan university of medical sciences, during the 1998-2002 period. bacteriologic diagnosis of 175 wound swabs was performed in compliance with compulsory laboratory methods. the analysis yielded 173 positive results, predominated by staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas  aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and escherichia coli. bacterial isolates were evaluated for resistance to commonly used antibiotics, taking into consideration the presence of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus strains. antibiotic resistance profiles were compared between the years 1998 and 2002, with detailed account of clinical characteristics and history of leg ulcers disease. the study pointed to an increasing tendency of antibiotic resistance in the study group of patients.

TI  == is the use o f gunnera perpensa extracts in endometritis related to antibacterial activity?
AB  == rhizome extracts of gunnera perpensa are used in traditional remedies in south africa to treat endometritis both in humans and animals. an investigation was undertaken to determine whether this plant possesses antibacterial activity, which may explain its efficacy. gunnera perpensa rhizome extracts were prepared serially with solvents of increasing polarity and tested for antibacterial activity. test bacteria included the gram-positive enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus and the gram-negative escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a moderate to weak level of antibacterial activity in most of the extracts resulted, with the best minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) value of  2.61 mg ml(-1) shown by the acetone extract against s. aureus. the extracts were  also submitted to the brine shrimp assay to detect possible toxic or pharmacological effects. all the extracts were lethal to the brine shrimp larvae  at a concentration of 5 mg ml(-1). the acetone extract was extremely toxic at 1 mg ml(-1), with some toxicity evident at 0.1 mg ml(-1). the remainder of the extracts generally displayed little activity at concentrations lower than 5 mg ml(-1). in summary, the results indicate that although the extracts demonstrated  a level of pharmacological activity, the relatively weak antibacterial activity is unlikely to justify the use of g. perpensa rhizomes in the traditional treatment of endometritis. rather, the slightly antibacterial nature of the rhizomes may contribute to an additive effect, along with their known uterotonic  activity, to the overall efficacy of the preparation.

TI  == tigecycline mic testing by broth dilution requires use of fresh medium or addition of the biocatalytic oxygen-reducing reagent oxyrase to standardize the test method.
AB  == tigecycline is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic with activity against not only susceptible gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens but also strains that are resistant to many other antibiotics. in the process of determining quality control (qc) limits for the american type culture collection reference strains for tigecycline, a number of inconsistencies in mics were encountered which appeared to be related to the age of the mueller-hinton broth (mhb) medium  used in the mic testing. the objective of this study was to determine the cause of the discrepant mic results between fresh and aged mhb. the mics of tigecycline were determined in mhb that was either prepared fresh (<12 h old), prepared and stored at 4 degrees c, stored at room temperature, stored anaerobically, or supplemented with the biocatalytic oxygen-reducing reagent oxyrase. when tested in fresh media, tigecycline was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against the clsi-recommended qc strains compared to aged media (mics of 0.03 to 0.25 and 0.12 to 0.5 mug/ml, respectively). media aged under anaerobic conditions prior to testing or supplemented with oxyrase resulted in mics similar to those obtained in fresh medium (mics of 0.03 to 0.12 and 0.03 to 0.25 mug/ml, respectively). time-kill kinetics demonstrated a >3 log(10) difference in viable growth when tigecycline was tested in fresh or oxyrase-supplemented mhb compared to aged mhb. high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis revealed the accumulation of an early peak (oxidative by-product of tigecycline) to be 3.5% in fresh media and 25.1% in aged media after 24 h and that addition of oxyrase prevented the accumulation of this oxidized by-product. these results suggested that the activity of tigecycline was affected by the amount of dissolved oxygen in the media. the use of fresh mhb or supplementation with oxyrase resulted in a more standardized test method for performing mic tests with tigecycline.

TI  == rationale for using peltophorum africanum (fabaceae) extracts in veterinary medicine.
AB  == peltophorum africanum (fabaceae) is a deciduous tree widespread in southern africa. the plant has many ethnomedical and ethnoveterinary uses. root and bark decoctions are used to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, sore throat, wounds, back and  joint pains, hiv-aids, venereal diseases and infertility. pastoralists and rural  farmers use the root and bark extracts to treat diarrhoea, dysentery, infertility, and to promote well-being and resistance to diseases in cattle. to evaluate these ethnobotanical leads, dried leaves, stem bark and root bark were extracted with ethanol, acetone, dichloromethane and hexane. polyphenols in the extract were determined by the folin-ciocalteu method with gallic acid as standard. qualitative antioxidant activity was screened by spraying thin layer chromatograms (tlc) of the extracts with 0.2% 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (dpph), and quantified with trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (teac) assay.  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and total antibacterial activity (taa) were determined by serial microplate dilution for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, with gentamicin as standard and tetrazolium violet as growth indicator. acetone and ethanol extracted the largest quantity of material. polyphenols concentration was 49.2% in acetone extract of the root and 3.8% in dichloromethane extract of the leaf. antioxidant activity of at least 5 antioxidant compounds as measured by teac ranged from 1.34 (ethanol extract of the root) to 0.01 (hexane extract of the leaf). the total antibacterial activity (volume to which active compounds present in 1 g plant material can be diluted and still inhibit bacterial growth)  was 1263 ml/g for ethanol extract of the root against s. aureus, and 800 ml/g for acetone extract of the root against p. aeruginosa. there was substantial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with mic values of 0.08 mg/ml for s. aureus and 0.16 mg/ml for p. aeruginosa. there is therefore a rationale for the traditional use of root and bark of p. africanum in treating bacterial infection related diseases.

AB  == a general strategy for the expression of bacterial membrane transport and receptor genes in escherichia coli is described. expression is amplified so that  the encoded proteins comprise 5-35% of e. coli inner membrane protein. depending  upon their topology, proteins are produced with rgsh6 or a strep tag at the c-terminus. these enable purification in mg quantities for crystallization and nmr studies. examples of one nutrient uptake and one multidrug extrusion protein  from helicobacter pylori are described. this strategy is successful for membrane  proteins from h. pylori, e. coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, microbacterium liquefaciens, brucella abortus, brucella melitensis, campylobacter jejuni, neisseria meningitides, streptomyces coelicolor and rhodobacter sphaeroides.

TI  == garlic natural health products exhibit variable constituent levels and antimicrobial activity against neisseria gonorrhoeae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == the composition of 19 garlic natural health products (nhps) and fresh garlic extracts were determined, as was their antibacterial activity. the 19 nhps and 5  fresh garlic extract standards were analysed for their principal active constituents. they were also extracted for 5, 10 or 15 min in water to fresh garlic equivalents of 200 mg/ml. the extract's minimum inhibitory concentrations  (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against three indicator microorganisms (neisseria gonorrhoeae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) were determined by the broth microdilution method. while 47% of the aqueous garlic nhp extracts exhibited activity against n. gonorrhoeae, only 16% of the aqueous extracts inhibited s. aureus or e. faecalis at all three timepoints. generally, products with high antimicrobial activity contained higher levels of garlic constituents with comparable activity to fresh garlic extracts,  while products with marginal antibacterial activity often contained lower concentrations of constituents than their product labels indicated. different extraction times affected antibacterial activity only against n. gonorrhoeae and  tended to be correlated with levels of allicin. thus, many extracts showed discrepancies in both composition, allicin:alliin ratio and antimicrobial activity, raising concerns as to standards of preparation and quality control for these products.

TI  == peptides selected for binding to a virulent strain of haemophilus influenzae by phage display are bactericidal.
AB  == nontypeable haemophilus influenzae (nthi) is an obligate parasite of the oropharynx of humans, in whom it commonly causes mucosal infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. we used a subtractive phage display approach to affinity select for peptides binding to the cell surface of a novel invasive nthi strain r2866 (also called int1). over half of the selected phage peptides tested were bactericidal toward r2866 in a dose-dependent manner. five of the clones encoded the same peptide sequence (kqrtsirategclps; clone hi3/17),  while the remaining four clones encoded unique peptides. all of the bactericidal  phage peptides but one were cationic and had similar physical-chemical properties. clone hi3/17 possessed a similar level of activity toward a panel of  clinical nthi isolates and h. influenzae type b strains but lacked bactericidal activity toward gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus) and  gram-negative (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica) bacteria. these data indicate that peptides binding to bacterial surface structures isolated by phage display may prove of value in developing new antibiotics.

TI  == antibacterial properties of some cyclic organobismuth(iii) compounds.
AB  == bismuth compounds are known for their low levels of toxicity in mammals, and various types of bismuth salts have been used to treat medical disorders. as part of our program to probe this aspect of bismuth chemistry, cyclic organobismuth compounds 1 to 8 bearing a nitrogen or sulfur atom as an additional ring member have been synthesized, and their antimicrobial activities against five standard strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were assessed. the eight-membered-ring compounds, compounds 1 to 3, exhibited mics of less than 0.5  microg/ml against staphylococcus aureus and were more active than the six-membered ones, compounds 5 to 8 (mics, 4.0 to 16 microg/ml). the gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, and enterococcus faecalis) were more susceptible to both types of ring compounds than the gram-negative ones (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa). treatment with polymyxin b nonapeptide increased the susceptibility of e. coli to cyclic organobismuth compounds, indicating the low permeability of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria to the compounds. compound 1 also had activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus, which had an mic for 90% of the hospital stock strains of 1.25 microg/ml. the killing curves for s. aureus treated with compound 1 or 3 revealed a static effect at a low dose (2x the mic). however, when s. aureus was treated with 10x the mic of compound 1 or 3, there was an approximately 3-log reduction in the viable cell number after 48 h of treatment.  electron microscopic inspection demonstrated a considerable increase in the size  of s. aureus and the proportion of cells undergoing cell division after treatment with compound 1 at 0.5x the mic.

TI  == nosocomial infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci at a university hospital in taiwan from 1991 to  2003: resistance trends, antibiotic usage and in vitro activities of newer antimicrobial agents.
AB  == a rapid increase of nosocomial methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) infection (from 39% in 1991 to 75% in 2003) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci  (vre) (from 1.2% in 1996 to 6.1% in 2003) at a university hospital in taiwan was  found. the noticeable rise of mrsa and vre was significantly correlated with the  increased consumption of glycopeptides, beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones  (pearson's correlation coefficient, p < 0.05). minimum inhibitory concentrations  (mics) of 100 non-duplicate blood isolates of mrsa (in 2003) and of 25 non-duplicate isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and 172 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (in 1996-2003) causing nosocomial infection recovered from various clinical specimens of patients treated at the hospital to nine antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. all of these isolates were susceptible to linezolid and were inhibited by 0.5mg/l of tigecycline, and all mrsa isolates were inhibited by daptomycin 1mg/l, including two isolates of mrsa with heteroresistance to vancomycin. daptomycin had two-fold better activity against vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis (mic90, 2 mg/l) than against vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (mic90, 4 mg/l). decreased susceptibilities of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and mrsa to quinupristin/dalfopristin (non-susceptibility 25% and 8%, respectively) were found. telithromycin had poor activity against the isolates tested (mic90, 8 mg/l). linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline may represent therapeutic options for infections caused by these resistant gram-positive organisms.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate reliability of identification and determination of sensitivity to antibiotics and chemotherapeutics of some gram positive cocci strains in 34 sanitary-epidemiological stations. all laboratories  engaged in this study received 3 strains: s. aureus (s. aureus sc+ cf+, resistant to methicillin., or s. aureus sc - cf+, sensitive to methicillin), coagulase-negative staphylococci (s. epidermidis or s. haemolyticus or s. saprophyticus) and enterococcus sp. (e. faecalis hlar-positive or e. faecalis hlar-negative or e. faecium or e. gallinarum). all these strains previously were  identified in department of bacteriology of national institute of hygiene. of the 68 staphylococci strains tested, 66 isolates were correctly identified. among the 34 enterococcal strains studied the greatest difficulty in identification was caused by e. gallinarum strain--(8 out of 13 strains were incorrectly recognised). the determination of the sensitivity of the control strains to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents, generally was performed correctly in accordance with to the nccls and national recommendations. some incorrect results of the antibiograms were caused by an erroneous interpretation of the zones of inhibition.

AB  == bloodstream infection (bsi) is a significant problem after cord blood transplantation (cbt). however, little information has been reported on bsi after reduced-intensity cbt (ri-cbt). we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 102 patients. the median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 17-79 years). preparative regimens comprised fludarabine 125 to 150 mg/m 2 , melphalan  80 to 140 mg/m 2 , or busulfan 8 mg/kg and total body irradiation 2 to 8 gy. prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease comprised cyclosporin or tacrolimus. bsi developed within 100 days of ri-cbt in 32 patients. the cumulative incidence of bsi was 25% at day 30 and 32% at day 100. the median onset was day 15 (range, 1-98 days). causative organisms included pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 12), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 11), staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), enterococcus faecium (n = 4), enterococcus faecalis (n = 4), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 4), and others (n = 7). of the 32 patients with bsi, 25 (84%) died within 100 days after ri-cbt. bsi was the direct cause of death in 8 patients (25%). univariate analysis failed to identify any significant risk factors. bsi clearly represents a significant and fatal complication after ri-cbt. further studies are warranted to determine clinical characteristics, identify patients at high risk of bsi, and establish therapeutic strategies.

(2) uropathogens from a multicenter study comprising 37 urological centers throughout germany. (3) methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) isolates of patients and staff within the hospital st. elisabeth, straubing. genotyping of the latter isolates was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of daptomycin, linezolid, vancomycin, and ampicillin (only tested against enterococci) were determined by an agar dilution method using a multipointer with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu per point. results: for all methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n = 25), mrsa (n = 49), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 129), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 33), for enterococcus faecalis (n = 289), and for enterococcus faecium (n =  4) the mics ranged up to 2 mg/l (daptomycin, linezolid), up to 4 mg/l (vancomycin), and up to 8 mg/l (ampicillin, enterococci only) indicating that all strains were susceptible to the antibiotics tested. conclusions: according to the in vitro activity daptomycin may be considered a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of complicated uti caused by gram-positive uropathogens. thus,  daptomycin should be evaluated in a clinical study.

AB  == purpose: to evaluate the in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetics of vancomycin delivered from glycerylmonostearate (gms) implants in a prosthetic-device based biofilm infection model. methods: a biofilm infection model was developed in male sprague-dawley rats by implanting a vascular graft on the dorsal side of each rat and infecting it with 1.5 x 10(8) cfu/ml staphylococcus epidermidis. the rats were divided into 3 groups of 6 rats each: 1) the control group that received no  antibiotics, 2) the im group that received multiple im injections of vancomycin at a dose of 25 mg/kg every 6 h for a total of 12 doses, and 3) the implant group that received gms implants designed to deliver vancomycin at a total dose of 300  mg/kg for a period of 4 days. the pharmacokinetics of vancomycin was determined from im and implant groups by analyzing for vancomycin in blood using hplc. in vivo efficacy was studied by evaluation of the wound site and the prosthetic device upon excision, for evidence of infection in the form of purulent discharge at the wound site and yellowish discoloration of the prosthetic device and inflammation as sign of biofilm formation. microbiological evaluation on the wound site and the prosthetic device was performed by culturing the swabs at the  wound site and the prosthetic device in sterile tryptic soy broth for 36-48 h at  37 degrees c. results: vancomycin was successfully delivered in a sustained manner for 100 h from gms implants and the resulting plasma profile showed that the concentrations, after an initial burst, plateaued at about of 4.77 +/- 1.43 mug/ml with less fluctuations than the im group in which the plasma concentrations fluctuated between 2.73 +/- 0.94 mug/ml and 19.26 +/- 3.67 mug/ml. upon excision of the wound site, all the animals in the control group developed infection in the form of purulent discharge and yellowish discoloration of the prosthetic device. however, none of the rats in the implant group showed evidence of infection clearly demonstrating the efficacy of the local delivery system in preventing infection. systemically delivered vancomycin by im injections failed to prevent infection in four out of six rats. microbiological evaluation of the wound site and prosthetic device resulted in isolation of biofilm-producing organisms such as staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. these organisms were isolated in greater number of animals in the control group compared to the im and implant groups. conclusions: the gms  implants as a delivery system for vancomycin were successful in preventing infection in all the animals compared to the im and control groups demonstrating  the efficacy of a local delivery system in a prosthetic device related biofilm infection model.

TI  == daptomycin: a new drug class for the treatment of gram-positive infections.
AB  == daptomycin is the first member of a new class of bactericidal antibiotics, the cyclic lipopeptides. in september 2003, daptomycin was approved for the treatment of gram-positive infections associated with complicated skin and skin structure infections. a key feature of daptomycin is its rapid, concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against significant gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, glycopeptide-intermediate and -resistant s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (vre). daptomycin also has a unique mechanism of action, no  cross-resistance with any other class of antibiotic and a relatively prolonged concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect in vitro. in the united states, daptomycin has been approved for use at a dose of 4 mg/ kg once daily in the treatment of s. aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), three beta-hemolytic streptococci (s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis) and e. faecalis associated with complicated skin and skin structure infections. in addition, daptomycin is undergoing a phase iii evaluation for the treatment of bacteremia and endocarditis due to s. aureus. with its once-daily dosing, favorable safety profile and low potential for resistance, daptomycin is a powerful new antibiotic therapy against gram-positive infections.

TI  == efficacy of current agents used in the treatment of gram-positive infections and  the consequences of resistance.
AB  == the proportion of pathogens causing hospital-onset infections that are resistant  to antimicrobial agents continues to increase worldwide. inadequate antimicrobial therapy is an important factor in the emergence of resistance and is associated with increased mortality. in the usa in 2000, the national nosocomial infections  surveillance system reported that >50% of staphylococcus aureus isolates collected from intensive care units were resistant to methicillin (mrsa). the emergence of community-acquired mrsa is a new concern. mrsa are associated with adverse clinical outcomes and increased hospital costs. the increasing prevalence of mrsa contributes to the use of glycopeptides; however, isolates with intermediate and full resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin are now being reported. newer agents, such as the oxazolidinone linezolid, are effective in the treatment of serious gram-positive infections; however, linezolid-resistant isolates of enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and s. aureus have been reported. therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for new agents with activity against gram-positive pathogens. daptomycin, a lipopeptide with a novel mode of action, was recently approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections in the usa. the two case studies presented herein detail experience with the use of daptomycin in the usa.

TI  == [inhibition of hemolytic activity of staphylococcus aureus 3-hemolysin by an exosubstance produced by some enterococcus faecalis strains].
AB  == objective: accidentally, some enterococcus faecalis strains were found to inhibit the hemolysis caused by staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin. the study objectives were to define the conditions under which this phenomenon appears and  to characterize the inhibitory agent. materials and methods: ninety-one wild strains and five type strains of e. faecalis and nine wild e. faecium strains were tested for antihemolytic activity on blood agar with 5% sheep erythrocytes prepared using the following agar bases: columbia agar base (bbl, 211124), columbia agar (bio merieux, 51026), blood agar base (bio-rad, 64524), blood agar  base (columbia) (ferosa, 1-034), columbia blood agar base (himedia, m114), blood  agar base no. 4 (imuna), columbia agar base (merck, 10455) and columbia agar base (oxoid, cm331). the exosubstance produced by e. faecalis strains was isolated by  means of acetone precipitation and was exposed to elevated temperature and trypsin. results: thirty-three (36%) out of 91 wild strains of e. faecalis produced the substance inhibiting hemolysis caused by staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin. two out of five e. faecalis type strains and none of e. faecium strains appeared to be producers of the same substance. inhibition of the hemolysis was observed on all of the media tested, being the most pronounced with the use of blood agar base no. 4 (imuna) and columbia agar base (bbl) at ph 7.0-7.5 when cultured at 37 degrees c for 24 hours. the exosubstance lost its inhibitory effect after exposure to 70 degrees c for 15 min and to 0.1% trypsin for 30 min. the inhibitory potential against staphylococcal hemolysis correlated  with the ability of strains to produce protease. conclusion: about one third of wild e. faecalis strains produce a protease-like substance that seems proteinaceous in nature and has an inhibitory effect on the hemolysis caused by staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin.

(2) only pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis could ly shorten the cholesterol nucleation time. (3) with  pseudomonas aeruginosa or enterococcus faecalis added in model bile, the formation of cholesterol crystals presented a progressive course of evolution. conclusions: pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, not propionibacterium acne, have pro-nucleating ability in model bile.

TI  == survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
AB  == in 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  we assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoints recommended by the national committee  for clinical standards (nccls). methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. the most common gram-positive species was enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (bls), fluoroquinolones (fqs), and tetracyclines (tcs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. the proportion of fq-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl). all the esbl-producing strains (esbls) possess resistance to fqs. over 95% of klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. the distribution of antimicrobial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and  an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among proteus species. no esbl-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from serratia marcescens. this survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of esbl-producing or fqs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == bacteria induce expression of apoptosis in human spermatozoa.
AB  == an increased number of sperm undergoing apoptosis has been observed during inflammatory processes in the male genital tract, which might be associated with  elevated reactive oxygen species (ros) levels. however, another factor to stimulate apoptosis could be the direct contact with bacteria or its products, even in the absence of ros. the aim of this study was to investigate whether bacteria can directly initiate apoptosis in human spermatozoa. human spermatozoa  selected by density gradient centrifugation were incubated with polymorphonuclear granulocytes (pmn) isolated from blood and/or e. faecalis, e. coli or s. aureus.  as ros inductor in pmn, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate was used. after incubating the cells for 60 min at 37 degrees c, ros were determined by chemiluminescence and phosphatidyl serine (ps) externalization was analyzed by flow cytometry with annexin v-fitc and propidium iodide (pi). the increase in the percentage of spermatozoa annexin v-fitc-positive/ pi-negative (early event of late apoptosis) was significant after the incubation with pmn plus pma, pmn plus  e. coli and e. coli alone. the percentage of spermatozoa annexin v-fitc-positive/ pi-positive (apoptosis/necrosis) increased significantly in sperm incubated with  e. coli and s. aureus (20.3% +/- 3 and 13.6% +/- 3.2 compared to sperm alone, 6%  +/- 0.5). sperm incubated with pmn-pma activated showed only a relative increase  in apoptosis/necrosis (8.4% +/- 1). our results show that bacteria directly increase the ps externalisation in ejaculated human sperm. this way of inducing apoptosis does not require external ros and may result from anyone of the molecular mechanisms that account for changes in motility, vitality and dna integrity, that are characteristics of spermatozoa in male genital tract infection.

TI  == plant models for animal pathogenesis.
AB  == several bacteria that are pathogenic to animals also infect plants. mechanistic studies have proven that some human/animal pathogenic bacteria employ a similar subset of virulence determinants to elicit disease in animals, invertebrates and  plants. therefore, the results of plant infection studies are relevant to animal  pathogenesis. this discovery has resulted in the development of convenient, cost-effective, and reliable plant infection models to study the molecular basis  of infection by animal pathogens. plant infection models provide a number of advantages in the study of animal pathogenesis. using a plant model, mutations in animal pathogenic bacteria can easily be screened for putative virulence factors, a process which if done using existing animal infection models would be time-consuming and tedious. high-throughput screening of plants also provides the potential for unravelling the mechanisms by which plants resist animal pathogenic bacteria, and provides a means to discover novel therapeutic agents such as antibiotics and anti-infective compounds. in this review, we describe the developing technique of using plants as a model system to study pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus pathogenesis, and discuss ways to use this new technology against disease warfare and other types of bioterrorism.

TI  == molecular diversity of a putative virulence factor: purification and characterization of isoforms of an extracellular serine glutamyl endopeptidase of enterococcus faecalis with different enzymatic activities.
AB  == a previously identified gene spre of enterococcus faecalis strain og1 was shown to encode an extracellular serine protease that appears to belong to the glutamyl endopeptidase i staphylococcal group. a single form of spre with a molecular mass of 25 kda and a ph optimum between 7.0 and 7.5 was isolated from culture supernatant of wild-type e. faecalis strain og1rf (tx4002); this form was apparently generated by cleavage of the ser-1-leu1 and arg230-leu231 peptide bonds of the secreted zymogen. in contrast, the culture supernatant of the gelatinase-null mutant, tx5264, with a nonpolar deletion of gele which encodes the e. faecalis gelatinase, was found to contain several forms of spre proteolytically processed on both the n and c termini; in addition to a full-length zymogen and a truncated zymogen, three mature forms of the spre proteinase, leu1-ala237, ser-1-glu227, and leu1-glu227, were identified. as with  the v8 proteinase of staphylococcus aureus, the closest homologue of spre, all of the active forms cleaved specifically glu-xaa peptide bonds but with substantially different efficiencies, while none was able to hydrolyze peptide bonds with asp in the p1 position. the most active of all these enzyme forms against several substrates, including human fibrinogen and beta-chain insulin, was the ser-1-glu227 (-1s-spre) isolated from tx5264; -1s-spre, in contrast to other forms of spre, was unstable at 37 degrees c, apparently due to autodegradation. in conclusion, our results demonstrate that spre encodes a highly specific serine-type glutamyl endopeptidase, the maturation of which is dependent on the presence of gelatinase. in the absence of gelatinase activity, the aberrant processing of pro-spre results in the appearance of a "superactive"  form of the enzyme, -1s-spre.

AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == successful treatment of chronic bone and joint infections with oral linezolid.
AB  == linezolid is an attractive alternative for the treatment of chronic bone and joint infections because it is active against common pathogens including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococci and because its oral formulation is convenient for long-term administration. to evaluate the ability of linezolid to produce long-term remission, we prospectively monitored 11 consecutive adult patients who received linezolid for  osteomyelitis (n = 9) or prosthetic joint infection (n = 2). linezolid 600 mg was administered orally twice daily for a mean of 10 weeks (range, 6 to 19 weeks). pathogens were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 4), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (n = 1), and vancomycin-sensitive enterococcus faecalis (n = 1). after a mean followup of 27 months (range, 17 to 41 months), all 11 patients had remission by clinical, laboratory, and radiographic criteria. during week 8 of linezolid treatment, one patient developed a gram-negative superinfection, which resolved with appropriate therapy. during week 6 of linezolid treatment, one patient developed mild thrombocytopenia and another patient developed mild anemia. both episodes of myelosuppression were reversible within 10 days after completing the planned 6-week courses of linezolid. we recommend weekly complete blood counts to detect  hematologic abnormalities. we conclude that oral linezolid seems to be a useful and convenient alternative for the treatment of bone and joint infections.

TI  == potent antibacterial activity of halogenated compounds against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == common gram-positive clinical pathogens are showing an increasing trend for resistance to conventional antimicrobial agents. new drugs with potent antibacterial activities are urgently needed to remediate this problem. halogenated compounds isolated from several species of the red algae genus laurencia were examined for their antibacterial activity against 22 strains of human pathogenic bacteria, 7 strains of which were antibiotic-resistant bacteria. four phenolic sesquiterpenes and a polybrominated indole showed wide spectra of antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium (vre). in addition, laurinterol and allolaurinterol displayed potent bactericidal activity against three strains of mrsa at 3.13 microg ml(-1), and three strains of vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus, at 3.13 microg ml(-1) and 6.25 microg ml(-1), respectively.

TI  == syntheses, in vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of a series of 3-substituted succinimides.
AB  == we have synthesized a series of 3-substituted succinimides and their in vitro antibacterial activities have been tested towards gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from the atcc collection. some of them possess significant antibacterial activity against gram-positive organisms (staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212) but all are poorly active or inactive against gram-negative organisms (escherichia coli atcc 25922 and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853). the compounds with the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations (esters of 3-hydroxy succinimides) are also the most cytotoxic against green monkey vero cell line (atcc ccl-81) and could explain that perhaps apoptosis should be implicated in eukaryotic cell cytotoxicity of succinimides.

TI  == in vitro exposure of bacteria to antimicrobial impregnated-central venous catheters does not directly lead to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == objective: use of central venous catheters (cvcs) impregnated with minocycline and rifampin reduces the density of bacterial growth on catheters and decreases the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections. questions have been raised over the possibility that the use of these catheters will lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. in this study, we sought to determine if in vitro exposure of four test organisms to catheter segments impregnated with minocycline and rifampin would lead to the development of antibiotic resistance. methods: catheter segments (1.0 cm) were placed on the surface of agar plates previously inoculated with bacterial suspensions, such that a subconfluent lawn of colony growth would be apparent after 24 h incubation at 35 degrees c in air. test organisms included american type culture collection  strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. zones of inhibition of colony growth surrounding catheters were measured at 24-h intervals up to 7 days  (two catheter segments per test). colonies on agar surfaces located at varying distances from catheter segments were examined for minocycline and rifampin resistance following various periods of exposure (six catheter segments per test). in addition, selected colonies were subsequently exposed to minocycline and rifampin in broth and examined for selection of minocycline and rifampin resistance (> 28 colonies per selection test). results: inhibitory zones of 14 to 47 mm were observed with s aureus, s epidermidis, e faecalis, and e coli. growth  of p aeruginosa was not inhibited by cvc segments. testing of colonies of the first four organisms at various distances from cvc segments after varying periods of exposure revealed only a single instance of the emergence of resistance (eg, s aureus vs rifampin). recovery of resistant clones was enhanced with minocycline and rifampin broth selection; however, a direct link between cvc exposure and the emergence of resistance was not established. conclusions: our in vitro data suggest that the exposure of gram-positive cocci to either rifampin or minocycline can lead to the development of resistance. however, exposure of bacteria to these antibiotics in combination does not directly lead to resistance. clinical investigations will be required to determine the true risk and implications of the development of resistance.

AB  == purpose: the purpose of our study was to investigate the effect on the growth of  escherichia coli (e. coli), staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) of bupivacaine at a final concentration of 0.77 mg.ml(-1), ropivacaine at 1.2 mg.ml(-1), and sufentanil at 0.38 and 0.5 microg.ml(-1) (alone or in combination with bupivacaine and ropivacaine). methods: the strains were diluted to approximately 3 x 10(4) cfu.ml(-1) in mueller-hinton broth. the anesthetics (0.5 ml) were incubated with the bacterial suspensions (0.5 ml) for 24 hr at 37 degrees c. results: bupivacaine inhibited the growth of e. coli (59 +/- 0.8%; p < 0.05) and s. aureus (22 +/- 3.6%; p < 0.05). ropivacaine also inhibited the growth of e. coli (41 +/- 1.2%; p < 0.05) and s. aureus (25.5 +/- 4.1%; p < 0.05). both anesthetics were ineffective against e. faecalis. sufentanil only inhibited s. aureus (13.8 +/- 3.1%; p < 0.05) at a concentration  of 0.5 microg.ml(-1). sufentanil modified the antibacterial activity of bupivacaine and ropivacaine. it increased the inhibitory effect of bupivacaine on e. faecalis and s. aureus by 10 +/- 2.1% (p < 0.05) and on e. coli by 7% (p < 0.05). sufentanil did not increase the inhibitory effect of ropivacaine on the growth of s. aureus. on the other hand, sufentanil reduced the inhibitory effect  of ropivacaine on e. coli by 11% (p < 0.05). conclusion: both bupivacaine and ropivacaine alone or combined with sufentanil inhibited the growth of e. coli and s. aureus. e. faecalis was partially sensitive to a bupivacaine + sufentanil mixture. sufentanil had a partial synergistic effect on bupivacaine and a partial antagonistic effect on ropivacaine's antibacterial activity.

TI  == cyclic dipeptides exhibit synergistic, broad spectrum antimicrobial effects and have anti-mutagenic properties.
AB  == cyclic dipeptides are known to have antiviral, antibiotic and antitumour properties. the aim of this study was to determine the combined effects of cyclo(l-leucyl-l-prolyl) and cyclo(l-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl) on the growth of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and pathogenic yeasts, as well as determining their anti-mutagenic effects. this drug combination was especially effective against five vre strains: enterococcus faecium (k-99-38), e. faecalis (k-99-17), e. faecalis (k-99-258), e. faecium (k-01-312) and e. faecalis (k-01-511) with mic values of 0.25-1 mg/l. it was also effective against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans with mic values of 0.25-0.5 mg/l. in addition, the cyclic dipeptides exerted anti-mutagenic activity against salmonella typhimurium ta98 and ta100 strains in a salmonella mutation assay. the number of mutant colonies of s. typhimurium strains ta98 and ta100 induced by exposure to af-2 (0.2 microg/plate) decreased in a concentration-dependent manner in the presence of the two cyclic dipeptides (correlation 0.72 and 0.78, respectively). here, for the first time, we report synergistic effects of the cyclic dipeptides [cyclo(l-leu-l-pro) and cyclo(l-phe-l-pro)] in inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, as well as their anti-mutagenic effects in salmonella  strains.

AB  == the treatment of infected tibial nonunion usually includes a staged reconstruction protocol. we present 2 patients with tibial nonunion and plate loosening with oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection. the patients  were treated using the removal of the plate, radical debridement, and implantation of gentamycin-impregnated cement beads during the first stage. during the second stage, plate fixation was performed and tobramycin-impregnated  calcium sulfate (osteoset t) was used as a bone graft substitute. neither an autogenous bone graft nor an allograft was used. at 3 years of follow-up, each tibia showed good union, and there was no recurrence of infection. we consider tobramycin-impregnated calcium sulfate to be an alternative method of bone grafting to treat infected tibial nonunion.

TI  == usnic acid, a natural antimicrobial agent able to inhibit bacterial biofilm formation on polymer surfaces.
AB  == in modern medicine, artificial devices are used for repair or replacement of damaged parts of the body, delivery of drugs, and monitoring the status of critically ill patients. however, artificial surfaces are often susceptible to colonization by bacteria and fungi. once microorganisms have adhered to the surface, they can form biofilms, resulting in highly resistant local or systemic  infections. at this time, the evidence suggests that (+)-usnic acid, a secondary  lichen metabolite, possesses antimicrobial activity against a number of planktonic gram-positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus  faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. since lichens are surface-attached communities that produce antibiotics, including usnic acid, to protect themselves from colonization by other bacteria, we hypothesized that the mode of action of usnic acid may be utilized in the control of medical biofilms. we loaded (+)-usnic acid into modified polyurethane and quantitatively assessed the capacity of (+)-usnic acid to control biofilm formation by either s. aureus or pseudomonas aeruginosa under laminar flow conditions by using image analysis. (+)-usnic acid-loaded polymers did not inhibit the initial attachment of s. aureus cells, but killing the attached cells resulted in the inhibition of biofilm. interestingly, although p. aeruginosa biofilms did form on the surface of (+)-usnic acid-loaded polymer, the morphology of the biofilm was altered, possibly indicating that (+)-usnic acid interfered with signaling pathways.

TI  == heterologous expression of the enterococcal vana operon in methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == two methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, mi-vrsa  and pa-vrsa, and enterococcus faecalis dmc83006b, considered to be the potential  donor of glycopeptide resistance to mi-vrsa, were studied. mi-vrsa is highly resistant to both glycopeptides, whereas pa-vrsa displays low-level resistance to vancomycin and reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin. we have analyzed the expression of the vana operon in the three clinical isolates. determination of the relative amounts of late peptidoglycan precursors and quantification of the d,d-peptidase activities, in the absence or after induction by glycopeptides, revealed that the resistance genes were expressed at similarly high levels in the three strains. glycopeptide resistance stability in the three strains was studied by replica plating. resistance was lost at high frequency, ca. 50%, after overnight growth of pa-vrsa in the absence of antibiotics, whereas it was fully stable in mi-vrsa and e. faecalis dmc83006b. induction of resistance by vancomycin was significantly delayed in pa-vrsa relative to mi-vrsa. low-level glycopeptide resistance of s. aureus pa-vrsa is thus likely due to instability of the genetic element, plasmid or transposon, carrying the vana operon associated with a longer lag phase before growth resumes after induction by vancomycin.

TI  == premature salmonella typhimurium growth inhibition in competition with other gram-negative organisms is redox potential regulated via rpos induction.
AB  == aims: to identify the role of oxidation-reduction (redox) potential in the premature growth inhibition and rpos induction in salmonella serotype typhimurium in competitive growth experiments. methods and results: oxidation-reduction potential was measured throughout the growth of a minority population of salm. typhimurium in mixed cultures with other gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. a lux-based reporter was also used to evaluate rpos activity in salm.  typhimurium in competitor studies. in a mixed culture, the multiplication of a minority population of salm. typhimurium was inhibited when competing gram-negative organisms entered the stationary phase. this was not seen when the  competing flora was gram-positive. the change in redox potential during growth in mixed cultures was closely linked to the inhibition of salm. typhimurium growth by gram-negative competitors. an artificially induced drop in redox potential earlier during growth in mixed cultures with gram-negative organisms reduced the  time to rpos induction in salm. typhimurium and thus inhibited its multiplication prematurely. in contrast, rpos induction and growth inhibition were prevented under high redox potential conditions. conclusions: this work shows that the inhibitory activity of competitive organisms can be mediated through their effect on redox potential-regulated rpos induction. significance and impact of the study: redox potential is shown to be an important determinant of salm. typhimurium growth, an observation with practical implications both for its control and detection.

AB  == bloodstream infection (bsi) is a serious complication of critical illness but it  is uncertain whether acquisition of bsi in the intensive care unit (icu) increases the risk of death. a study was conducted among all calgary health region (population approximately 1 million) adults admitted to icus for 48 h or more during a three-year period to investigate the occurrence, microbiology and risk factors for developing an icu-acquired bsi and to determine whether these infections independently predict mortality. one hundred and ninety-nine icu-acquired bsi episodes occurred during 4933 icu admissions for a cumulative incidence of 4% and an incidence density of 5.4 per 1000 icu days. the most common isolates were staphylococcus aureus (18%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (11%), and enterococcus faecalis (8%); 12% of infections were due to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. admission to the regional neurosurgery/trauma icu [odds ratio (or) 2.86; 95% confidence interval (ci) 2.10-3.90] and increasing acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii (apache ii) score (or 1.05 per point, 95% ci 1.03-1.07) were associated with higher risk, whereas a surgical diagnosis (or 0.69; 95% ci 0.52-0.93) was associated with lower risk of developing icu-acquired bsi in logistic regression  analysis. the crude in-hospital death rate was 45% for patients with icu-acquired bsi compared with 21% for those without (p < 0.0001) development of an icu-acquired bsi was an independent risk factor for death (or 1.79; 95% ci 1.3-2.5) and increases the risk of dying from critical illness.

TI  == newer carbapenems for urinary tract infections.
AB  == four carbapenems have been available clinically in japan. these are imipenem/cilastatin (imip/cs) and panipenem/ betamipron (pani/bp) of the older compounds and newer carbapenems such as biapem (biap) and meropenem (mero). the latter compounds are relatively stable to dehydropeptidase-1 (dhp-1) and have been reported to have higher antimicrobial activities compared to the earlier carbapenems. the antimicrobial activity of these four carbapenems against fresh urinary isolates showed high activities against enterobacteriacae such as serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii and escherichia coli containing the class c-beta-lactamase- and extended spectrum beta-lactamase  (esbl)-producing strains compared to piperacillin (pipc) and ceftazidime (ctaz).  against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the carbapenems, with the exception of panipenem  showed strong antimicrobial activities compared to pipc and ctaz. high activities were also seen against enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, but methicillin-resistant strains were not affected.  the first generation carbapenems showed better activity against e. faecalis than  newer carbapenems. all four carbapenems were similar in clinical effectiveness in double blind trials for complicated urinary tract infections (utis). however, pani/bp is less effective in utis caused by p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. mero showed better eradication rate of p. aeruginosa than imip/cs. retrospective analysis of treated cases using carbapenems showed a rapid defervescence in the treatment of febrile complicated utis, which were mainly caused by mixed infection of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, especially those involving p. aeruginosa and e. faecalis.

TI  == gram-positive mera gene in gram-negative oral and urine bacteria.
AB  == clinical mercury resistant (hg(r)) gram-negative bacteria carrying gram-positive  mercury reductase (mera)-like genes were characterized using dna-dna hybridization, pcr and sequencing. a pcr assay was developed which discriminated  between the mera genes related to staphylococcus and those related to the bacillus/streptococcus mera genes by the difference in size of the pcr product. dna sequence analysis correlated with the pcr assay. the mera genes from acinetobacter junii, enterobacter cloacae and escherichia coli were sequenced and shared 98-99% identical nucleotide (nt) and 99.6-100% amino acid identity with the staphylococcus aureus mera protein. a fourth mera gene, from pantoeae agglomerans, was partially sequenced (60%) and had 99% identical nt and 100% amino acid identity with the streptococcus oralis mera protein. all the hg(r) gram-negative bacteria transferred their gram-positive mera genes to a gram-positive enterococcus faecalis recipient with the resulting transconjugants  expressing mercury resistance. these gram-positive mera genes join gram-positive  tetracycline resistance and gram-positive macrolide resistance genes in their association with mobile elements which are able to transfer and express in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == conservative medical therapy of prosthetic joint infections: retrospective analysis of an 8-year experience.
AB  == successful treatment of prosthetic joint infections often requires multiple surgical interventions and prolonged antimicrobial therapy. however, in certain situations, a surgical approach may not be in the best interest of the patient. a conservative approach was used to treat 34 patients with prosthetic joint infection between 1995 and 2003. diagnosis of infection was based on clinical-microbiological evidence, confirmed by (99)tc-labelled leukocyte scintigraphy, and involved 12 staphylococcus aureus infections, nine staphylococcus epidermidis infections, two enterococcus faecalis infections, two  mixed infections (s. aureus plus pseudomonas aeruginosa; s. epidermidis plus e. faecalis), with the infecting pathogen being unidentified for nine patients. most infections were treated initially with intravenous or intramuscular teicoplanin +/- ciprofloxacin or rifampicin, followed by oral ciprofloxacin or minocycline plus rifampicin. the mean duration of antimicrobial therapy was 41.2 weeks. overall, only three patients did not respond to therapy, and infection was controlled in the remaining 31 patients. among these, no relapse was observed in  17 patients during follow-up for 9-57 months; improvement with early (within 6 months of antibiotic discontinuation) or late relapse was observed in seven and three patients, respectively; two patients improved clinically, but continued to  receive antibiotic therapy; and two patients whose condition improved initially were lost after a 6-month follow-up following discontinuation of antibiotics. no  patient complained of side effects requiring discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. the study confirmed that suppression of infection, with salvage of the infected device in an acceptably functional state, can be achieved in selected cases.

TI  == influence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome on host resistance against bacterial infections.
AB  == objective: to determine the relationship between systemic inflammatory response syndrome (sirs) and host innate immunities against bacterial infections. design:  controlled animal study. setting: university research laboratory. subjects: male  balb/c mice, 8-10 wks of age. interventions: morbidity and mortality rates of severe sirs mice were compared with those of mild sirs mice after infection with  enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) or exposure to infectious complications induced by cecal ligation and puncture (clp). in addition, a function of effector cells related to antibacterial innate  immunities for these infections was analyzed in these two groups. furthermore, scidbgmn mice (scidbg mice depleted of antibacterial effector cells) were reconstituted with effector cells from mild or severe sirs mice and exposed to various infections. measurements and main results: severe sirs mice were greatly  susceptible to e. faecalis, mrsa, and clp-induced sepsis. on the other hand, as compared with normal mice, mild sirs mice were resistant to these infections. all of scidbgmn mice inoculated with peritoneal macrophages (pmphi) from severe sirs  mice died after infection with e. faecalis or mrsa, whereas all scidbgmn mice inoculated with pmphi from mild sirs mice survived after the same infection. scidbgmn mice that were inoculated with pmphi from normal mice and exposed to e.  faecalis, mrsa, or clp survived at rates of 50%, 50%, or 60%, respectively. pmphi from mild sirs mice exhibited typical properties for classically activated macrophages (camphi), whereas those from severe sirs mice exhibited typical properties for alternatively activated macrophages (aamphi). conclusions: mphi-associated host antibacterial innate immunities are greatly influenced by sirs levels. camphi, effector cells for the antibacterial innate immunity against e. faecalis, mrsa, and clp-induced sepsis, are induced in mild sirs mice. aamphi  with no antibacterial capabilities are generated in mice with severe sirs. induction of camphi may protect severe sirs patients against infections.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of five root canal sealers.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the antimicrobial properties of five  endodontic sealers: endo fill, endomethasone, endomethasone n, sealer 26 and ah-plus, against the following microorganisms: candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces naeslundii.  the sealers were tested immediately, 24 h, 48 h and 7 days after manipulation.the direct contact method through the observation of the microbial growth in liquid medium and the agar diffusion test were used to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of the sealers. the results, in both methodologies used, showed that immediately after manipulation, endo-fill and endomethasone demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with no statistically significant difference between them. sealer 26 demonstrated the lowest antimicrobial activity. at all other times after manipulation, there were no statistically significant differences among all the sealers tested. in conclusion, none of the sealers totally inhibited the growth of the microorganisms. furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of each sealer decreased with time and was dependent upon  the microbial susceptibility to them.

TI  == sensitivity of the bact/alert fa-medium for detection of pseudomonas aeruginosa in pre-incubated blood cultures and its temperature-dependence.
AB  == the bact/alert fa-medium was evaluated to detect pseudomonas aeruginosa in pre-incubated blood samples. as published previously its predecessor the bact/alert fan-medium failed to detect p. aeruginosa in delayed entry samples. it is now reported that fa-medium tolerates a longer pre-incubation period at 36 degrees c, i.e. 8 h, before detection of p. aeruginosa fails in experimentally inoculated blood cultures. in clinical blood samples the frequency of false-negative results concerning p. aeruginosa was reduced from 46.9 % (fan-medium) to 9.1 % (fa-medium). if media inoculated with p. aeruginosa are pre-incubated at room temperature for 24 h, false-negative results are not observed. various micro-organisms (haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, candida glabrata) were recognized after pre-incubation at room temperature with similar sensitivity compared to pre-incubation at 36 degrees c. it is concluded that fa-medium detects p. aeruginosa in delayed entry samples with increased sensitivity and pre-incubation at room temperature is superior to pre-incubation  at 36 degrees c.

TI  == nosocomial bloodstream infections in us hospitals: analysis of 24,179 cases from  a prospective nationwide surveillance study.
AB  == background: nosocomial bloodstream infections (bsis) are important causes of morbidity and mortality in the united states. methods: data from a nationwide, concurrent surveillance study (surveillance and control of pathogens of epidemiological importance [scope]) were used to examine the secular trends in the epidemiology and microbiology of nosocomial bsis. results: our study detected 24,179 cases of nosocomial bsi in 49 us hospitals over a 7-year period from march 1995 through september 2002 (60 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions). eighty-seven percent of bsis were monomicrobial. gram-positive organisms caused 65% of these bsis, gram-negative organisms caused 25%, and fungi caused 9.5%. the crude mortality rate was 27%. the most-common organisms causing bsis were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (31% of isolates), staphylococcus aureus  (20%), enterococci (9%), and candida species (9%). the mean interval between admission and infection was 13 days for infection with escherichia coli, 16 days  for s. aureus, 22 days for candida species and klebsiella species, 23 days for enterococci, and 26 days for acinetobacter species. cons, pseudomonas species, enterobacter species, serratia species, and acinetobacter species were more likely to cause infections in patients in intensive care units (p<.001). in neutropenic patients, infections with candida species, enterococci, and viridans  group streptococci were significantly more common. the proportion of s. aureus isolates with methicillin resistance increased from 22% in 1995 to 57% in 2001 (p<.001, trend analysis). vancomycin resistance was seen in 2% of enterococcus faecalis isolates and in 60% of enterococcus faecium isolates. conclusion: in this study, one of the largest multicenter studies performed to date, we found that the proportion of nosocomial bsis due to antibiotic-resistant organisms is increasing in us hospitals.

TI  == use of irradiation to control foodborne pathogens and extend the refrigerated market life of rabbit meat.
AB  == this study set out to evaluate the microbiological status of rabbit meat and the  possibility of using irradiation to control foodborne pathogenic bacteria and extend the refrigerated storage life of meat. rabbit meat samples were gamma irradiated at doses of 0, 1.5 and 3 kgy. the samples were stored at refrigeration temperature, then the effects of irradiation and storage on their microbiological, chemical and sensory properties were studied. irradiation at 1.5 kgy significantly reduced the counts of staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterobacteriaceae but was not enough for complete elimination of salmonella. however, 3 kgy dose reduced the counts of s. aureus, l. monocytogenes, e. faecalis and enterobacteriaceae by more than 3, 3, 1.4 and 4 log units, respectively, while salmonella was not detected. on the other hand, irradiation at 1.5 and 3 kgy significantly reduced the counts of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, psychrophilic bacteria and molds and yeasts and prolonged the refrigerated shelf-life of samples to 12 and 21 days, respectively, compared to 6 days for non-irradiated controls. irradiation of samples significantly increased their amounts of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances  (tbars) but had no significant effects on their total volatile nitrogen (tvn) contents, while storage significantly increased the tbars and tvn for irradiated  and non-irradiated samples. gamma irradiation showed no significant effects on the sensory properties of raw meat. moreover, fried burgers prepared from irradiated rabbit meat showed high sensory acceptability similar to those prepared from non-irradiated meat.

TI  == emerging resistance among bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit--a european and north american surveillance study (2000-2002).
AB  == background: globally icus are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. methods: antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant icu pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from the surveillance network (tsn) databases in europe (france, germany and italy), canada, and the united states (us). results: oxacillin resistance rates among staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. penicillin resistance  rates among streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in germany to as high as 20.2% in the us; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in germany to 3.4% in italy. vancomycin resistance rates among enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in france to 76.3% in the united states. putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production among enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among escherichia coli in the five countries studied. ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower  than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the enterobacteriaceae species examined. fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for e. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). p. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. imipenem was the most active compound tested against acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. conclusion: there was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. compared with other countries, italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of enterococcus spp., which were highest in the us. this data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in europe and north america and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.

TI  == synthesis of mosaic peptidoglycan cross-bridges by hybrid peptidoglycan assembly  pathways in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the peptidoglycan cross-bridges of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis,  and enterococcus faecium consist of the sequences gly(5), l-ala(2), and d-asx, respectively. expression of the fmhb, fema, and femb genes of s. aureus in e. faecalis led to the production of peptidoglycan precursors substituted by mosaic  side chains that were efficiently used by the penicillin-binding proteins for cross-bridge formation. the fem transferases were specific for incorporation of glycyl residues at defined positions of the side chains in the absence of any additional s. aureus factors such as trnas used for amino acid activation. the pbps of e. faecalis displayed a broad substrate specificity because mosaic side chains containing from 1 to 5 residues and gly instead of l-ala at the n-terminal position were used for peptidoglycan cross-linking. low affinity pbp2a of s. aureus conferred beta-lactam resistance in e. faecalis and e. faecium, thereby indicating that there was no barrier to heterospecific expression of resistance caused by variations in the structure of peptidoglycan precursors. thus, conservation of the structure of the peptidoglycan cross-bridges in members of the same species reflects the high specificity of the enzymes for side chain synthesis, although this is not essential for the activity of the pbps.

TI  == domain-domain interactions in the aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance enzyme aac(6')-aph(2'').
AB  == the most common determinant of aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance in gram positive bacterial pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, is a modifying enzyme, aac(6')-aph(2' '), capable of acetylating and phosphorylating a wide range of antibiotics. this enzyme is unique in that it is composed of two separable modification domains, and although a number of studies have been conducted on the acetyltransferase and phosphotransferase activities in isolation, little is known about the role and impact of domain interactions on antibiotic resistance. kinetic analysis and in vivo assessment of a number of n-  and c-terminal truncated proteins have demonstrated that the two domains operate  independently and do not accentuate one another's resistance activity. however, the two domains are structurally integrated, and mutational analysis has demonstrated that a predicted connecting alpha-helix is especially critical for maintaining proper structure and function of both activities. aac(6')-aph(2' ') detoxifies a staggering array of aminoglycosides, where one or both activities make important contributions depending on the antibiotic. thus, to overcome antibiotic resistance associated with aac(6')-aph(2' '), aminoglycosides resistant to modification and/or inhibitors against both activities must be employed. domain-domain interactions in aac(6')-aph(2' ') offer a unique target for inhibitor strategies, as we show that their disruption simultaneously inhibits both activities >90%.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of telavancin (td-6424), a novel bactericidal agent, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == telavancin (td-6424) is a novel lipoglycopeptide that produces rapid and concentration-dependent killing of clinically relevant gram-positive organisms in vitro. the present studies evaluated the in vivo pharmacodynamics of telavancin in the mouse neutropenic thigh (mnt) and mouse subcutaneous infection (msi) animal models. pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies in the mnt model demonstrated that the 24-h area under the concentration-time curve (auc)/mic ratio was the best predictor of efficacy. telavancin produced dose-dependent reduction of thigh titers of several organisms, including methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), penicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis. the 50% effective dose (ed50) estimates for telavancin ranged from 0.5 to 6.6 mg/kg of body weight  (administered intravenously), and titers were reduced by up to 3 log10 cfu/g from pretreatment values. against mrsa atcc 33591, telavancin was 4- and 30-fold more  potent (on an ed50 basis) than vancomycin and linezolid, respectively. against mssa atcc 13709, telavancin was 16- and 40-fold more potent than vancomycin and nafcillin, respectively. telavancin, vancomycin, and linezolid were all efficacious and more potent against mrsa atcc 33591 in the msi model compared to  the mnt model. this deviation in potency was, however, disproportionately greater for vancomycin and linezolid than for telavancin, suggesting that activity of telavancin is less affected by the immune status. the findings of these studies collectively suggest that once-daily dosing of telavancin may provide an effective approach for the treatment of clinically relevant infections with gram-positive organisms.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from belogratchik, bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. with the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum. the cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99, inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, several lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus. clostridium spp., carnobacterium spp., l. mesenteroides and gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (au)/ml, was recorded in mrs broth after 24 h at 30 degrees c. incubation in the presence of protease iv and pronase e resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin st99. no  loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20,  tween 80, urea, triton x-100, n-laurylsarcosin, edta and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. mesentericin st99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees c and after 2 h of incubation at ph 2 to 12. metabolically active cells of l. innocua treated with mesentericin st99 did not undergo lysis. mesentericin st99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain st99. precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by sep-pack c18 chromatography and reverse-phase hplc on a c18 nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == evaluation of the hyplex bloodscreen multiplex pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  == we evaluated the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) system (bag, lich, germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification  of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive bactec 9240 blood culture bottles. the test involves amplification of the bacterial dna by multiplex pcr and subsequent hybridization  of the pcr product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an elisa-based format. the available probes allow the separate detection of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal meca  gene. the hyplex bloodscreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (s. aureus, 100%; s. epidermidis, 97.2%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). the specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (escherichia coli, 92.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; klebsiella spp., 100%; enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; s. aureus, 100%, s. epidermidis, 97.7%; enterococcus faecalis/enterococcus  faecium, 99.6%; streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). the result of the meca gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of staphylococcus aureus investigated. in conclusion, the hyplex bloodscreen pcr-elisa system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the meca gene of staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.

TI  == antimicrobial potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 against selected bacteria.
AB  == immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. this study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. l. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. the antimicrobial potential of immobilized l. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, salmonella, and staphylococcus aureus) or  pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized l. lactis inhibited the growth of s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus sakei, kocuria varians, and pediococcus acidilactici. only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. with the addition of 10 mm of a chelating agent (edta) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of e. coli; however, p. putida and salmonella typhi were unaffected by this treatment. these results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial  growth in semisolid synthetic media.

TI  == relationship between antibacterial activity of chitosan and surface characteristics of cell wall.
AB  == aim: five representative waterborne pathogens were used to illustrate the relationship between chitosan's antibacterial activity and the surface characteristics of the bacterial cell wall. methods: chitosan was prepared with averaged 75% or 95% deacetylated degree to examine its antibacterial activity against waterborne pathogens. fresh microbial inoculants for the antibacterial assessment were prepared on nutrient agar at 37 degrees for 24 h. the evaluation  items of antibacterial mechanism included hydrophilicity and negative charge analysis of cell surface, and adsorptive characteristics of chitosan to bacterial cell. all the experiments were applied in triplicate tests at least. results: although cell wall hydrophilicity was similar among gram-negative bacteria, the distribution of negative charge on their cell surfaces was quite different. more  negatively charged cell surfaces had a greater interaction with chitosan, a phenomenon further confirmed by transmission electron micrography (tem). conclusion: results showed the hydrophilicity in gram-negative bacteria was much  higher than in gram-positive ones. the correlation coefficient 0.988 between the  amount of absorbed chitosan and its inhibition efficiency indicated a close relationship.

AB  == streptococcus salivarius is a usual commensal of skin, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, oral cavity and paranasal sinuses. although it is usually considered to have low virulence, s. salivarius may cause life-threatening infections, particularly endocarditis. on the other hand, bacterial meningitis after spinal anesthesia is very rare, there being some reported cases caused by s. salivarius, s. mitis, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. we report a 57 year old man who developed meningitis symptoms within 10 h of an uncomplicated inguinal herniorrhaphy performed during spinal anesthesia. cerebrospinal cultures grew s. salivarius sensitive to penicillin. the patient was successfully treated with penicillin g and left the hospital without sequelae. in the literature, bacterial meningitis due to s. salivarius is rarely  reported. of the 28 cases, 18 occurred after lumbar puncture for diagnostic or for spinal anesthesia, 5 occurred following a bacteriemia for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or intestinal neoplasia, and the other 5 in patients who had dural defects. we discuss the possible etiological causes of the meningitis due to s. salivarius cases reports. the early recognition of this entity and the aseptic precautions likely to reduce the incidence of infectious complications after lumbar puncture are stressed.

TI  == virulence potential of the staphylococcal adhesin cna in experimental arthritis is determined by its affinity for collagen.
AB  == background: staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of bacterial arthritis, which  often results in severe joint damage. cna, a collagen adhesin of s. aureus, was shown to be a virulence factor in several animal models. however, the precise molecular mechanism by which cna contributes to virulence remains unclear. methods: we examined the role of the collagen-binding function of cna in a mouse  model of septic arthritis by comparing the virulence of isogenic strains of s. aureus expressing (1) wild-type cna, (2) a truncated form of cna (cna35) with a higher affinity for collagen than the wild type, (3) cna35 containing a single point mutation resulting in loss of collagen binding, (4) cna lacking the collagen-binding domain, and (5) the collagen-binding domain of ace (adhesin of collagen from enterococcus faecalis). results and conclusions: the results provide, for the first time, direct evidence that the virulence of cna depends on its collagen-binding ability. collagen binding facilitated early colonization of  the joints of mice. furthermore, the virulence potential of the adhesin is determined by the adhesin's affinity for its ligand, as well as its binding kinetics.

AB  == vancomycin resistance in enterococci, predominantly enterococcus faecium, developed in the latter half of the 1980s, and the long anticipated development of vancomycin resistance in staphylococcus aureus has now occurred. a number of vancomycin-intermediate strains have been described, and these strains have abnormal, thickened cell walls in the presence of vancomycin. two mechanisms of resistance have been described in the strains: affinity trapping of vancomycin molecules by cell wall monomers and clogging of the outer layers of peptidoglycan by bound vancomycin molecules, and change in the structure or metabolism of teichoic acids. of more serious concern has been the description in 2002 of two patients with vancomycin-resistant s aureus infections. in one instance, the patient had skin lesions coinfected with vancomycin resistant, vana genotype, e faecalis, and the vana resistance genes could have been transferred to the s aureus strain. expression of resistance was high in one s aureus strain and low in the other, making detection more challenging in the latter instance. these developments are of great concern, and every effort should be made to prevent further development and spread of vancomycin resistance in staphylococci.

AB  == an extended volsurf approach, that additionally includes shape descriptors, was applied to a dataset of 55 quinolones. bactericidal activity was measured at bayer ag, germany, for gram-negative (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis). chemometric analysis was first approached via a classical volsurf approach. the following descriptors were found most important: bactericidal activity particularly increases with high values of the best volume (bv11(oh2)) and the minimum energy (emin1(oh2)) of the water probe, high values of the integy moment (id(dry)) of the lipophilic probe, and high values of the hydrophilic region (w(o)) of the hydrogen bond acceptor probe. best volume (bv31(oh2)) of the water probe and best volume (bv12(dry)) and lipophilic regions (d(dry)) of the lipophilic probe as well as h-bonding capacity derived with the co probe (hb(o))  are inversely related to activity. pls analysis yields a five-component model with an r(2) of 0.83 and a q(2) of 0.43 after variable selection via fractional factorial design (ffd). chemometric modeling could be improved by including newly derived shape descriptors, which were merged with the volsurf descriptors and subjected to pls analysis. the global model of this extended volsurf approach is  optimal with two components and exhibits a significantly improved statistical quality; a marginally reduced r(2) (0.75 versus 0.83) is more than compensated by a highly improved predictivity with a q(2) of 0.63 versus 0.43. to prove model quality, external prediction of seven test set quinolones was performed. the precise prediction of all test set molecules nicely demonstrates the robustness and statistical significance of the obtained chemometric model using the extended volsurf approach.

TI  == glycopeptide resistance in staphylococcus aureus: is it a real threat?
AB  == following the discovery in 1992 that resistance to vancomycin could be transferred in vitro from a strain of staphylococcus haemolyticus to staphylococcus aureus, the threat that a similar event could happen in vivo has existed. in 1996, the threat became a reality in japan followed by reports of low-level heteroresistant s. aureus from elsewhere in the world. however, the threat has not gone away; indeed it has become more intimidating within the past  2 years with the isolation of higher-level resistance to vancomycin transferred on a plasmid from enterococcus faecalis. the mechanisms of resistance are different in each of the types of s. aureus with reduced susceptibility to the glycopeptides: in one hetero-vancomycin intermediate-susceptible s. aureus (hvisa) and vancomycin intermediate-susceptible s. aureus (visa), cell wall biosynthesis is altered, hindering glycopeptide reaching its target, and in the other vancomycin-resistant s. aureus (vrsa) the target is altered. this review attempts to place into context the threat posed to patients by the appearance of  strains of s. aureus more resistant to one of the key therapeutic agents used in  our hospitals. it will do so by raising a number of important questions followed  by the presentation of experimental evidence that may or may not provide answers  that heighten or lower the threat.

TI  == omega-pyridiniumalkylethers of steroidal phenols: new compounds with potent antibacterial and antiproliferative activities.
AB  == novel omega-pyridiniumalkylethers of two steroidal phenols were synthesized as compounds with potential antimicrobial activity. 3-hydroxy-estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-17-one and 1-hydroxy-4-methyl-estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-17-one were reacted with omega,omega'-dibromoalkanes to omega-bromoalkoxy-estra-1,3,5(10)-trienes followed by reaction with pyridine to obtain the desired steroidal omega-pyridiniumalkoxy  compounds as bromides. their antimicrobial activity against strains of multiresistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), a vancomycin resistant enterococcus  faecalis and fast growing mycobacteria depends clearly on the length of the alkyl chain. a strong broadband activity has been found for the compounds with eight or 10 c-atoms; in some cases better than ciprofloxacin or cetylpyridinium salts. in  addition, the antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity depends on the chain length, too. the differentiation between antibacterial and cytotoxic activity is  better for the steroid hybrid molecules than the cetylpyridinium salts. these new compounds can serve as lead compounds for further optimization.

TI  == [vancomycin resistant enterococci in the netherlands].
AB  == enterococci (enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium) are relatively avirulent enteric bacteria that usually only cause infections in immunocompromised patients. antimicrobial treatment, however, is hampered as enterococci are intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics. for years, vancomycin was considered the last available antibiotic. plasmid-mediated resistance against vancomycin among enterococci was first described in the nineteen-eighties and since then incidences of infection caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) have increased dramatically, especially in the united states. in 2000, three outbreaks of vre occurred in hospitals in the netherlands and a set of infection-control measures was proposed to limit further transmission. these measures were based on the simultaneous isolation of vre from multiple patients. all three outbreaks were controlled by these measures and no new outbreaks in dutch hospitals have been reported since then. epidemiological studies have shown that hospital outbreaks on three continents were caused by a subpopulation of e. faecium, which is characterized by the presence of a potential virulence gene (variant esp) and resistance to amoxicillin. this 'hospital strain' of e. faecium has probably been prevalent within hospital settings for some time, but only became clinically relevant when it had acquired  vancomycin-resistance. current advice is to implement the set of infection control measures formulated in 2000, only in those patients colonized by amoxicillin-resistant vre. the potential dangers of vre were recently underlined  by the proven transmission of the vancomycin-resistance gene from vre to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in two patients in the united  states. it is in the interest of the patients that prevalence of vre and mrsa in  dutch hospitals should be kept as low as possible.

TI  == sensitization of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to jenseniin g by sublethal injury.
AB  == jenseniin g, a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium thoenii p126, is active  against related propionibacteria and some lactic acid bacteria and is sporostatic to botulinal spores. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sublethal stress on jenseniin g activity. bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica were subjected to temperature, acid, and osmotic stresses in the presence of jenseniin g. the bacteriocin reduced the viability of sublethally injured cultures, although the extent of reduction varied with strain and treatment. e. faecalis was the most sensitive to temperature stress; no reduction of viable counts occurred in the absence of jenseniin g, and a 1.5-log reduction occurred in the presence of jenseniin g. b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. aureus were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to heat stress than when exposed to cold stress, whereas e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and s. flexneri were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to cold stress than when exposed to heat stress. when comparing an acid stress test alone to a combination of acid stress and jenseniin g, e. faecalis and l. monocytogenes showed the greatest sensitivities with 4.87- and 2.82-log reductions, respectively, after 7 days. all cultures except for s. aureus were adversely affected by the combination of salt stress and jenseniin g. salmonella typhimurium showed the greatest sensitivity to salt stress with jenseniin g (a 1.54-log reduction at day 7) when compared to salt stress alone (a 0.55-log reduction at day 7). jenseniin g, like bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive species, has broader activity against stressed organisms.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in the united states in 2002.
AB  == background: bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. antimicrobial susceptibility patterns should guide the choice of empiric antimicrobial regimens for patients with bacteremia. methods: from january to december of 2002, 82,569 bacterial blood culture isolates were reported to the surveillance network (tsn) database-usa by 268 laboratories. susceptibility to relevant antibiotic compounds was analyzed using national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. results: coagulase-negative staphylococci (42.0%), staphylococcus aureus (16.5%), enterococcus faecalis (8.3%), escherichia coli (7.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.6%), and enterococcus faecium (3.5%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures, collectively accounting for >80% of isolates. in vitro susceptibility to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone were high for oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (98.7%), oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus (99.8%), e. coli (97.3%), k. pneumoniae (93.3%),  and streptococcus pneumoniae (97.2%). susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones were variable for k. pneumoniae (90.3-91.4%), e. coli (86.0-86.7%), oxacillin-susceptible s. aureus (84.0-89.4%), oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (72.7-82.7%), e. faecalis (52.1%), and e. faecium (11.3%). combinations of antimicrobials are often prescribed as empiric therapy for bacteremia. susceptibilities of all blood culture isolates to one or  both agents in combinations of ceftriaxone, ceftazdime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin were consistent (range,  74.8-76.3%) but lower than similar beta-lactam or ciprofloxacin combinations with vancomycin (range, 93.5-96.6%). conclusion: ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility remains essential, and will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland 2001-2002: the bsac bacteraemia resistance surveillance programme.
AB  == objectives: to describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the uk and ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. methods: in 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the uk and ireland. a single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured mics by the bsac agar dilution method. results: oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group b isolates (82% resistant). nine  percent of s. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (mics 0.12-1 mg/l), but none required >/=2 mg/l for inhibition. high-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin mics (>/=32 mg/l), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of enterococcus faecium. vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of e. faecium, 3% of e. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, mic of 8 mg/l). escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of e. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of klebsiella spp. and 8% of enterobacter spp. resistance rates of pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in gram-positive organisms. ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. mics of tigecycline were low for gram-positive species and enterobacteriaceae except proteeae and enterobacter spp. conclusion: antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. an important exception was oxacillin resistance in s. aureus.

AB  == tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from april 2002 to march 2003 were investigated in a multicenter study in  japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 334 strains were  isolated from 131 (75.3%) of 174 patients with surgical infections. one hundred and seventy-one strains were isolated from primary infections, and 163 strains were isolated from post-operative infections. from primary infections, anaerobic  gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation  rate of e. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this  order, and from postoperative infections, e. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and citobacter freundii. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the  last several years. we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci nor p. aeruginosa producing metallo-beta-lactamase. but we noticed cefazolin-resistant e. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase.

TI  == commensal gram-negative bacteria prime human dendritic cells for enhanced il-23 and il-27 expression and enhanced th1 development.
AB  == dendritic cells (dc) are the main orchestrators of specific immune responses. depending on microbial information they encounter in peripheral tissues, they promote the development of th1, th2 or unpolarized th cell responses. in this study we have investigated the immunomodulatory effect of non-pathogenic intestinal gram-negative (escherichia coli, bacteroides vulgatus,veillonella parvula, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive (bifidobacterium adolescentis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus plantarum and staphylococcus aureus) bacteria on human monocyte-derived dc (modc). none of the gram-positive bacteria  (gpb) primed for th1 or th2 development. in contrast, despite the low levels of il-12 they induce, all gram-negative bacteria (gnb) primed modc for enhanced th1  cell development, which was dependent on il-12 and an additional unidentified cofactor. strikingly, gnb-matured modc expressed elevated levels of p19 and p28 mrna, the critical subunits of il-23 and il-27, respectively, suggesting that the il-12 family members may jointly be responsible for their th1-driving capacity. purified major cell wall components of either gnb or gpb did not yield th cell profiles identical to those obtained with whole bacteria, and could not explain the induction of the il-12 family members nor th1 priming by gnb. importantly, this study gives indications that the expression of the different il-12 family members is dictated by different priming conditions of immature dc.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetics of ac98-6446, a novel cyclic glycopeptide,  in experimental infection models.
AB  == ac98-6446 is a novel semisynthetic derivative of a natural product related to the mannopeptimycins produced by streptomyces hygroscopicus. naturally occurring esterified mannopeptimycins exhibited excellent in vitro activity but only moderate in vivo efficacy against staphylococcal infection. the in vivo efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of ac98-6446 were investigated in murine acute lethal, bacterial thigh and rat endocarditis infections. pharmacokinetics were performed  in mice, rats, monkeys, and dogs. acute lethal infections were performed with several gram-positive isolates: staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococci), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the 50% effective dose for all isolates tested ranged from 0.05 to 0.39 mg/kg of body weight after intravenous (i.v.) administration. vancomycin was more than fivefold less efficacious against all of these same infections. results of the thigh infection with s. aureus showed a static dose for ac98-6446 of 0.4 mg/kg by i.v.  administration. reduction of counts in the thigh of >2 log(10) cfu were achieved  with doses of 1 mg/kg. i.v. administration of 3 mg/kg twice a day for 3 days resulted in a >3 log(10) reduction in bacterial counts of vancomycin-susceptible  and -resistant e. faecalis in a rat endocarditis model. pharmacokinetics of ac98-6446 showed an increase in exposure (area under the concentration-time curve) from mouse to dog species. the i.v. half-life (t(1/2)) increased threefold between rodents and the higher species dosed. efficacy of ac98-6446 has been demonstrated in several models of infection with resistant gram-positive pathogens. this glycopeptide exhibited bactericidal activity in these models, resulting in efficacy at low doses with reduction in bacterial load.

TI  == comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492.
AB  == objectives: the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, abt-492, was determined. methods: mics were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. the effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. results: mic data indicate that abt-492 has potent activity against gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant enterococcus faecalis but not enterococcus  faecium. abt-492 was the most active agent tested against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. good activity was observed for abt-492 amongst the enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of proteus, morganella and providencia, as well as  for pseudomonas spp. in common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms  with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised mic(90)s to abt-492. the  one isolate of h. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an abt-492 mic close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. abt-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against chlamydia spp. an inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, e. faecium, klebsiella spp. and  escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised mics in the presence of 70% serum protein. the clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. conclusions: abt-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.

TI  == calcium-supplemented daptomycin etest strips for susceptibility testing on iso-sensitest agar.
AB  == objective: iso-sensitest agar (isa), which is recommended by the bsac for routine susceptibility testing of staphylococci and enterococci, contains insufficient calcium for testing daptomycin. isotonic agar supplemented with 50 mg/l calcium has been advocated, but is not routinely available in many laboratories. we evaluated a daptomycin etest that incorporates a constant level of calcium throughout the daptomycin gradient, designed to give an appropriate concentration around the strip during testing, as an alternative for susceptibility testing on  isa. methods: ninety-one isolates of staphylococcus aureus (45 methicillin-susceptible, 46 methicillin-resistant) and 90 enterococci (47 enterococcus faecalis, 43 enterococcus faecium) were tested. daptomycin etest mics were determined on isa, whereas agar dilution mics were determined in parallel on isotonic agar supplemented with calcium to 50 mg/l as a control. results: the agar dilution and etest mic ranges of daptomycin for s. aureus were  0.25-1 mg/l (mode 0.5 mg/l), and 0.125-2 mg/l (mode 0.25 mg/l), respectively. the corresponding mic values for enterococci were 0.25-4 mg/l (mode, 1 mg/l) and 0.125-4 mg/l (mode, 2 mg/l). for staphylococci, 86% of the etest mic results were within one dilution of the agar dilution values, and for enterococci, 90% of the  etest mic results met these criteria. when results from the two methods were not  identical, there was a tendency for the etest mic values to be lower than the agar dilution values. conclusions: this study shows that calcium-supplemented daptomycin etests on isa are an accurate and convenient alternative to calcium-supplemented isotonic agar.

TI  == antibacterial effects of carica papaya fruit on common wound organisms.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to investigate antibacterial activity of ripe and unripe carica papaya on selected micro-organisms. cultures of micro-organisms were routinely maintained in nutrient agar slants at 4 degrees c. extracts of immature, mature and ripe carica papaya fruit were obtained by separately grinding factions of the epicarp, endocarp and seeds and filtering them through gauze. sensitivity tests were conducted by adding 0.06 ml of extract to agar wells (6 mm diameter) prepared from 20 ml agar seeded with 10(6) cells/ml suspension of one of the eight organisms per plate. the inoculated plates were allowed to equilibrate at 4 degrees c for 1 hour, incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 hours, and zones of inhibition measured in millimetres. anti-bacterial activity was expressed in terms of the radius of zone of inhibition. seed extracts from the fruit showed inhibition in the following order: b cereus > e coli > s faecalis > s aureus > p vulgaris > s flexneri. no significant difference was found in bacterial sensitivity between immature, mature and ripe fruits. no inhibition zone was produced by epicarp and endocarp extracts. carica papaya seeds contain anti-bacterial activity that inhibits growth of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. observed activity was independent of stage of fruit maturity. carica papaya has antibacterial effects that could be useful in treating chronic skin ulcers to promote healing.

TI  == urinary bactericidal activity, urinary excretion and plasma concentrations of gatifloxacin (400 mg) versus ciprofloxacin (500 mg) in healthy volunteers after a single oral dose.
AB  == in an open randomised double-crossover study 12 volunteers (six men, six women) received a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400 mg) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) to assess urinary bactericidal activity (in eight intervals up to 120 h) and pharmacokinetic (pk) parameters (up to 36 h). plasma concentrations and urinary excretion were determined by hplc with fluorescence detection, and urinary bactericidal titers (ubt) by microdilution-method, using antibiotic-free urine of each volunteer. the mean maximum plasma concentration of gatifloxacin was 3.35 mg/l and that of ciprofloxacin 2.12 mg/l. the mean (median) cumulative renal excretion of the parent drug was for gatifloxacin 81 (83)% of the administered dose within 120 h and for ciprofloxacin 43 (45)%. the ubts, i.e. the highest two-fold dilution (antibiotic-free urine as diluent) of urine still being bactericidal, were determined for an escherichia coli atcc reference strain and nine clinical uropathogens with the following mics (mg/l) for gatifloxacin/ciprofloxacin (microdilution, mhb): e. coli atcc 25922 (0.008/0.008); e. coli 523 (0.06/0.06); klebsiella pneumoniae 1058 (0.03/0.016);  proteus mirabilis 524 (0.125/0.016); pseudomonas aeruginosa 561 (1/0.125); enterococcus faecalis strains 60 an 55 (0.5/1 and 8/32); staphylococcus aureus strains 248 and 596 (both 0.03/0.125) and s. saprophyticus ho94 (0.125/0.25). the median ubts measured within the first 6h for gatifloxacin were between 1:16 and 1:>or=1024 for the gram-negative strains including p. aeruginosa and between 1:8  and 1:>or=1024 for the five gram-positive strains. the median ubts for ciprofloxacin were between 1:64 and 1:>or=1024 for the gram-negative strains (incl p. aeruginosa) and between 1:1.5 and 1:768 for the five gram-positive strains. the ubts up to 12 < 0.05 h showed no difference (p<0.05 ) for both e. coli strains, but ciprofloxacin was superior to gatifloxacin against klebsiella,  proteus and pseudomonas strains and gatifloxacin was superior to ciprofloxacin against all gram-positive strains. for the ubts at 12-24 h, gatifloxacin was generally superior to ciprofloxacin, but showed no difference in the proteus and  pseudomonas strains. the areas under the ubt-time-curve (aubt) up to 120 h showed statistically significant (p ) differences between both quinolones in favour of gatifloxacin against 8 of 10 strains tested, no difference for p. mirabilis and significantly higher activity of ciprofloxacin against p. aeruginosa. in conclusion, gatifloxacin and ciprofloxacin had overall comparable initial urinary bactericidal activity with some differences for specific pathogens, some times in favour of gatifloxacin (gram-positives) and some times of ciprofloxacin (usually  gram-negatives), suggesting that for empiric therapy a single oral dose of gatifloxacin (400mg) would be clinically equivalent to ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily-in agreement with the results of a clinical study in complicated uti  performed previously [int. j. antimicrob. agents (2004)].

TI  == activity of linezolid against gram-positive cocci isolated in french hospitals as determined by three in-vitro susceptibility testing methods.
AB  == in total, 844 strains of gram-positive cocci were collected from six university hospitals in france between september 1999 and january 2000. mics of linezolid were determined: (i) for all strains by agar dilution (method a); (ii) by broth microdilution (method b) for staphylococci and enterococci; (iii) by etest (method e) for beta-haemolytic streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae. susceptibility to other antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method.  mic50 and mic90 values were identical (2 mg/l) for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (n = 179) by methods a and b. linezolid was active against  methicillin-resistant s. aureus (n = 117), with an mic90 of 2 mg/l (methods a and b), but with a lower mic50 of 1 mg/l by method a. of the 200 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 56.5% were methicillin-resistant and 43.5% were methicillin-susceptible. linezolid had similar in-vitro activity by methods a and b (mic50 and mic90 values of 1-2 mg/l), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility. the mic90 of linezolid for all enterococci (150 enterococcus faecalis and 50 enterococcus faecium) was 2 mg/l by both methods. mics of linezolid for beta-haemolytic streptococci had a narrow range of 0.5-2 mg/l (method a) and 0.125-2 mg/l (method e). pneumococci (n = 118), including 67 penicillin g-intermediate and -resistant strains, were all inhibited by linezolid 2 mg/l (mic90 of 2 mg/l by methods a and e). no strain had an mic of > 2 mg/l by  agar dilution or etest, or of > 4 mg/l by broth microdilution. overall, the study confirmed the good in-vitro activity of linezolid and the very narrow range of mics for gram-positive cocci susceptible or resistant to other antibiotics, irrespective of the method used.

TI  == [nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first ciproxan iv special investigation in 2001].
AB  == the parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (cpfx), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in september 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. as a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this  drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx. this time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including cpfx against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to cpfx with those to other antimicrobial drugs. gram-positive bacteria  were less susceptible to cpfx than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), staphylococcus epidermidis  and enterococcus faecalis to cpfx were comparable to those to cefozopran. susceptibility of streptococcus pneumoniae to cpfx did not differ among ampicillin (abpc)-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (mic of abpc: < 0.25 microgram/ml), abpc-intermediate s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and abpc-resistant s. pneumoniae (mic of abpc: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) mic90 of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with cpfx. gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to cpfx similarly to carbapenems and the mic90 values of cpfx were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except stenotrophomonas maltophilia and burkholderia cepacia. pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to cpfx among the antibacterial drugs examined and the mic90 was 2 micrograms/ml. cpfx also showed the lowest mic90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant p. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. when extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production and class b beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of  glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing esbl and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class b beta-lactamase were found. the mic range of cpfx to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (mic of cpfx: 1 microgram/ml) based on the nccls breakpoint. cpfx also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of japan society of chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. furthermore, susceptibilities  of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we  conducted in 1997. thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of cpfx was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.

TI  == new antibacterial agents derived from the dna gyrase inhibitor cyclothialidine.
AB  == cyclothialidine (1, ro 09-1437) is a potent dna gyrase inhibitor that was isolated from streptomyces filipinensis nr0484 and is a member of a new family of natural products. it acts by competitively inhibiting the atpase activity exerted by the b subunit of dna gyrase but barely exhibits any growth inhibitory activity against intact bacterial cells, presumably due to insufficient permeation of the  cytoplasmic membrane. to explore the antibacterial potential of 1, we developed a flexible synthetic route allowing for the systematic modification of its structure. from a first set of analogues, structure-activity relationships (sar)  were established for different substitution patterns, and the 14-hydroxylated, bicyclic core (x) of 1 seemed to be the structural prerequisite for dna gyrase inhibitory activity. the variation of the lactone ring size, however, revealed that activity can be found among 11- to 16-membered lactones, and even seco-analogues were shown to maintain some enzyme inhibitory properties, thereby  reducing the minimal structural requirements to a rather simple, hydroxylated benzyl sulfide (xi). on the basis of these "minimal structures" a modification program afforded a number of inhibitors that showed in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria. the best activities were displayed by 14-membered lactones, and representatives of this subclass exhibit excellent and broad in vitro antibacterial activity against gram-positive pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and enterococcus faecalis, and overcome resistance against clinically used drugs. by improving the pharmacokinetic properties of the most active compounds (94, 97), in particular by lowering their lipophilic properties, we were able to identify congeners of cyclothialidine (1) that showed efficacy in vivo.

AB  == ac98-6446 is a novel semisynthetic cyclic glycopeptide antibiotic related to the  natural product mannopeptimycin alpha (ac98-1). in the present study the activity of ac98-6446 was evaluated against a variety of recent clinical gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains. ac98-6446 demonstrated similar potent activities against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococci and glycopeptide-intermediate staphylococcal isolates (mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [mic(90)s], 0.03 to 0.06 microg/ml). ac98-6446 also demonstrated good activities against both vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible strains of enterococci (mic(90)s, 0.12 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively) as well as against streptococcal strains (mic(90)s, <or= 0.008 to 0.03 microg/ml). ac98-6446 demonstrated bactericidal activity in terms of the reduction in the viable counts (>3 log(10) cfu/ml) of staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates and a marked decrease in the viable counts of most enterococcal strains (from 0.2 to 2.5 log(10) cfu/ml). unlike vancomycin, which demonstrates time-dependent killing, ac98-6446 demonstrated concentration-dependent killing. the potent activity, novel structure, and bactericidal activity demonstrated by ac98-6446 make it an attractive candidate for further development.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activities of new bis-benzimidazoles.
AB  == twenty bis-benzimidazole derivatives were synthesised by the reaction of benzimidazole with appropriate alkyl halides. the compounds synthesised were identified by 1h, 13c-nmr, ft-ir and micro analysis. all compounds studied in this work were screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against standard strains; enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), escherichia coli (atcc 25922) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853). ten of the compounds were found effective to inhibit the growth of gram-positive  bacteria (e. faecalis and s. aureus) at mic (minimal inhibitory concentration) values between 50-400 microg/ ml. two of the compounds showed mic values of 200 microg/ml against gram-negative bacteria (e. coli and p. aeruginosa).

TI  == molecular and clinical epidemiology of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == objectives: with the recent emergence of vancomycin-resistant (vr) staphylococcus aureus, subsequent to the suggested transfer of the vana resistance gene from enterococcus faecalis, we sought to determine risk factors for acquisition of vr  e. faecalis and to evaluate the molecular epidemiology of this less-prevalent and less-studied species of vr enterococcus. methods: we compared clinical isolates of vr e. faecalis from 71 patients, collected over 12 years in a large community  teaching hospital, with isolates from 126 patients with vancomycin-susceptible e. faecalis. results: risk factors for vr e. faecalis acquisition by multivariate analysis were nursing home residence (p = 0.0005), haemodialysis (p = 0.009), decubitus ulcers (p = 0.03) and receipt of parenteral vancomycin (p = 0.0002). twenty-one percent of vr e. faecalis demonstrated vana and 79% vanb resistance. the number of vana isolates increased over time. molecular analysis showed vana or vanb in multiple pfge groups. conclusions: the results of this study suggest gene dissemination among some isolates and intra-hospital spread of other isolates. the risk factors identified clearly suggest that vr e. faecalis is a nosocomial pathogen and should be considered in infection control practices. further surveillance of vr e. faecalis is warranted, due to the potential spread  of vancomycin resistance among enterococci and staphylococci.

TI  == role of class a penicillin-binding proteins in pbp5-mediated beta-lactam resistance in enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == peptidoglycan polymerization complexes contain multimodular penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) of classes a and b that associate a conserved c-terminal transpeptidase module to an n-terminal glycosyltransferase or morphogenesis module, respectively. in enterococcus faecalis, class b pbp5 mediates intrinsic resistance to the cephalosporin class of beta-lactam antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone. to identify the glycosyltransferase partner(s) of pbp5, combinations of deletions were introduced in all three class a pbp genes of e. faecalis jh2-2  (pona, pbpf, and pbpz). among mutants with single or double deletions, only jh2-2 deltapona deltapbpf was susceptible to ceftriaxone. ceftriaxone resistance was restored by heterologous expression of pbpf from enterococcus faecium but not by  mgt encoding the monofunctional glycosyltransferase of staphylococcus aureus. thus, pbp5 partners essential for peptidoglycan polymerization in the presence of beta-lactams formed a subset of the class a pbps of e. faecalis, and heterospecific complementation was observed with an ortholog from e. faecium. site-directed mutagenesis of pbpf confirmed that the catalytic serine residue of  the transpeptidase module was not required for resistance. none of the three class a pbp genes was essential for viability, although deletion of the three genes led to an increase in the generation time and to a decrease in peptidoglycan cross-linking. as the e. faecalis chromosome does not contain any additional glycosyltransferase-related genes, these observations indicate that glycan chain polymerization in the triple mutant is performed by a novel type of  glycosyltransferase. the latter enzyme was not inhibited by moenomycin, since deletion of the three class a pbp genes led to high-level resistance to this glycosyltransferase inhibitor.

TI  == worldwide assessment of dalbavancin activity and spectrum against over 6,000 clinical isolates.
AB  == continuing emergence of new antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and the increased frequency of existing resistances, requires the development of alternative antimicrobial agents. dalbavancin is an amide glycopeptide derivative with a markedly extended serum elimination half-life. dalbavancin and selected comparators were tested against 6,339 recent clinical isolates (2002) from the americas and europe using reference susceptibility testing methods. the general characteristics of this gram-positive organism collection were: oxacillin (oxa)-resistant staphylococcus aureus (orsa) at 39% of strains; vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) at 10%; and penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci at 28%. the overall distribution of dalbavancin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values ranged from < or = 0.015 to > 32 microg/ml, but > 99%  of mic results were at < or =1 microg/ml. s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci were extremely susceptible to dalbavancin (mic90, 0.06 microg/ml) despite resistance patterns to other agents. dalbavancin was the most potent compound (by weight) against vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis and e.  faecium (mic90, 0.06 and 0.12 microg/ml, respectively); however, vre strains showed decreased dalbavancin susceptibility (mic50, 4 or 8 microg/ml). all streptococcal isolates were inhibited at < or =0.25 microg/ml of dalbavancin. this reported dalbavancin activity indicates that the new glycopeptide has significant activity, superior to available agents in the class, and a potency that was uniform across geographically sampled organisms. some vre were inhibited by very low dalbavancin concentrations (< or = 1 microg/ml; van b phenotypes). further clinical development seems warranted for this once-weekly administered agent.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == cell density--dependent regulation: basic principles and effects on the virulence of gram-positive cocci.
AB  == principles: quorum sensing (qs) regulation appears to be a consequence of interbacterial communication by which bacteria of one or even different species learn about their current population density and react in a defined way to that information. qs-regulation is a three step process: in the first step specific signaling molecules are produced and secreted to the exterior space. in the second step, the molecules accumulate e.g. with growing population density. in the last step, a supra-threshold concentration of the molecules is extra- or intra-cellularly sensed by the bacteria and leads to a cascade of regulatory activities. while gram-negative bacteria can employ five or more different chemical classes of signaling molecules, gram-positive cocci predominantly use special oligopeptides for specific signaling. descriptions: examples of qs-regulatory effects on virulence factor expression in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis are given. in these bacteria, qs-regulation appears to be crucial for displaying tissue invasiveness and/or biofilm formation. applications: the high specificity of the initial signal sensing and the importance for expressing special virulence traits make this type of gene expression control a promising target for the development of novel therapeutics. the options for such therapies are critically discussed based on practical experiences with interference in s. aureus qs-regulation.

TI  == comparison of oxidative stress induced by ciprofloxacin and pyoverdin in bacteria and in leukocytes to evaluate toxicity.
AB  == oxidative stress induced by ciprofloxacin and pyoverdin, a leukotoxic pigment, was studied by comparing their effect in bacteria and leukocytes. chemiluminescence (cl) assays with lucigenin or luminol were adapted to measure the stimuli of superoxide anion (o2 -) and other reactive species of oxygen (ros) in bacteria. ciprofloxacin principally induced the production of o2 - in the three species studied: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and escherichia coli. lucigenin cl assay showed high oxidative stress in s. aureus due to its low superoxide dismutase (sod) activity, whereas e. coli exhibited important sod activity, responsible for little production of o2 - in absence or presence of ciprofloxacin. reduction of nitroblue of tetrazolium (nbt) was applied. this assay indicated that there was higher oxidative stress in s. aureus and e. faecalis than in e. coli. the comparison of oxidative stress generated in  bacteria and leukocytes was used to check the selective toxicity of ciprofloxacin in comparison with pyoverdin. ciprofloxacin did not generate significant stimuli  of o2 - in neutrophils, while pyoverdin duplicated the production of o2 -. cl and nbt were useful to study the leukotoxicity of ciprofloxacin. oxidative stress caused by the antibiotic and the leukotoxic pigment was similar in bacteria.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the  clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis  (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective  on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop  against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity  of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae,  was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or  cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.

AB  == the bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 institutions in japan were supplied between the period of september and december 2001. then, the susceptibilities of them to a variety of antimicrobial agents were investigated. the number of them were 496 strains. the  breakdown of these strains was gram-positive bacteria as 29.6% and gram-negative  bacteria as 70.4%. susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (vcm) showed a strong  activity, and this drug also had a strong activity against mrsa in preventing growth of all strains at 1 microgram/ml. in addition, arbekacin (abk) showed strong activity with the mic90 of 2 micrograms/ml against mrsa and prevented growth of all strains at 4 micrograms/ml. abk also showed a strong activity against staphylococcus epidermidis in preventing growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/ml. ampicillin (abpc) and cefozopran (czop) showed a relatively strong  activity against s. epidermidis (mic90: 8 micrograms/ml). abpc, imipenem (ipm), and vcm showed strong activities against enterococcus faecalis. no increase of low-susceptible strains in e. faecalis was observed against these antimicrobial agents. against escherichia coli, carbapenems showed the highest activities: meropenem (mepm) prevented growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/ml; ipm prevented growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/ml. czop and cefotiam (ctm) also showed strong activities against e. coli: mic90 of czop was within 0.125 microgram/ml; mic90 of ctm was within 0.5 microgram/ml. quinolone-resistant e. coli was detected at frequency of 9.3%, which was lower than that in the last year, and was higher level than those in up to 1999. mepm showed the strongest activity against citrobacter freundii in preventing growth of all strains at 0.125 microgram/ml. almost all drugs showed strong activities against klebsiella  pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, and mepm prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. against serratia marcescens, the mic90 of gentamicin (gm) was the lowest value being 2 micrograms/ml, and those of ipm and carumonam were 8 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost all drugs  were not so active. the mic90 of gm was 8 micrograms/ml, those of ipm and amikacin were 16 micrograms/ml, and those of all other drugs were over than 32 micrograms/ml.

TI  == [activities of antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 medical institutions during 2000 in japan].
AB  == a survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 japanese medical institutions in 2000. a total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. a high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococcus faecium. isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa from uti accounted for 30-60%.  however, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, moraxella catarrhalis,  the enterobacteriaceae family, and haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). about 85% of p. aeruginosa isolated from rti were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among mrsa, enterococci, and p. aeruginosa isolated from uti, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and p. aeruginosa from rti as has been demonstrated in previous studies.

TI  == novel semi-synthetic nocathiacin antibiotics: synthesis and antibacterial activity of bis- and mono-o-alkylated derivatives.
AB  == several semi-synthetic bis- and mono-o-alkyl nocathiacin derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity. mono-o-alkyl n-hydroxyindole analogues 3a-l were prepared by regioselective alkylation. bis-o-alkyl nocathiacins 4a-f were obtained by treatment with base and excess electrophile. a one-pot protection-alkylation-deprotection strategy was developed for the preparation of mono-o-alkyl hydroxypyridine analogues 5a,b. most of the bis- and mono-o-alkyl nocathiacins maintained good in vitro activity but showed reduced in vivo efficacy when compared with the natural product. the excellent in vivo activity and improved water solubility of phosphate analogues 3m and 4g suggest their use as potential pro-drugs.

TI  == genetic analysis of a high-level vancomycin-resistant isolate of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == vancomycin is usually reserved for treatment of serious infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant staphylococcus aureus. a clinical isolate of  s. aureus with high-level resistance to vancomycin (minimal inhibitory concentration = 1024 microg/ml) was isolated in june 2002. this isolate harbored  a 57.9-kilobase multiresistance conjugative plasmid within which tn1546 (vana) was integrated. additional elements on the plasmid encoded resistance to trimethoprim (dfra), beta-lactams (blaz), aminoglycosides (aaca-aphd), and disinfectants (qacc). genetic analyses suggest that the long-anticipated transfer of vancomycin resistance to a methicillin-resistant s. aureus occurred in vivo by interspecies transfer of tn1546 from a co-isolate of enterococcus faecalis.

TI  == antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of tick defensin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == defensins are a major group of antimicrobial peptides and are found widely in vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. invertebrate defensins have been identified from insects, scorpions, mussels and ticks. in this study, chemically  synthesized tick defensin was used to further investigate the activity spectrum and mode of action of natural tick defensin. synthetic tick defensin showed antibacterial activity against many gram-positive bacteria but not gram-negative  bacteria and low hemolytic activity, characteristic of invertebrate defensins. furthermore, bactericidal activity against pathogenic gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was observed. however, more than 30 min was necessary for tick defensin to completely kill bacteria. the interaction of tick defensin with  the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and its ability to disrupt the membrane potential was analyzed. tick defensin was able to disrupt the membrane potential  over a period of 30-60 min consistent with its relatively slow killing. transmission electron microscopy of micrococcus luteus treated with tick defensin showed lysis of the cytoplasmic membrane and leakage of cellular cytoplasmic contents. these findings suggest that the primary mechanism of action of tick defensin is bacterial cytoplasmic membrane lysis. in addition, incomplete cell division with multiple cross-wall formation was occasionally seen in tick defensin-treated bacteria showing pleiotropic secondary effects of tick defensin.

TI  == structural genomics of highly conserved microbial genes of unknown function in search of new antibacterial targets.
AB  == with more than 100 antibacterial drugs at our disposal in the 1980's, the problem of bacterial infection was considered solved. today, however, most hospital infections are insensitive to several classes of antibacterial drugs, and deadly  strains of staphylococcus aureus resistant to vancomycin--the last resort antibiotic--have recently begin to appear. other life-threatening microbes, such  as enterococcus faecalis and mycobacterium tuberculosis are already able to resist every available antibiotic. there is thus an urgent, and continuous need for new, preferably large-spectrum, antibacterial molecules, ideally targeting new biochemical pathways. here we report on the progress of our structural genomics program aiming at the discovery of new antibacterial gene targets among  evolutionary conserved genes of uncharacterized function. a series of bioinformatic and comparative genomics analyses were used to identify a set of 221 candidate genes common to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. these genes were split between two laboratories. they are now submitted to a systematic 3-d structure determination protocol including cloning, protein expression and purification, crystallization, x-ray diffraction, structure interpretation, and function prediction. we describe here our strategies for the 111 genes processed  in our laboratory. bioinformatics is used at most stages of the production process and out of 111 genes processed--and 17 months into the project--108 have  been successfully cloned, 103 have exhibited detectable expression, 84 have led to the production of soluble protein, 46 have been purified, 12 have led to usable crystals, and 7 structures have been determined.

TI  == concentrations in plasma, urinary excretion, and bactericidal activity of linezolid (600 milligrams) versus those of ciprofloxacin (500 milligrams) in healthy volunteers receiving a single oral dose.
AB  == in a randomized crossover study, 12 volunteers (6 males, 6 females) received a single oral dose of 600 mg of linezolid or 500 mg of ciprofloxacin to assess the  concentrations in plasma (up to 24 h), urinary excretion (by high-pressure liquid chromatography), and bactericidal titers in urine (ubt) at intervals up to 120 h. the mean maximum concentration of linezolid in plasma was 13.1 mg/liter, and that of ciprofloxacin was 2.46 mg/liter. the median cumulative levels of renal excretion of the administered dose of the parent drug were 44% for linezolid (range, 28 to 47%; mean +/- standard deviation, 40% +/- 7.8%) and 43% for ciprofloxacin (range, 20 to 56%; mean +/- standard deviation, 40% +/- 9.3%). the  ubts, i.e., the highest twofold dilution (with antibiotic-free urine used as the  diluent) of urine that was still bactericidal, were determined for a reference strain and five gram-positive clinical uropathogens for which the mics of linezolid and ciprofloxacin were as follows: staphylococcus aureus atcc 27278, 2  and 0.25 mg/liter, respectively; staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible), 1 and 16 mg/liter, respectively; staphylococcus aureus (methicillin resistant), 2 and 64 mg/liter, respectively; staphylococcus saprophyticus (methicillin susceptible), 1 and 0.25 mg/liter, respectively; enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 1 mg/liter, respectively; and enterococcus faecium, 2 and 1 mg/liter, respectively. the median ubts of linezolid measured within the first 6 h were 1:96 for each of  the two enterococcal strains and between 1:128 and 1:256 for the four staphylococcal strains. the median ubts of ciprofloxacin were 1:64 for the two enterococcal strains; between 1:384 and 1:512 for the two ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains; and 1 (bactericidal activity of undiluted urine only) and 1:2 for the two resistant staphylococcal strains, respectively. the areas under the ubt-time curve (aubt) for linezolid and ciprofloxacin showed  no statistically significant (p<0.05) differences except for a better aubt for linezolid for the two ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococcal strains. for linezolid there were no statistically significant differences in ubts or aubts for ciprofloxacin-susceptible and -resistant strains. thus, the bactericidal activities of linezolid and ciprofloxacin against susceptible strains in urine were comparable, whereas linezolid also exhibited the same good bactericidal activity against ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. therefore, linezolid should be  tested for use as empirical treatment for complicated urinary tract infections due to gram-positive uropathogens in an appropriate clinical trial.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == role of quinupristin/dalfopristin in the treatment of gram-positive nosocomial infections in haematological or oncological patients.
AB  == gram-positive pathogens, primarily staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci, are now the predominant causes of infection in neutropenic haematology/oncology patients, but are often resistant to multiple antibiotics. glycopeptides have been the only alternative antibiotic treatments for multidrug-resistant gram-positive infections to date. however, glycopeptides are not always effective or well tolerated, and can produce nephrotoxic or ototoxic effects. quinupristin/dalfopristin is a recently introduced streptogramin antibiotic that  is active in vitro against most of the major gram-positive pathogens causing infection in neutropenic patients. recent studies of the in vitro susceptibility  of clinical isolates of gram-positive pathogens to quinupristin/dalfopristin are  summarized. pre-clinical and clinical studies of the efficacy and safety of quinupristin/dalfopristin in the treatment of gram-positive infections are reviewed. quinupristin/dalfopristin is active in vitro against the vast majority  of recent isolates of relevant gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, but excluding enterococcus faecalis. pre-clinical and clinical data indicate the efficacy of quinupristin/dalfopristin in infections caused by these organisms, including bacteraemia and catheter-related infections. quinupristin/dalfopristin is not associated with nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity. quinupristin/dalfopristin is a potential alternative to glycopeptides in haematology or oncology patients with multidrug-resistant gram-positive infections, especially those who are unresponsive to, or intolerant of, glycopeptides.

AB  == a series of soft quaternary ammonium antimicrobial agents, which are analogues to currently used quaternary ammonium preservatives such as cetyl pyridinium chloride and benzalkonium chloride, were synthesized. these soft analogues consist of long alkyl chain connected to a polar headgroup via chemically labile  spacer group. they are characterized by facile nonenzymatic and enzymatic degradation to form their original nontoxic building blocks. however, their chemical stability has to be adequate in order for them to have antimicrobial effects. stability studies and antibacterial and antiviral activity measurements  revealed relationship between activity, lipophilicity, and stability. their minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) was as low as 1 microg/ml, and their viral reduction was in some cases greater than 6.7 log. the structure-activity studies  demonstrate that the bioactive compounds (i.e., mic for gram-positive bacteria of <10 microg/ml) have an alkyl chain length between 12 and 18 carbon atoms, with a  polar headgroup preferably of a small quaternary ammonium group, and their acquired inactivation half-life must be greater than 3 h at 60 degrees c.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of 'mgp' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  == aim: to determine whether 'mgp' gutta-percha (westport, ct, usa), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. methodology: inocula of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sanguis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'mgp' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'mgp' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. results: povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited s. sanguis and a. odontolyticus. 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited s. aureus, s. sanguis, a. odontolyticus and f. nucleatum. neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited growth of e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa. conclusions: compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'mgp' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on s. aureus and f. nucleatum, but not on e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

TI  == dna binding ligands targeting drug-resistant bacteria: structure, activity, and pharmacology.
AB  == we describe the lead optimization and structure-activity relationship of dna minor-groove binding ligands, a novel class of antibacterial molecules. these compounds have been shown to target a/t-rich sites within the bacterial genome and, as a result, inhibit dna replication and rna transcription. the optimization was focused on n-terminal aromatic heterocycles and c-terminal amines and resulted in compounds with improved in vivo tolerability and excellent in vitro antibacterial potency (mic >/= 0.031 microg/ml) against a broad range of gram-positive pathogens, including drug-resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant stapylococcus aureus (mrsa), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp), and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre). in a first proof-of-concept study, a selected compound (35) showed in vivo efficacy in a mouse peritonitis model against methicillin-sensitive s. aureus infection with an ed(50) value of 30 mg/kg.

TI  == pharmacodynamic profile of daptomycin against enterococcus species and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus in a murine thigh infection model.
AB  == objective: to describe the pharmacodynamic profile of daptomycin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and enterococci species based  on bacterial density in an immunocompromised mouse thigh infection model. materials and methods: the pharmacodynamic (pd) profile of daptomycin was determined against two mrsa, one vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, and one vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis using the immunocompromised murine thigh model. efficacy was assessed by the change in log10 cfu in thighs after 24 h of drug treatment. results: daptomycin produced a maximal kill of 4.5-5 log10 cfu against the mrsa and 1.5-2 log10 for the enterococcus species. auc/mic was the most predictive of the pd parameters. utilizing mics determined in serum or broth in the calculation of the pd parameters had minimal effect on this correlation. aucfree/micbroth required for static effects with mrsa and enterococcus species were 12-36 and 5-13, whereas 99% of maximal kill was achieved at ratios of 171-442 and 38-157, respectively. conclusions: these data reveal the potent in vivo bactericidal activity of daptomycin against mrsa and enterococcus species using clinically achievable drug exposures (dose 4-6 mg/kg per day) currently under investigation in man.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in burkina faso.
AB  == burkina faso is one of the subsaharan african nations. no national services for monitoring of antibiotic resistance are available, so the number of reports of resistance patterns among hospital pathogens are inconsistent. in order to evaluate antibiotic resistance, a total of 1998 valuable microrganisms were analysed during 2000 at the medical centre st. camille of ouagadougou, burkina faso's capital. they were isolated as follows: 1012 from urine-culture, 503 from  tonsil swabs, 398 from pus, 53 from sputum and 32 from blood-cultures. escherichia coli was the most isolated microrganism from urine (44%); enterococcus faecalis from tonsil swabs (96.4%), staphylococcus aureus from pus (17%) and k. pneumoniae (70%) from sputum. in general, resistance to the old antibiotics, such as aminopenicillins and cotrimoxazole was shown. the most active antibiotic was norfloxacin, a rarely used antibiotic in this country. in conclusion, our study shows that it is necessary to create antibiotic-resistance  surveillance centers in the developing countries to adopt an accurate therapy to  avoid exporting of antibiotic resistance to the developed countries linked to increased emigration.

TI  == in vitro conjugal transfer of tetracycline resistance from lactobacillus isolates to other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the ability of 14 lactobacillus strains, isolated from fermented dry sausages, to transfer tetracycline resistance encoded by tet(m) through conjugation was examined using filter mating experiments. seven out of 14 tetracycline-resistant  lactobacillus isolates were able to transfer in vitro this resistance to enterococcus faecalis at frequencies ranging from 10(-4) to 10(-6) transconjugants per recipient. two of these strains could also transfer their resistance to lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, whereas no conjugal transfer to a staphylococcus aureus recipient was found. these data suggest that meat lactobacilli might be reservoir organisms for acquired resistance genes that can  be spread to other lactic acid bacteria. in order to assess the risk of this potential hazard, the magnitude of transfer along the food chain merits further research.

TI  == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

TI  == evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of urinary catheters impregnated with antiseptics in an in vitro urinary tract model.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the long-term efficacy of urinary foley catheters (latex  and silicone) impregnated with (1) chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine (cxs) and (2) chlorhexidine, silver sulfadiazine, and triclosan (cxst) in inhibiting extra-luminal bacterial adherence and to compare their efficacy with that of silver hydrogel latex (sh) and nitrofurazone-treated silicone (nf) catheters. design: the antimicrobial spectrum of these catheters was evaluated using a zone  of inhibition assay. a novel in vitro urinary tract model was developed to study  the potential in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters in preventing extraluminal bacterial colonization. the "meatus" was inoculated daily with staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aerginosa, and candida albicans. the "bladder" portion of the model was cultured daily to determine bacterial growth. results: both cxs and cxst catheters had a broader antimicrobial spectrum than sh and nf catheters. in  the in vitro model, cxst latex and silicone catheters exhibited significantly better efficacy (3 to 25days) against uropathogens, compared with cxs (1 to 14 days) and control (0 to 5 days) catheters (p = .01). cxst latex catheters exhibited significantly longer protection against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared with sh catheters (p = .01). cxst silicone catheters resisted colonization with staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis for a significantly longer period (23 to 24 days) than did nf catheters (9 to 11 days)  (p = .01). conclusion: catheters impregnated with synergistic combinations of chlorhexidine, silver sulfadiazine, and triclosan exhibited broad-spectrum, long-term resistance against microbial colonization on their outer surfaces.

TI  == lavage of contaminated surfaces: an in vitro evaluation of the effectiveness of different systems.
AB  == introduction: lavage is an effective, additive therapeutic procedure with a broad application in surgery. in addition to irrigation with the conventional syringe,  the pulsed jet lavage system is used. the effectiveness of bacterial reduction depends on, among other things, the irrigation pressure. complications of high-irrigation pressure in bone and joint surgery are intramedullary seeding of  bacteria, visible damage of the bone, or delayed healing of the fracture by lavage of the fracture zone. the purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mechanical irrigation on several surfaces using different systems of irrigation. materials and methods: four different test surfaces (nonbiological surfaces: sterilized bone cement and titanium osteosynthesis plates; biological surfaces: gamma-irradiated bovine muscle and cancellous bone)  were contaminated with a defined suspension of different bacterial species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa). the samples were irrigated with three different systems (conventional 50-ml plastic syringe, manual pump irrigator, jet lavage) in a standardized, randomized experimental setup. after irrigation of the sample the amount of residual bacteria (colony-forming units) was determined. results: an effective bacterial reduction was achieved with the use of irrigation regardless of the system that was used and surface that was cleaned. on average p. aeruginosa was reduced around log 1.907, e. faecalis around log 1.666 and s. aureus around log 1.506. on biological surfaces, a reduction around log 0.801 for muscle and around log 1.738 for bone samples was achieved independent of the system that was used for irrigation. for the titanium surface a reduction of log 1.652 compared with log 2.580 for the bone cement surface was demonstrated. statistical analysis showed that mechanical lavage resulted in a significant reduction of all tested bacterial species on the surfaces. the best bacterial reduction was achieved with the manual pump irrigator (p = 0.06). the results demonstrate that the manual pump irrigator achieved significantly better bacterial reduction (p = 0.039) on "biological surfaces" (bone and muscle) compared with nonbiological surfaces (titanium and cement). conclusion: the results show that irrigation is an effective technique for bacterial reduction on contaminated surfaces. a remarkable finding was the limited bacterial reduction of staphylococcus aureus from gamma-sterilized muscle. the use of a continuous manual pump irrigator showed a greater reduction of bacteria contamination compared with the other means of irrigation investigated. in conclusion, the manual continuous irrigation system proved to be practical, economical and effective in reducing the bacterial load on various surfaces.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and interference of tobramycin and chloramphenicol on bacterial adhesion to intraocular lenses.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of tobramycin and chloramphenicol were evaluated by  determining minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, group a, group b and group g streptococci, klebsiella spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia and ciprofloxacin-resistant and -susceptible pseudomonas aeruginosa,  as well as by evaluating interference on adhesion of slime producer strains of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa to intraocular lens from tobramycin and chloramphenicol  pharmaceutical products by scanning electron microscopy. chloramphenicol was more active against gram-positive bacteria than was tobramycin, which instead showed higher activity against ciprofloxacin-susceptible p. aeruginosa. treatment of lenses with the antimicrobial products eradicated the bacterial biofilm, which was already notably reduced after 5 min. this activity was more pronounced for chloramphenicol against s. aureus and for tobramycin against p. aeruginosa. bacterial adhesion was also significantly reduced when lenses colonized by p. aeruginosa were treated with chloramphenicol, even if they were resistant to this drug. in conclusion, the tested drugs showed marked antibacterial activity, particularly by interfering with bacterial biofilms. the data obtained in this study suggest a specific use of chloramphenicol in topical prophylaxis aimed at avoiding bacterial contaminations. however, further specific in vivo studies are  needed to confirm these data.

AB  == background: cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (mln) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. materials and methods: mln was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. the characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for mln after hepatectomy were compared. postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. results: no bacteria were cultured in mln before hepatectomy. bacterial translocation (bt) to mln after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (bt group). after multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. bt group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in bt group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from mlns. conclusions: bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.

TI  == optimization of computer software settings improves accuracy of pulsed-field gel  electrophoresis macrorestriction fragment pattern analysis.
AB  == computer-assisted analysis of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) libraries can facilitate comparisons of fragment patterns present on multiple gels. we evaluated the ability of the advanced analysis (version 4.01) and database (version 1.12) modules of the phoretix gel analysis software package (nonlinear usa, inc., durham, n.c.) to accurately match dna fragment patterns. two gels containing 38 lanes of smai-digested enterococcus faecalis og1rf dna were analyzed to assess the impact of (i) varying the lane position of the standards,  (ii) using gel plugs made at different times, and (iii) normalizing the fragment  patterns by using molecular weight (mw) algorithms versus retardation factor (r(f)) algorithms. two sets of pfge libraries (one containing smai restriction patterns from 62 enterococcus faecium isolates and the other containing smai restriction patterns of 89 staphylococcus aureus isolates) were analyzed to assess the impact of varying the matching tolerance algorithm (designated as the  vector box setting [vbs]) in the phoretix software. varying the lane position of  standards on a gel and using gel plugs made on different days resulted in different vbss, although it was not possible to judge whether those differences were statistically significant. normalization of e. faecalis og1rf fragment patterns by r(f) and mw methodology yielded no statistically significant differences in variability between the same fragment on different lanes. suboptimal vbss decreased the specificity with which related isolates were grouped together in dendrograms. the optimal vbs for analysis of pfge fragment patterns from e. faecalis isolates differed from that for s. aureus isolates and  sometimes was not that recommended by the manufacturer. thus, computer-assisted analysis of pfge patterns seemed to compensate for the intra- and intergel variation evaluated in the present study, and optimizing the software for the species to be tested was a critical preliminary step before further pfge library  analysis.

TI  == in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria from hospitalised patients in the british isles.
AB  == piperacillin/tazobactam is used for empirical therapy of severe and complex infections. we assessed its activity, 9 years after launch, against consecutive,  clinically significant isolates from in-patients in uk and ireland. standardised  disc susceptibility tests were performed on 5031 isolates at 28 hospitals. for quality assurance purposes, 5% of these isolates were collected centrally for mic tests, as were those with exceptional resistances. compared with a similar pre-launch survey in 1991, there were major increases in the proportions of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, beta-haemolytic streptococci and enterococcus faecium isolates collected, balanced by decreases in escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis and coagulase-negative staphylococci. these changes in species prevalence mostly favoured organisms with inherent resistance(s) or-in the case of s. aureus-reflected the massive increase of mrsa, up from 0.7% of all isolates in 1991 to 14.8% in 2001. based on the disc tests, piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity against 87% of enterobacteriaceae isolates, 95% of p. aeruginosa, 99% of streptococci and 96% of enterococcus faecalis. resistance nevertheless had increased since 1991 in e. coli from 4 to 10%, klebsiella spp. (5 to 21%) and in ampc-inducible enterobacteriaceae (17 to 23%), though not in p. mirabilis or p. aeruginosa. mic tests confirmed most of the piperacillin/tazobactam resistance found by disc tests in enterobacter spp.,  but indicated susceptibility for about half of the e. coli isolates recorded as resistant in disc tests. this situation might be remedied by reducing the zone breakpoint, but this would increase the "false susceptible" rate unacceptably. thus, if disc tests suggest that an isolate is marginally resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam and the drug is sought as therapy, it is recommended that mic be determined with, e.g., an etest.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in animals.
AB  == there is currently no systematic surveillance or monitoring of antibiotic resistance in australian animals. registration of antibiotics for use in animals  is tightly controlled and has been very conservative. fluoroquinolones have not been registered for use in food producing animals and other products have been removed from the market because of human health concerns. in the late 1970s, the  animal health committee coordinated a survey of resistance in salmonella and escherichia coli isolates from cattle, pigs and poultry and in bovine staphylococcus aureus. some additional information is available from published case reports. in samples collected prior to the withdrawal of avoparcin from the  market, no vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis were detected in samples collected from pigs, whereas some vana enterococci, including e. faecium and e. faecalis, were found in chickens. no vanb enterococci were detected in either species. virginiamycin resistance was common in both pig  and poultry isolates. multiple resistance was common in e. coli and salmonellae isolates. no fluoroquinolone resistance was found in salmonellae, e. coli or campylobacter. beta-lactamase production is common in isolates from bovine mastitis, but no methicillin resistance has been detected. however, methicillin resistance has been reported in canine isolates of staphylococcus intermedius and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing e. coli has been found in dogs.

TI  == multiplex pcr for simultaneous detection of enterococcal genes vana and vanb and  staphylococcal genes meca, iles-2 and femb.
AB  == the experimental transfer of the vana gene cluster from enterococcus faecalis to  staphylococcus aureus has raised fears about the occurrence of such genetic transfer in clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. recently, infections by a s. aureus strain carrying the enterococcal vancomycin resistance  vana gene cluster were reported. the possible emergence and dissemination of these strains is a serious health threat and makes optimization of prevention strategies and fast detection methods absolutely necessary. in the present study, we developed a pcr protocol for simultaneous detection of enterococcal vana and vanb genes, the staphylococcal methicillin and mupirocin resistance markers meca  and iles-2, and identification of s. aureus. as no vancomycin-resistant s. aureus isolates were available for our study, we used mixtures of enterococcal and staphylococcal colonies that harbored the different resistance markers to show that these genes could be detected simultaneously. this protocol could be used to facilitate the detection and identification of predictable s. aureus or methicillin-resistant strains carrying vana or vanb.

AB  == garden cress, sesame, radish, and mustard seeds immersed in water were treated with high pressure (250, 300, 350, and 400 mpa) for 15 min at 20 degrees c. after treatment, percentages of seeds germinating on water agar were recorded for up to 11 days. of the seeds tested, radish seeds were found to be the most pressure sensitive, with seeds treated at 250 mpa reaching 100% germination 9 days later than untreated control seeds did. garden cress seeds, on the other hand, were the most pressure resistant, with seeds treated at 250 mpa reaching 100% germination  1 day later than untreated control seeds did. garden cress sprouts from seeds treated at 250 and 300 mpa also took about 1 day longer to reach average sprout length than sprouts from untreated control seeds did, indicating that sprout growth was not retarded once germination had occurred. garden cress seeds were inoculated with suspensions of seven different bacteria (10(7) cfu/ml) and processed with high pressure. treatment at 300 mpa (15 min, 20 degrees c) resulted in 6-log reductions of salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli mg1655,  and listeria innocua, > 4-log reductions of shigella flexneri and pressure-resistant e. coli lmm1010, and a 2-log reduction of staphylococcus aureus. enterococcus faecalis was virtually not inactivated. for suspensions of the gram-positive bacteria, similar levels of inactivation in water in the absence of garden cress seeds were found, but the inactivation of e. coil lmm1010 and s. flexneri in water in the absence of garden cress seeds was significantly less extensive. these data suggest that garden cress seeds contain a component that acts synergistically with high hydrostatic pressure against gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == the world health organization's external quality assurance system proficiency testing program has improved the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing and reporting among participating laboratories using nccls methods.
AB  == a total of 150 laboratories in 33 countries that followed the nccls testing procedures participated in the world health organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eqas-ast) from january 1998 through march 2001. laboratories tested seven bacterial isolates for antimicrobial resistance and reported the results to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) in atlanta, ga. the results were compared to the results generated at the cdc with the nccls broth microdilution and disk diffusion reference methods. although there were few testing errors with salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, drugs that are not appropriate for therapy of salmonella infections were tested and reported by 136  (91%) of 150 laboratories. in addition, 29 (20%) of 150 laboratories used the staphylococcus aureus breakpoints to report oxacillin results for staphylococcus  saprophyticus. for a vanb-containing enterococcus faecalis strain, 124 (83%) of 150 laboratories correctly reported vancomycin results that were +/-1 doubling dilution from the reference mic or +/-3 mm from the reference disk diffusion result. of the laboratories that tested streptococcus agalactiae by disk diffusion, 17% reported nonsusceptible results for penicillin in error. while 110 laboratories (73%) tested the s. pneumoniae challenge isolate against a fluoroquinolone, 83% tested it against ciprofloxacin, for which there are no nccls interpretive criteria. ten of 12 laboratories testing levofloxacin and 4 of 4 laboratories testing ofloxacin by an mic method correctly reported resistant results for the isolate. feedback letters sent to participating laboratories highlighted areas of susceptibility testing in individual laboratories that needed improvement. the positive impact of the feedback letters and the overall effectiveness of the eqas program were documented in repeat testing challenges with pneumococci and staphylococci. the 31 and 19% increases in the numbers of laboratories using appropriate testing methods for pneumococci and staphylococci, respectively, in 2000 versus 1998 indicate that laboratory performance is improving.

TI  == development of a thermally regulated broad-spectrum promoter system for use in pathogenic gram-positive species.
AB  == selectively regulating gene expression is an essential molecular tool that is lacking for many pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. in this report, we describe the evaluation of a series of promoters regulated by the bacteriophage p1 temperature-sensitive c1 repressor in enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. using the lacz gene to monitor gene expression, we examined the strength, basal expression, and induced expression of synthetic promoters carrying c1 operator sites. the promoters exhibited extremely low basal expression and, under inducing conditions, gave high levels of expression (100- to 1,000-fold induction). we demonstrate that the promoter system could be modulated by temperature and showed rapid induction and that the  mechanism of regulation occurred at the level of transcription. controlled expression with the same constructs was also demonstrated in the gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli. however, low basal expression and the ability to achieve derepression were dependent on both the number of mismatches in the c1 operator sites and the promoter driving c1 expression. since the promoters were designed to contain conserved promoter elements from gram-positive species and were constructed in a broad-host-range plasmid, this system will provide a new opportunity for controlled gene expression in a variety of gram-positive bacteria.

AB  == the design, synthesis, and in vitro microbiological analysis of an array of forty covalently linked vancomycin dimers are reported. this work was undertaken to systematically probe the impact of linkage orientation and linker length on biological activity against susceptible and drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. to prepare the array, monomeric vancomycin synthons were linked through four distinct positions of the glycopeptide (c-terminus (c), n-terminus (n), vancosamine residue (v), and resorcinol ring (r)) in 10 unique pairwise combinations. amphiphilic, peptide-based linkers of four different lengths (11, 19, 27, and 43 total atoms) were employed. both linkage orientation and linker length were found to affect in vitro antibacterial potency. the v-v series displayed the greatest potency against vancomycin-susceptible organisms and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre) of vanb phenotype, while the c-c, c-v, and v-r series displayed the most promising broad-spectrum activity that included vre of vana phenotype. dimers bearing the shortest linkers were in  all cases preferred for activity against vre. the effects of linkage orientation  and linker length on in vitro potency were not uniform; for example, (1) no single compound displayed activity that was superior against all test organisms to that of vancomycin or the other dimers, (2) linker length effects varied with  test organism, and (3) whereas one-half of the dimers were more potent than vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), only one dimer was more potent against methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and glycopeptide-intermediate susceptible s. aureus (gisa). in interpreting the results, we have considered the potential roles of multivalency and of other phenomena.

AB  == bacterial enoyl-acp reductase (fabi) is responsible for catalyzing the final step of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of novel antibacterial agents. previously we reported the development of fabi inhibitor 4 with narrow spectrum antimicrobial activity and in vivo efficacy against staphylococcus aureus via intraperitoneal (ip) administration. through iterative medicinal chemistry aided by x-ray crystal structure analysis,  a new series of inhibitors has been developed with greatly increased potency against fabi-containing organisms. several of these new inhibitors have potent antibacterial activity against multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus, and compound 30 demonstrates exceptional oral (po) in vivo efficacy in a s. aureus infection model in rats. while optimizing fabi inhibitory activity, compounds 29  and 30 were identified as having low micromolar fabk inhibitory activity, thereby increasing the antimicrobial spectrum of these compounds to include the fabk-containing pathogens streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. the results described herein support the hypothesis that bacterial enoyl-acp reductases are valid targets for antibacterial agents.

AB  == objective: although alcohol-based hand rinses and gels have recommended application times of 30 to 60 seconds, healthcare workers usually take much less  time for hand hygiene. we compared the efficacies of four alcohol-based hand rubs produced in europe (hand rinses a, b, and c and one gel formulation) with the efficacy of the european norm 1500 (en 1500) reference waterless hand antisepsis  agent (60% 2-propanol) at short application times. design: comparative crossover  study. setting: infection control program laboratory of a large tertiary-care teaching hospital. participants: twelve healthy volunteers. intervention: measurement of residual bacterial counts and log reduction factors following inoculation of fingertips with staphylococcus aurens american type culture collection (atcc) 6538, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442, and a clinical isolate of enterococcus faecalis. results: all hand rinses satisfied en 1500 standards following a single application for 15 and 30 seconds, but reduction factors for the gel formulation were significantly lower for all tested organisms (all p < .025). conclusions: under stringent conditions similar to clinical practice, all  three hand rinses proved to be more efficacious than the marketed alcohol-based gel in reducing bacterial counts on hands. further studies are necessary to determine the in vivo efficacy of alcohol-based gels and whether they are as efficacious as alcohol-based rinses in reducing the transmission of nosocomial infections.

TI  == the significance of sunlight for the elimination of indicator bacteria in small-scale bathing ponds in central europe.
AB  == in order to determine the impact of sunlight on the reduction rate of indicator bacteria, bathing waters of different turbidity were artificially contaminated with indicator bacteria and exposed to sunlight. the reduction rates determined for the indicator bacteria showed a significant correlation with radiation intensity and, thus, also the time of day as well as the turbidity of the water.  under conditions of strong radiation intensity and low water turbidity (< 5 ftu), indicator bacteria were eliminated within 1-2 h of contamination with an initial  concentration of 10(5) cfu/ml. moreover, differences between different indicator  bacteria were found. enterococcus faecalis proved to be significantly more resistant to sunlight than the other indicator bacteria tested (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus). the results of the present study, namely the complete elimination of indicator bacteria within a few hours, showed  that sunlight, given an appropriate intensity and good water transparency, was the most important factor in the reduction of hygienically-relevant microorganisms in surface waters and, thus, also in small-scale bathing ponds.

TI  == clinical isolates of enterococcus faecium exhibit strain-specific collagen binding mediated by acm, a new member of the mscramm family.
AB  == a collagen-binding adhesin of enterococcus faecium, acm, was identified. acm shows 62% similarity to the staphylococcus aureus collagen adhesin cna over the entire protein and is more similar to cna (60% and 75% similarity with cna a and  b domains respectively) than to the enterococcus faecalis collagen-binding adhesin, ace, which shares homology with acm only in the a domain. despite the detection of acm in 32 out of 32 e. faecium isolates, only 11 of these (all clinical isolates, including four vancomycin-resistant endocarditis isolates and  seven other isolates) exhibited binding to collagen type i (ci). although acm from three ci-binding vancomycin-resistant e. faecium clinical isolates showed 100% identity, analysis of acm genes and their promoter regions from six non-ci-binding strains identified deletions or mutations that introduced stop codons and/or is elements within the gene or the promoter region in five out of six strains, suggesting that the presence of an intact functional acm gene is necessary for binding of e. faecium strains to ci. recombinant acm a domain showed specific and concentration-dependent binding to collagen, and this protein competed with e. faecium binding to immobilized ci. consistent with the adherence phenotype and sequence data, probing with acm-specific iggs purified from anti-recombinant acm a polyclonal rabbit serum confirmed the surface expression of acm in three out of three collagen-binding clinical isolates of e. faecium tested, but in none of the strains with a non-functional pseudo acm gene. introduction of a functional acm gene into two non-ci-binding natural acm mutant  strains conferred a ci-binding phenotype, further confirming that native acm is sufficient for the binding of e. faecium to ci. these results demonstrate that acm, which encodes a potential virulence factor, is functional only in certain infection-derived clinical isolates of e. faecium, and suggest that acm is the primary adhesin responsible for the ability of e. faecium to bind collagen.

TI  == the genes coding for enterocin ej97 production by enterococcus faecalis ej97 are  located on a conjugative plasmid.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis ej97 produces a cationic bacteriocin (enterocin ej97) of low molecular mass (5,327.7 da). the complete amino acid sequence of enterocin ej97 was elucidated after automated microsequencing of oligopeptides generated by endoproteinase gluc digestion and cyanogen bromide treatment. transfer of the 60-kb conjugative plasmid pej97 from the bacteriocinogenic strain e. faecalis ej97 to e. faecalis og1x conferred bacteriocin production and resistance on the recipient. the genetic determinants of enterocin ej97 were located in an 11.3-kb  ecori-bglii dna fragment of pej97. this region was cloned and sequenced. it contains the ej97a structural gene plus three open reading frames (orfs) (ej97b,  ej97c, and ej97d) and three putative orfs transcribed in the opposite direction (orfa, orfb, and orfc). the gene ej97a translated as a 44-amino-acid residue mature protein lacking a leader peptide with no homology to other bacteriocins described so far. the product of ej97b (ej97b) shows strong homology in its c-terminal domain to the superfamily of bacterial atp-binding cassette transporters. the products of ej97c (ej97c) and ej97d (ej97d) could be proteins with 71 and 64 residues, respectively, of unknown functions and with no significant similarity to known proteins. there are two additional orfs (orf1 and orf6) flanking the ej97 module, which have been identified as a transposon-like structure (tnp). orf1 shows similarities to transposase of the lactococcus lactis element iss1 and is up to 50% identical to is1216. this is flanked by two 18-bp inverted repeats (irs) that are almost identical to those of iss1 and is1216. orf6 (resej97) shows strong homology to the resolvase of plasmid pam373 and up to 40 to 50% homology with the recombinase of several multiresistant plasmids and transposons from staphylococcus aureus and e. faecalis. these data suggest that ej97 could represent a new class of bacteriocins with a novel secretion mechanism and that the whole structure could be a composite transposon. furthermore, two additional gene clusters were found: one cluster is probably related to the region responsible for the replication of plasmid pej97, and the second cluster is related to the sex pheromone response. these regions showed a high homology to the corresponding regions of the conjugative plasmids pam373, ppd1, and pad1 of e. faecalis, suggesting that they have a common origin.

AB  == emergence of bacterial resistance has rendered ineffective a number of previously valuable antibiotic treatments and now threatens the effectiveness of others. beta-lactam resistance is no longer predominantly a hospital-treated problem; it  has now become an important issue in community medicine. more than 100-beta-lactamases have been identified and classified according to their structure, substrate specificity, and whether they are chromosomal or plasmid-mediated. beta-lactamase production is rare among gram-positive pathogens, important exceptions being staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. by contrast, many gram-negative pathogens are beta-lactamase-positive;  inducible and/or hyper-productive strains are particularly challenging in the clinical setting. surveillance programs have shown that, in general, beta-lactam  resistance is on the increase, and that the plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase have  developed rapidly over past decade such as esbls and carbapenemases.

TI  == overview of resistant gram-positive pathogens in the surgical patient.
AB  == staphylococci and enterococci are the most common pathogens in surgical-site and  bloodstream infections. the emergence of drug resistance among these gram-positive bacteria thus poses a substantial threat to patients with surgical  infections. resistance to methicillin/oxacillin is frequently observed in staphylococcus aureus isolates and is often accompanied by multidrug resistance.  vancomycin is usually the treatment of choice for infections caused by methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), so the recent appearance of s. aureus isolated with intermediate sensitivity to vancomycin is cause for concern. vancomycin resistance has already appeared in most species of enterococci. infections caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) are associated with increased mortality compared to infections caused by vancomycin-sensitive isolates. measures for preventing vancomycin resistance include reducing the use  of vancomycin and other agents that appear to be associated with vre, including third-generation cephalosporins and anti-anaerobic drugs. third-generation cephalosporins have also been implicated in the increased prevalence of mrsa infections. prudent use of existing antibiotics is an essential strategy for combating the rising tide of drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens.

AB  == multiresistance to antimicrobial agents is common in staphylococci and pneumococci isolates in the western pacific region. the activity of linezolid, a  new oxazolidinone, was evaluated against a spectrum of gram-positive species collected in the region. eighteen laboratories from six countries in the western  pacific examined the linezolid susceptibility of 2143 clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) and enterococcus spp. using broth microdilution or disc diffusion methodology. for streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 351) and other streptococci (n = 83), etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) strips were used. results were compared with other common and important antimicrobials. linezolid-resistant strains were not detected among streptococci  or staphylococci, including a significant proportion of s. aureus strains that were multiresistant. almost all enterococci, including 14 vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, were linezolid susceptible. a small proportion of enterococci (0.8%) were intermediate to linezolid, and one strain of enterococcus faecalis had a zone diameter of 20 mm (resistant). the linezolid mic ranges (mic(90)) of those strains tested by broth microdilution or etest were: 1-4 mg/l  (2 mg/l) for s. aureus, 0.5-4 mg/l (2 mg/l) for cons, 0.5-4 mg/l (2 mg/l) for enterococcus spp., 0.12-2 mg/l (1 mg/l) for s. pneumoniae and 0.25-2 mg/l (1 mg/l) for streptococcus spp. there was no difference in linezolid susceptibility  between countries or between multiresistant and susceptible strains of each species monitored.

TI  == mc21-a, a bactericidal antibiotic produced by a new marine bacterium, pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. o-bc30(t), against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == we previously reported a new marine bacterium, pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. o-bc30(t), which produced a bactericidal antibiotic against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). in the present study, we purified an anti-mrsa substance (mc21-a) from the methanol extract of the cells of p. phenolica o-bc30(t) and analyzed its chemical structure. mc21-a was determined to be 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-2,2'-biphenyldiol by spectrometric analyses. its anti-mrsa activity against 10 clinical isolates of mrsa was comparable to that of vancomycin (mc21-a mics, 1 to 2 micro g/ml; vancomycin mics, <0.25 to 2 micro g/ml). this substance was also high active against enterococcus serolicida, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus faecalis but was  less active against streptococcus spp. a time-kill study also demonstrated that mc21-a was bactericidal and that its killing rate was much higher than that of vancomycin. the postantibiotic effect (pae) of mc21-a against a clinical mrsa isolate, strain e 31243, was also comparable to that of vancomycin (mc21-a paes,  1.46 to 1.65 h; vancomycin paes, 0.84 to 1.43 h). however, a lysis experiment demonstrated that this substance failed to lyse mrsa cells. this substance also did not lyse human erythrocytes. a sytox green staining experiment implied that this substance permeabilized the cell membrane of mrsa as its mode of action. when its activities against a hypersensitive escherichia coli mutant (ko 1489) and wild-type strains were tested, mc21-a exhibited higher levels of activity against the former. furthermore, mc21-a was not cytotoxic to human normal fibroblast, rat pheochromocytoma, and vero cells at concentrations up to 50 micro g/ml. these results suggest that mc21-a might be useful as a lead compound in the development of new types of anti-mrsa substances with modes of action different from those of vancomycin and teicoplanin.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities on antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). iii. secular changes in susceptibility].
AB  == the bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (utis) in 10 institutions in japan were supplied  between august 2000 and july 2001. then, the susceptibilities of these bacteria to various antimicrobial agents were examined, and the results were compared with those obtained between 1992 and 1999. comparison was made by classifying strains  isolated from patients into those in uncomplicated utis and those in complicated  utis (including with or without indwelling catheter). e. faecalis showed good susceptibility to ampicillin (abpc) and imipenem (ipm), and the mic90s were 2 micrograms/ml. also, e. faecalis showed good susceptibility to vancomycin (vcm).  however, the mic90, which was 2 micrograms/ml between 1992 and 1999, rose to 4 micrograms/ml in patients with complicated utis because the strains inhibited at  4 micrograms/ml increased more than before. the low susceptibility of s. aureus to arbekacin (abk) in complicated utis, as shown in 1998 and 1999, recovered in 2000, and no strains inhibited at > or = 4 micrograms/ml were detected. e. coli showed good susceptibility to ctm (mic90: 0.25-0.5 microgram/ml) and czop (mic90: < or = 0.125 microgram/ml) and was not resistant to those. e. coli also showed good susceptibility to the other drugs except to penicillins. decreases in susceptibility of e. coli to quinolones, ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and sparfloxacin (spfx) were observed in the patients with complicated utis. the susceptibility of klebsiella spp. to all drugs did not significantly change in 2000 and was generally good except to penicillins. although the susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to carbapenems was notable, the mic90 went up from 4 micrograms/ml to  16 micrograms/ml in complicated utis compared with those observed in the previous year.

TI  == evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  == the newly developed rapid lumi eiken/is60 (rl/is60) system automatically determines mics by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. the present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility  testing. chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with mics determined by the reference microdilution method. when the mics of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (qc) strains (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the rl/is60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the qc limits  proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards. the system  was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including e. coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, p. aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae. overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the rl/is60 system and the reference microdilution method. our  results suggest that the rl/is60 system provides rapid and reliable mics of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as qc strains.

AB  == a 54-yr-old man with c6 quadriplegia and a neurogenic bowel and bladder was evaluated for clearance of a urinary tract infection after treatment for organisms susceptible to the antibiotics used, and an organism resistant to all antibiotics on the panel grew on the initial follow-up urine culture. multidrug-resistant organisms present increasing challenges and risks in the management of the neurogenic bladder in patients with spinal cord injury. in an effort to control and reduce the impact and risk associated with these organisms, management methods of the neurogenic bladder and infection control policies should be adjusted according to guidelines from the centers for disease control and related research; such policies could include surveillance for multidrug-resistant organisms and isolation of patients who test positive for these organisms.

AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with activity against resistant gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the in vivo efficacy of rwj-54428 was evaluated against gram-positive bacteria in four mouse models of infection. rwj-54428 was effective in vivo against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. aureus in a mouse model of sepsis, with 50% effective doses being similar to those of vancomycin. in a single-dose neutropenic mouse thigh model of infection, rwj-54428 at 30 mg/kg of  body weight showed activity similar to that of vancomycin at 30 mg/kg against a strain of methicillin-resistant s. aureus. rwj-54428 also showed a prolonged in vivo postantibiotic effect in this model. in a mouse model of pneumonia due to a  penicillin-susceptible strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, rwj-54428 displayed efficacy and potency superior to those of penicillin g and cefotaxime. in a mouse model of pyelonephritis due to enterococcus faecalis, rwj-54428 had bactericidal  effects similar to those of vancomycin and ampicillin, but at two- to threefold lower total daily doses. these studies show that rwj-54428 is active in experimental mouse models of infection against gram-positive organisms, including strains resistant to earlier cephalosporins and penicillin g.

AB  == the objective of this study was to understand more of the innate immune response  to helicobacter pylori by determining the expression of human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2) in various gastric mucosal tissues and mkn45 gastric cancer cells with or without h. pylori. semi-quantitative taqman rt-pcr and immunohistochemistry were  carried out. the antimicrobial effects of a transfected hbd-2 gene against h. pylori were also evaluated. the results showed that hbd-2 was expressed in inflamed gastric mucosal tissues with h. pylori infection, but not in the absence of h. pylori infection. expression was also detected in gastric cancers in patients with h. pylori infection. expression was induced in the mkn45 gastric cancer cell line by h. pylori in a manner dependent on the abundance of bacteria. hbd-2-transfected 3t3j2-1 cells secreted hbd-2 protein into the culture medium and this protein inhibited growth of h. pylori completely. the results suggest that hbd-2 may be involved in the pathophysiology of h. pylori-induced gastritis.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against recent clinical isolates of bacteria in korea.
AB  == gemifloxacin is an enhanced-affinity fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. in korea, resistant bacteria are relatively more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. in this study, we studied the in vitro activities of gemifloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and other commonly used antimicrobial agents against 1,689 bacterial strains isolated at four korean university hospitals during 1999-2000.  minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the agar dilution  method of national committee for clinical laboratory standards. gemifloxacin had  the lowest mics for the respiratory pathogens: 90% of streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by 0.06, 0.03, and 0.03 mg/l, respectively. gemifloxacin was more active than the other fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis. the mic90s of gemifloxacin for klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, and non-typhoidal salmonella spp. were 0.25, 1.0, and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, while  those for other gram-negative bacilli were 4-64 mg/l. in conclusion, gemifloxacin was the most active among the comparative agents against gram-positive species, including respiratory pathogens isolated in korea.

TI  == development of broad-range polymerase chain reaction (pcr) bacterial identification in diagnosis of infective endocarditis.
AB  == background and aims of the study: the study aim was to identify the value of broad-range bacterial pcr in infective endocarditis (ie) of bacterial etiology, and to determine its specificity and sensitivity. methods: thirty blood samples were taken for analysis from patients with ie (diagnosed according to duke criteria) and acquired valvular heart disease. two control groups of patients with (n = 10) or without (n = 15) urinary tract infection were defined. dna was isolated, and three different primer pairs for the region of the gene coding for  16s rrna were tested, to determine the most specific pair. amplification products were analyzed with gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and located under uv light. results: positive blood cultures were found in 25 patients with ie. a typical echocardiography picture with bacterial vegetations was found in all patients with sterile blood cultures, and in 20 patients with positive blood cultures. the highest specificity was found for forward/reverse (f/r) primers, as the relevant amplified pcr product was present in all blood samples with ie, and in four of 10 patients with urinary tract infection. conclusion: broad-range pcr in bacterial endocarditis is a rapid, sensitive and inexpensive technique for the detection of bacteria, but is far more prone to contamination than species-specific pcr. however, under controlled conditions, broad-range pcr may be valuable for the identification of non-specific infection, permitting a more rapid clinical diagnosis of endocarditis.

TI  == enterococcal plasmid transfer: sex pheromones, transfer origins, relaxases, and the staphylococcus aureus issue.
AB  == certain conjugative plasmids in enterococcus faecalis encode a mating response to peptide sex pheromones encoded on the chromosome of potential recipient (plasmid-free) strains. the pheromone precursors correspond to the precursors of  surface lipoproteins with the mature peptides coming from the last 7-8 residues of the related signal sequences. processing that gives rise to the pad1-related peptide involves a chromosome-encoded metalloprotease (eep) that is believed to operate within the cytoplasmic membrane. mutations in the determinants for cad1 and cam373, cad and came, respectively, do not affect cell viability; and when the related plasmid is present, the pheromone response is normal. a cam373-like activity is produce by staphylococcus aureus, but the corresponding lipoprotein determinant (cams) is unrelated to the enterococcal determinant (came). pad1 has  two origins of transfer, orit1 and orit2 and encodes a relaxase (trax), which has been shown to specifically nick in orit2. pam373 has a site, orit, that is similar to orit2 of pad1. both sites (orit2 of pad1 and orit of pam373) have a series of short direct repeats (5-6 bp with 5-6 bp-spacings) adjacent to a long inverted repeat (140 bp). the direct repeats differ significantly and confer specificity to the two systems. pad1 and pam373 are both able to mobilize the nonconjugative plasmid pamalpha1, which encodes two relaxases that are involved in transfer. relevant information concerning the possible movement of vancomycin  resistance from e. faecalis to s. aureus in a clinical environment is discussed.

AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  == background: monoclonal (ktmab) and recombinant (ktscfv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, mycobacterium tuberculosis, staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. ktmab and ktscfv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and s. mutans in particular. in this study, the activity of ktmab and ktscfv against s. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by ktmab of dental colonization by s. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. materials and  methods: ktscfv and ktmab were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay against a serotype c strain of s. mutans, and other oral streptococci (s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius). an ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish ktmab potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by s. mutans and other oral streptococci. results: ktmab and ktscfv kill in vitro s. mutans and other oral streptococci. ktmab inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by s. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. conclusions: killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.

TI  == molecular epidemiology of unilateral amyloid arthropathy in broiler breeders associated with enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == although symmetrical polyarticular amyloidosis has been described extensively in  brown layers, spontaneous unilateral amyloid arthropathy has not been described previously in chickens. birds from nine flocks of broiler parent stock (ps) had unilateral lameness associated with severe swelling of the left hock joint and the caudal aspect of the metatarsus. gross pathology was restricted to the left hock joint and the left digital flexor tendons in almost all cases, suggesting an association with administration of marek's disease vaccine. amyloid deposits were found in 83% (25/30) of affected joints by histological examination of congo red  stained sections. systemic amyloidosis, involving mainly the liver and spleen, was found in 59% (10/17) of birds. enterococcus faecalis was isolated from joints in 77% (23/30) of cases and staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the joint in  one case (1/30). thirty-five e. faecalis isolates from joints, tendons and blood  samples from birds in five affected ps flocks were compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) to separate genomic fragments after digestion with smai. all but one isolate had identical or closely related restriction endonuclease digestion (red) patterns that were very similar to a known arthropathic and amyloidogenic e. faecalis isolate. a further 30 e. faecalis isolates from seven grandparent stock (gps) flocks and two isolates from two unaffected ps flocks of the same genetic background were analysed by pfge. among  these isolates, 11 originating from four gps flocks had red patterns identical to or closely related to the reference amyloid-inducing strain. moreover, one e. faecalis isolate from amyloidotic joints of brown layers housed in california, usa was included in the analysis and appeared to be identical to the reference strain. this study showed that the e. faecalis isolates involved in these outbreaks of unilateral amyloid arthropathy in broiler breeders belonged to the same clone as that responsible for outbreaks in brown layers.

TI  == a retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == objective: septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients. extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before hsct to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. the primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. study design: a retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic hsct to treat hematologic malignancies. radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a schei ruler on all teeth. microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or  any body sites. spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. results: radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. during the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. no statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. conclusion: in this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or  mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. a larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of clinically relevant blood culture isolates from nine surgical intensive care units, 1996-2000.
AB  == in order to elucidate trends in the incidence and susceptibility profiles of causative agents of bacteremia/fungemia in nine surgical intensive care units, a  total of 744 isolates obtained during a 5-year period (1996-2000) were studied. the isolates included 698 bacteria and 46 fungi obtained from 523 positive blood  cultures, representing 317 episodes of bacteremia/fungemia. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus accounted for 2.3 episodes per 1000 surgical icu admissions in 1996, 1.6 in 1997, 0.3 in 1998, 0.6 in 1999, and 1.7 in 2000. one enterococcus faecalis (vana) isolate resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin was recovered in 1996. ciprofloxacin resistance in pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased from 36% in 1996 to 20% in 2000, and resistance to third-generation cephalosporins decreased from 40% in 1996 to 9% in 2000. in light of differences  between these results and those found elsewhere, these findings might prove useful for making infection control policy decisions in intensive care units.

TI  == structure-activity studies of 14-helical antimicrobial beta-peptides: probing the relationship between conformational stability and antimicrobial potency.
AB  == antimicrobial alpha-helical alpha-peptides are part of the host-defense mechanism of multicellular organisms and could find therapeutic use against bacteria that are resistant to conventional antibiotics. recent work from hamuro et al. has shown that oligomers of beta-amino acids ("beta-peptides") that can adopt an amphiphilic helix defined by 14-membered ring hydrogen bonds ("14-helix") are active against escherichia coli [hamuro, y.; schneider, j. p.; degrado, w. f. j.  am. chem. soc. 1999, 121, 12200-12201]. we have created two series of cationic 9- and 10-residue amphiphilic beta-peptides to probe the effect of 14-helix stability on antimicrobial and hemolytic activity. 14-helix stability within these series is modulated by varying the proportions of rigid trans-2-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (achc) residues and flexible acyclic residues. we have previously shown that a high proportion of achc residues in short beta-peptides encourages 14-helical structure in aqueous solution [appella, d. h.; barchi, j. j.; durell, s. r.; gellman, s. h. j. am. chem. soc. 1999, 121,  2309-2310]. circular dichroism of the beta-peptides described here reveals a broad range of 14-helix population in aqueous buffer, but this variation in helical propensity does not lead to significant changes in antibiotic activity against a set of four bacteria. several of the 9-mers display antibiotic activity comparable to that of a synthetic magainin derivative. among these 9-mers, hemolytic activity increases slightly with increasing 14-helical propensity, but  all of the 9-mers are less hemolytic than the magainin derivative. previous studies with conventional peptides (alpha-amino acid residues) have provided conflicting evidence on the relationship between helical propensity and antimicrobial activity. this uncertainty has arisen because alpha-helix stability can be varied to only a limited extent among linear alpha-peptides without modifying parameters important for antimicrobial activity (e.g., net charge or hydrophobicity); a much greater range of helical stability is accessible with beta-peptides. for example, it is very rare for a linear alpha-peptide to display significant alpha-helix formation in aqueous solution and manifest antibacterial  activity, while the linear beta-peptides described here range from fully unfolded to very highly folded in aqueous solution. this study shows that beta-peptides can be unique tools for analyzing relationships between conformational stability  and biological activity.

TI  == [survey on drug resistance to ciprofloxacin in common pathogenic bacteria].
AB  == objective: to obtain primary knowledge of drug resistance to ciprofloxacin in the common pathogenic bacteria in this hospital thereby to bring the situation under  control. methods: a total of 3 800 strains of pathogenic bacteria were isolated from in-patients from 1997 to 2000, and drug resistance of these strains to ciprofloxacin was examined. results: during the past 4 years, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis were found to be highly resistant to ciprofloxacin with the rates still on the rise from 50%, 25.6% and 40.3% in 1997 to 62.2%, 53.4% and 63.6% respectively in 2000. over 40%  of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter were resistant to ciprofloxacin and the percentages for pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter reached 31.1% to 34.0% in 2000. among the 189 strains of the pathogenic bacteria  isolated from patients with sustained infection in our hospital in 2000, over 70% of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis were identified as having resistance to ciprofloxacin. conclusion: the percentages of common pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to ciprofloxacin have been considerably high and tend to increase further. ciprofloxacin abuse needs to be given appropriate attention.

TI  == the icest1 element of streptococcus thermophilus belongs to a large family of integrative and conjugative elements that exchange modules and change their specificity of integration.
AB  == the 34,734-bp element icest1 from streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 is site-specifically integrated into the 3(') end of the gene fda. icest1 encodes integrative functions and putative transfer functions. six proteins of the putative conjugative system of icest1 are related to those encoded by the conjugative transposon tn916 from enterococcus faecalis. a comparison of these proteins with those encoded by the complete or partial genome sequences of various low g+c bacteria including bacillus subtilis, clostridium difficile, e. faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus mutans revealed the presence of numerous putative site-specific integrative conjugative  elements and/or conjugative transposons within these genomes. sequence comparisons revealed that these elements possess a modular structure and that exchanges of unrelated or distantly related modules and genes have occurred between these elements, and also plasmids and prophages. these exchanges have probably led to modifications in the site specificity of integration of these elements. therefore, a distinction between low specificity integrative conjugative elements (i.e., conjugative transposons) and site-specific integrative conjugative elements does not appear to be relevant. we propose to call all the conjugative elements that excise by site-specific recombination and  integrate by recombination between a specific site of a circular intermediate and another site, "integrative and conjugative elements" (ices), irrespective of the  integration specificity.

TI  == patterns of isolation of common gram positive bacterial pathogens and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents in jimma hospital.
AB  == gram positive bacteria are frequently emerging as antibiotic resistant pathogens, causing serious infections than ever before in the ill and debilitated patients.  the pattern of isolation and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of common gram positive cocci including staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons), streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus species and streptococcus pneumoniae was investigated between january 1997 and june 2000 in jimma hospital. of the 500 specimens collected from children and adults, 116 (23.2%) consisted of one or more of the above organisms. the following strains: staphylococcus aureus, 47 (40.5%), cons, 36 (31.0%), streptococcus pneumoniae, 26 (22.4%) streptococcus pyogenes, 5 (4.3%) and streptococcus faecalis, 2(1.7%) were isolated from different specimens including pus, sputum, urine, stool, blood and oro/nasopharyngeal swabs of patients. the in vitro activities of 14 different antibiotics including penicillin g, ampicillin, cloxacillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, methicillin, vancomycin and clindamycin was determined against the clinical bacterial isolates. the antimicrobial activities were evaluated by agar diffusion technique using mueller-hinton agar according to nccls recommendations. the majority of the pathogens, 59(50.9%) were recovered from upper respiratory tract infections and 17 (14.6%) from the lower respiratory tract. the resistance patterns of s. aureus, cons, s. pneumoniae and enterococci to penicillin was 91.5%, 94.4%, 7.7%  and 100% respectively. penicillin, ampicillin and cloxacillin showed low effects  (< 60%) on both s. aureus and cons. multi-drug resistance was observed in all the gram-positive isolates, especially higher in staphylococcus species. all isolates of s. aureus (100%) were susceptible to vancomycin, clindamycin and gentamicin. in order to reduce morbidity and mortality due to antibiotic resistance susceptibility testing should be performed for the proper management of bacterial infections. this entails the need for national surveillance to monitor antibiotic resistance in bacteria by susceptibility testing using reliable methods.

TI  == [interpretative reading of the antibiogram in gram-positive cocci].
AB  == resistance to methicillin in staphylococcus is related to expression of the gene  meca, and implies resistance to all beta-lactams. breakpoints for interpretation  of this mechanism differ in s. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. in relation to macrolides-lincosamides-streptograminsb, the most frequent mechanism  among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump nora determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences on the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. strains of s. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (gisa strains) have been recently described. in spain, there is a high percentage of s. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage  of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, because  of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. the most frequent phenotype of resistance to macrolides in this species is caused by methylase production. resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is related to the mechanisms previously indicated for staphylococcus, but clinical interpretation of the antibiograma for this organism is even more complex. no strains of s. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. in spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in s. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. e. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to e. faecium. enterococci show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes became resistant to the combination. glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in our country, but several genotypes, of which vana is the most relevant from a clinical point of view, have been described in other regions.

TI  == discovery of a novel and potent class of fabi-directed antibacterial agents.
AB  == bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein (acp) reductase (fabi) catalyzes the final step in each elongation cycle of bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis and is an attractive target for the development of new antibacterial agents. high-throughput screening of the staphylococcus aureus fabi enzyme identified a novel, weak inhibitor with no detectable antibacterial activity against s. aureus. iterative medicinal chemistry and x-ray crystal structure-based design led to the identification of compound 4 [(e)-n-methyl-n-(2-methyl-1h-indol-3-ylmethyl)-3-(7-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,8-na phthyridin-3-yl)acrylamide], which is 350-fold more potent than the original lead compound obtained by high-throughput screening in the fabi inhibition assay. compound 4 has exquisite antistaphylococci activity, achieving mics at which 90%  of isolates are inhibited more than 500 times lower than those of nine currently  available antibiotics against a panel of multidrug-resistant strains of s. aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. furthermore, compound 4 exhibits excellent in vivo efficacy in an s. aureus infection model in rats. biochemical and genetic approaches have confirmed that the mode of antibacterial action of compound 4 and related compounds is via inhibition of fabi. compound 4 also exhibits weak fabk inhibitory activity, which may explain its antibacterial activity against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, which depend on fabk and both fabk and fabi, respectively, for their enoyl-acp reductase function. these results show that compound 4 is representative of a new, totally synthetic series of antibacterial agents that has the potential to provide novel alternatives for  the treatment of s. aureus infections that are resistant to our present armory of antibiotics.

TI  == the antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  == background: retinoids such as retinoic acid (ra), retinol (rol) and retinaldehyde (ral) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. aim: to analyse the potential anti-infective  activities of topical rol, ral and ra. methods: microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of rol, ral and ra were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus flavus, propionibacterium acnes, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus hominis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, streptococcus group b, enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and pseudomonas/klebsiella. in two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% ral or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% ral or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. results: of the three retinoids tested, only ral showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like s. aeureus, micrococcus spp. or  p. acnes. no activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. these results on  reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. mic(50) and mic(90) values for ral were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive s. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant s. aureus. the two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with ral had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. in the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2)  for p. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. no resistant bacteria were  found after 2 weeks of topical use. preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of ral is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. conclusion: we have shown that ral differs from parent natural retinoids such as rol and ra in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. this activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the  potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.

TI  == bacterial inactivation by high-pressure homogenisation and high hydrostatic pressure.
AB  == the resistance of five gram-positive bacteria, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus plantarum, listeria innocua and leuconostoc  dextranicum, and six gram-negative bacteria, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas fluorescens  and two strains of escherichia coli, to high-pressure homogenisation (100-300 mpa) and to high hydrostatic pressure (200-400 mpa) was compared in this study. within the group of gram-positive bacteria and within the group of gram-negative  bacteria, large differences were observed in resistance to high hydrostatic pressure, but not to high-pressure homogenisation. all gram-positive bacteria were more resistant than any of the gram-negative bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation, while in relative to high hydrostatic pressure resistance both groups overlapped. within the group of gram-negative bacteria, there also existed another order in resistance to high-pressure homogenisation than to high hydrostatic pressure. further it appears that the mutant e. coli lmm1010, which is resistant to high hydrostatic pressure is not more resistant to high-pressure  homogenisation than its parental strain mg1655. the preceding observations indicate a different response of the test bacteria to high-pressure homogenisation compared to high hydrostatic pressure treatment, which suggests that the underlying inactivation mechanisms for both techniques are different. further, no sublethal injury could be observed upon high-pressure homogenisation  of y. enterocolitica and s. aureus cell population by using low ph (5.5 7), nacl  (0 6%) or sds (0-100 mg/l) as selective components in the plating medium. finally, it was observed that successive rounds of high-pressure homogenisation have an additive effect on viability reduction of y. enterocolitica and s. aureus.

TI  == bacterial survival on radiographic cassettes.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to report the life span of escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus on 3 types of radiographic  imaging receptors currently used in diagnostic imaging departments in the united  states. kodak 400 speed, dupont 400 speed and fuji computed radiography cassettes were inoculated with the 3 bacteria, then placed in an incubation cabinet and cultured for a period of 2 weeks. all 3 cassettes revealed confluent growth with  no noticeable reduction in bacterial numbers for the entire test period. this study verifies that common potentially pathogenic bacteria can survive for prolonged periods on radiographic imaging cassettes. therefore, effective cleaning regimens are of fundamental importance in controlling and preventing potential nosocomial transmission in the diagnostic imaging department.

TI  == influence of mucin on the activity of the antiseptic lavasept against staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == background: lavasept, containing the polymeric biguanide polyhexanide, may be effective against staphylococcus aureus colonizing the nasal mucosa. to obtain basic data on its suitability for that purpose, its antimicrobial activity was examined in the presence of mucin. methods: a disk diffusion test was applied using mueller-hinton agar, and disks soaked with a therapeutic and a 10-fold higher concentration of lavasept. commercially available mucin preparations from  porcine stomach were added to the test system. reference strains and 20 clinically isolates of s. aureus, and reference strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, and candida albicans were tested.  results: supplementation of the test medium with 1% mucin completely abolished the activity of disks loaded with the therapeutically used concentration of the antiseptic. the neutralizing effect of mucin occurred with all test strains. conclusions: the inactivation of lavasept by mucin may hamper a reliable clearance of nasal s. aureus carriage.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of imipenem against isolates from complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  == antimicrobial activity of imipenem was measured using 4725 strains isolated from  patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cutis) between 1988 and 2000. imipenem was inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecium and some non-fermenting gram-negative rods. resistant strains (mic>16 mg/l) were observed in staphylococcus haemolyticus (22%), enterococcus faecalis (4%), enterococcus avium (8%), serratia marcescens (5%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). although the prevalence of imipenem-resistant strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa was sporadically high in some years, no steady increase was seen over  the period. resistant strains were rare in other major uropathogenic species. these results suggest that imipenem is still one of the most reliable antimicrobial drugs.

TI  == transfer origins in the conjugative enterococcus faecalis plasmids pad1 and pam373: identification of the pad1 nic site, a specific relaxase and a possible trag-like protein.
AB  == the enterococcus faecalis conjugative plasmids pad1 and pam373 encode a mating response to the peptide sex pheromones cad1 and cam373 respectively. sequence determination of both plasmids has recently been completed with strong similarity evident over many of the structural genes related to conjugation. pad1 has two origins of transfer, with orit1 being located within the repa determinant, whereas the more efficiently utilized orit2 is located between orf53 and orf57, two genes found in the present study to be essential for conjugation. we have found a similarly located orit to be present in pam373. orit2 corresponds to about 285 bp based on its ability to facilitate mobilization by pad1 when ligated to the shuttle vector pam401; however, it was not mobilized by pam373. in contrast, a similarly ligated fragment containing the orit of pam373 did not facilitate mobilization by pad1 but was efficiently mobilized by pam373. the orit sites of the two plasmids each contained a homologous large inverted repeat (spanning about 140 bp) adjacent to a series of non-homologous short (6 bp) direct repeats. a hybrid construction containing the inverted repeat of pam373 and direct repeats of pad1 was mobilized efficiently by pad1 but not by pam373, indicating a significantly greater degree of specificity is associated with the direct repeats. mutational (deletion) analyses of the pad1 orit2 inverted repeat  structure suggested its importance in facilitating transfer or perhaps ligation of the ends of the newly transferred dna strand. analyses showed that orf57 (to be called trax) is the relaxase, which was found to induce a specific nick in the large inverted repeat inside orit; the protein also facilitated site-specific recombination between two orit2 sites. orf53 (to be called traw) exhibits certain structural similarities to trag-like proteins, although there is little overall homology.

TI  == in vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin and cefepime, alone and in combination with various antimicrobials, against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model.
AB  == use of combinations of antimicrobials that together achieve synergistic activities against targeted microorganisms is one potential strategy for overcoming bacterial resistance. as the incidence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant staphylococci and enterococci increases, the importance of devising additional synergistic drug combinations for these bacteria is magnified. we evaluated a number of antimicrobial combinations, with a focus on quinupristin-dalfopristin (q-d), cefepime, and linezolid, using a previously described in vitro pharmacodynamic model. the combination of q-d with either linezolid or vancomycin, as well as the combination of cefepime-vancomycin, resulted in enhanced killing (> or =2-log(10) increase in killing versus the most-active single agent) against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 494. an improved effect (<2 log(10) kill increase in kill) against mrsa 494 was noted for cefepime plus either q-d or linezolid, as well as linezolid-vancomycin. similar relationships were observed for a methicillin-susceptible s. aureus isolate (isolate 1199). against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis r444, enhanced killing was achieved with the combination of cefepime-linezolid, while improvement was noted for vancomycin with either cefepime or linezolid. the combination of cefepime and vancomycin also achieved enhanced killing against a glycopeptide-intermediate-susceptible s. aureus isolate (isolate 992). the combination of linezolid and doxycycline achieved an enhanced effect against vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vrefc) and e. faecium. q-d plus ampicillin or linezolid resulted in similar enhancement of activity against the vrefc isolate. the results of this study suggest a number of novel antimicrobial combinations that may be useful against staphylococci and enterococci. combination regimens including cefepime, q-d, and/or linezolid warrant further investigation for the treatment of refractive infections due to multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens.

TI  == prevalence of and resistance to anti-microbial drugs in selected microbial species isolated from bulk milk samples.
AB  == the prevalence of strains of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative (cn) staphylococci, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and bacillus cereus, was investigated in 111 bulk milk samples. staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 38 samples, cn staphylococci from 63 samples, e. coli from 49 samples, e. faecalis or e. faecium from 107 samples, and l. monocytogenes from two samples. bacillus cereus was not found in any of the samples and three samples were free of any of the selected species. sensitivity to the anti-microbial drugs amikacin, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cephalothin (clt), cephotaxime, clindamycin, chloramphenicol (cmp), co-trimoxazole, erythromycin (ery), gentamicin, neomycin, norfloxacin, oxacillin, penicillin, streptomycin (str), tetracycline (ttc) and vancomycin was tested using the standard dilution technique. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) characteristics (mic50, mic90, mic range) were determined for each microbial species. resistance against one or more anti-microbial drugs was found in 93% of  s. aureus, 40% of cn staphylococci, 73% of e. coli, 88% of e.faecalis, 55% of e.faecium, and one l. monocytogenes strain. most of the strains, particularly enterococci, were resistant to str, ttc, and ery (mic50 4 microg/ml). a high percentage of staphylococci were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. high resistance to clt was found in 11 strains of e. coli (mic 256 microg/ml) and strains resistant to cmp (mic90 16 microg/ml) were detected. the highest numbers  of resistance phenotypes were found in e. coil (16) and cn staphylococci (12). eighteen identical resistance phenotypes were demonstrated in indicator bacteria  (e. coli, e. faecalis, e. faecium) and pathogens (s. aureus, cn staphylococci) isolated from the same bulk milk sample. the obtained resistance data were matched against the herd owners' information on therapeutic use of the drugs. this confrontation could not explain the findings of strains resistant to ery or  cmp. our findings are evidence of selection of resistant strains among not only pathogenic agents, but also among indicator bacteria which can become significant carriers of transmissible resistance genes.

TI  == remarkable substituent effects on antimicrobial activities of 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium salts.
AB  == in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of a series of 25 diazolidinium  salts, 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium (1), together with 1,3-dialkylpyrimidinium (2), were evaluated against standard strains: escherichia coli (atcc 25922), staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 12228), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), enterobacter cloacae (atcc 13047), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853) and candida albicans (atcc 10239). selective  and effective antibacterial activity against one gram-negative (p. aeruginosa) and two gram-positive (e. faecalis and s. aureus) bacteria were found in salts 1a, 1i and 1j, in contrast to modest to poor activity observed in the rest of the salts. the enhanced antibacterial activity is clearly linked to the introduction  of two bulky mesityl or mesitylbenzyl substituents on the nitrogen atoms of the imidazoline skeleton, while the side chain of the backbone of the molecule has no influence.

AB  == the activity of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, was tested against 862 gram-positive cocci isolated in italy and compared with the activities of 12 antibiotics. overall, mic90s for linezolid (2-4 mg/l) indicated an in vitro activity comparable to that of vancomycin in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (4 mg/l), s. epidermidis (2 mg/l) and methicillin-susceptible strains. enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to linezolid (mic90 2-4 mg/l), glycopeptides and beta-lactams. in e. faecium, only glycopeptides (mic90 2 mg/l)  and linezolid (mic90 2 mg/l) were active. linezolid was the only drug active against two strains of enterococcus showing a vana phenotype. owing to its antibacterial profile, linezolid represents a promising drug for the treatment of gram-positive infections.

AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 127), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 123), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), enterococcus faecium (n = 50), enterococcus avium (n = 50), and peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros, p. prevotii; n = 125). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also  observed with ceftazidime (caz), cpr, cfpm, fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. the decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual mic range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.

TI  == a multicenter evaluation of linezolid antimicrobial activity in north america.
AB  == overall, 141 centers in north america enrolled in this international surveillance study designed to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and spectrum of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone. each participant tested the susceptibility of clinical isolates of staphylococcal species (n = 85) against 12 drugs, and enterococcal species (n = 40) against 6 drugs using reference broth microdilution trays; and of streptococcal species (n = 25) against 6 drugs using etests (ab biodisk, solna, sweden). quality control testing was conducted using recommended  strains, and verification of resistance to linezolid and select other agents was  performed by a regional monitor. of the 20,161 isolates collected from sites across the united states (us; n = 132) and canada (n = 9), 18,307 were included in this analysis. oxacillin resistance occurred in 38.7 and 70.6% of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal (cons) isolates, respectively. vancomycin resistance was reported in 65.9 and 2.6% of enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis, respectively. penicillin resistance occurred in 37.2% of streptococcus pneumoniae, 17.5% constituting high-level resistance (mic, > or =2  microg/ml). the mic(90) for linezolid was 1 microg/ml for streptococci, 2 microg/ml for enterococci and cons isolates, and 4 microg/ml for s. aureus. using the us fda-recommended susceptible breakpoints for linezolid, there were no confirmed reports of linezolid resistance (i.e., mic > or =8 microg/ml). the occurrence of linezolid mics was unimodal and generally varied between, 1-4 microg/ml for staphylococci (94% of recorded results), 1-2 microg/ml for enterococci (93%), and 0.5-1 microg/ml for streptococci (85%). susceptibility to  linezolid was not influenced by susceptibility to other antiicrobials such as vancomycin, beta-lactams or macrolides. only linezolid was universally active against essentially all tested gram-positive specimens. the unimodal susceptibility pattern is indicative of excellent and near complete activity against key gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains, but surveillance for emerging resistances (rare) and the performance of routine susceptibility tests to guide patient therapy seems prudent.

TI  == an enterococcus faecalis abc homologue (lsa) is required for the resistance of this species to clindamycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis isolates are resistant to clindamycin (cli) and quinupristin-dalfopristin (q-d), and this is thought to be a species characteristic. disruption of a gene (abc-23, now designated lsa, for "lincosamide and streptogramin a resistance") of e. faecalis was associated with  a > or =40-fold decrease in mics of q-d (to 0.75 microg/ml), cli (to 0.12 to 0.5  microg/ml), and dalfopristin (dal) (to 4 to 8 microg/ml) for the wild-type e. faecalis parental strain (q-d mic, 32 microg/ml; cli mic, 32 to 48 microg/ml; dal mic, 512 microg/ml). complementation of the disruption mutant with lsa on a shuttle plasmid resulted in restoration of the mics of cli, q-d, and dal to wild-type levels. under high-stringency conditions, lsa was found in 180 of 180 isolates of e. faecalis but in none of 189 other enterococci. among 19 erm(b)-lacking enterococcus faecium strains, 9 (47%) were highly susceptible to cli (mic, 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml) and had dal mics of 4 to 16 microg/ml; for the  remaining erm(b)-lacking e. faecium strains, the cli and dal mics were 4 to > 256 and 2 to > 128 microg/ml, respectively. in contrast, none of 32 erm(b)-lacking e. faecalis strains were susceptible (cli mic range, 16 to 32 microg/ml; dal mic range, > or =32 microg/ml). when lsa was introduced into an e. faecium strain initially susceptible to cli, the mics of cli and dal increased > or =60-fold and that of q-d increased 6-fold (to 3 to 6 microg/ml). introduction of lsa into two  dal-resistant (mics, > 128 microg/ml), q-d-susceptible (mics, 0.5 and 1.5 microg/ml) e. faecium strains (cli mics, 12 and >256 microg/ml) resulted in an increase in the q-d mics from 3- to 10-fold (to 8 and >32 microg/ml), respectively. although efflux was not studied, the similarity (41 to 64%) of the  predicted lsa protein to abc proteins such as vga(a), vga(b), and msr(a) of staphylococcus aureus and yjca of lactococcus lactis and the presence of walker a and b atp-binding motifs suggest that this resistance may be related to efflux of these antibiotics. in conclusion, lsa appears to be an intrinsic gene of e. faecalis that explains the characteristic resistance of this species to cli and q-d.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction as a sensitive and rapid method for specific detection  of mycoplasma pneumoniae in clinical samples.
AB  == the fast diagnosis of mycoplasma primary atypical pneumonia is impaired by the lack of routinely available culture methods for isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniae from clinical specimens. likewise, serological methods commonly used for diagnosis are insensitive and non-specific. in this study, we have established and applied the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique to detect m. pneumoniae dna in clinical samples originating from the respiratory tract. the pcr results were compared with those from culture and serology tests. to standardize the detection of m. pneumoniae by pcr, we first used dna from culture grown organisms and clinical samples seeded with m. pneumoniae. pcr amplification was performed with m. pneumoniae-specific primers to amplify 144, 153 and 631 bp  dna fragments by using primer pairs mp5-1/mp5-2, p1-178/p1-331 and p1-178/p1-809, respectively. the amplification of the 631 bp dna fragment was found to be most sensitive for the detection of m. pneumoniae. using the most sensitive pcr, a total of 47 respiratory specimens from patients suspected of community acquired pneumonia were tested. while none of the specimens were positive for m. pneumoniae in culture, 6 specimens gave positive results by pcr. in 4 out of the  5 pcr positive samples tested serologically, the results were supported by elevated levels of anti-mycoplasma igg/igm/iga. thus, these results suggest that  pcr is the most sensitive method to detect m. pneumoniae in clinical specimens.

TI  == identification and characterization of genes encoding sex pheromone cam373 activity in enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the sex pheromone cam373 of enterococcus faecalis and the related staph-cam373 of staphylococcus aureus were found to correspond to heptapeptides located within the c-termini of the signal sequences of putative prelipoproteins. the deduced mature forms of the lipoproteins share no detectable homology and presumably serve unrelated functions in the cells. the chromosomally encoded genetic determinants for production of the pheromones have been identified and designated came (encoding cam373) and cams (encoding staph-cam373). truncated and full-length clones of came were generated in escherichia coli, in which cam373 activity was expressed. in e. faecalis, insertional inactivation in the middle of came had no detectable phenotypic effects on the pheromone system. establishment  of an in frame translation stop codon within the signal sequence resulted in reduction of cam373 activity to 3% of normal levels. the cams determinant has homologues in staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis and listeria monocytogenes; however, corresponding heptapeptides present within those sequences do not resemble staph-cam373 closely. the particular significance of staph-cam373 as a potential intergeneric inducer of transfer-proficient genetic elements is discussed.

AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

AB  == a study was conducted to evaluate the new vitek 2 system (biomerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (n = 100), enterococcus spp. (n = 89), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the id-gpc identification card and with the ast-p515 (for staphylococci), ast-p516 (for enterococci and s. agalactiae) and ast-p506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. the identification comparison methods were the api staph for staphylococci and the api 20 strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) was used. the vitek 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of s. aureus, 96.5% of s. agalactiae, 96.9% of s. pneumoniae, 92.7% of enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). more than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. according to the nccls breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the vitek 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for s. aureus, from 90 to 100% for cns, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for s. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for s. pneumoniae. microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were cns-erythromycin, cns-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. major errors were observed for cns-oxacillin and s. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. in conclusion the results of this study indicate that the vitek 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial sensitivity for czop were  also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen  species (1,913 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 178), methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse; n = 98), methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse; n = 164), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), enterococcus faecium (n  = 91), enterococcus avium (n = 72), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp; n = 100), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp; n = 29), streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). czop possessed comparable antibacterial activities against mssa and msse to other cephems, and was also effective on mrse but not on mrsa. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. czop, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. an antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (cpr) and higher than other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, just like other drugs. an antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (ctm), cefepime (cfpm) and cpr, and that against s. agalactiae was also preferable. czop and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against s. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. an antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, ctm and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint mic of czop was 96.5% in mrsa, 93.1% in prsp, 60.0% in  pisp, 40.3% in s. haemolyticus, 22.3% in e. faecalis, and 15.9% in mrse. those resistance ratios were similar to those for cfpm, but e. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. in conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria was observed. the sensitivities of pisp and prsp to czop, however, was suggested to be decreasing.

TI  == nb2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  == enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ecta) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. we present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ecta compounds, nb2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of nb2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) nb2001 is a substrate for tem-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/k(m)) of greater than 77,000 m-1 s-1. (ii) triclosan is detected in nb2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli but not in e. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) nb2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing e. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. nb2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae. nb2001 is also active against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae.  the results indicate that nb2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent  and demonstrate the potential of ecta in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.

TI  == proficiency of italian clinical laboratories in detecting reduced glycopeptide susceptibility in enterococcus and staphylococcus spp. using routine laboratory methodologies.
AB  == objective: to assess the ability of 59 clinical microbiology laboratories distributed throughout italy to correctly identify and detect reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides in staphylococci and vana-, vanb- or vanc-mediated glycopeptide resistance in enterococci. methods: eight test strains comprising three staphylococci (s. aureus atcc 29212 and two vancomycin-intermediate s. haemolyticus [11105301, 10030683y]) and five enterococci (e. faecalis atcc 29212, e. faecalis atcc 51299 vanb, e. faecium aib40 vana, e. faecalis v583 vanb and e. gallinarum aib39 vanc1) were distributed to 59 italian clinical microbiology laboratories. each isolate was blind-coded, and laboratories were instructed to identify the strains and test isolates for susceptibility to teicoplanin and vancomycin using their standard methods. results were assessed against consensus test results obtained by a reference laboratory. in addition, to complement data interpretation, laboratories were asked to provide retrospective routine test results from their respective hospitals. results: all 59 laboratories participating in the study completed the  susceptibility testing and provided data for analysis. a total of 53 laboratories provided retrospective routine data. overall, laboratories were able to identify  isolates to the genus level successfully. e. gallinarum and s. haemolyticus posed problems for species identification, with only 40.6 and 71.2%, respectively, of results reported correctly; most incorrect results were reported as 'other species'. for enterococcal test strains, vana phenotypes were detected correctly  by 96.6% of laboratories; vanb by 30.5% (e. faecalis atcc 51299) and 88.1% (e. faecalis v583); and vanc1 by 67.8%. for staphylococcal test strains, 28.8% (s. haemolyticus 11105301) and 23.7% (s. haemolyticus 10030683y) of the laboratories  were able to detect reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. errors in detecting vancomycin resistance in vanb and vanc1 enterococci were made with all methods, most noticeably by disk diffusion users. for staphylococci, most errors in reporting vancomycin-intermediate resistance occurred with disk diffusion and vitek (software version 5.04) users. overall, considerably fewer errors occurred  with the detection of teicoplanin resistance, especially for staphylococci. for 1999, routine results show that 41/1749 (2.4%) of e. faecium, 220/11 180 (2.0%) of e. faecalis, 29/24 927 (0.12%) of s. aureus and 54/22 102 (0.24%) of coagulase-negative staphylococci were reported as resistant to vancomycin. conclusion: italian laboratories are able to identify staphylococci and enterococci adequately, although all methodologies used have problems in identifying e. gallinarum and coagulase-negative staphylococci to the species level. while vana phenotypes were efficiently detected, problems were experienced in detecting vanb and vanc phenotypes. the majority of laboratories were unable to detect reduced vancomycin susceptibility in staphylococci adequately, especially with disk diffusion and older vitek systems. teicoplanin appeared useful as a marker for detecting vancomycin resistance, particularly with disk diffusion. should enterococcal vanb or staphylococcal glycopeptide-intermediate phenotypes become prevalent in italy, it is likely that they would be under-detected. new systems under development, such as vitek2, should improve this situation.

TI  == investigating the bacterial barrier properties of four contemporary wound dressings.
AB  == the ability of four wound dressings (combiderm, allevyn hydrocellular, tegaderm and tielle) to resist penetration of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated in vitro using a dedicated test apparatus. with the exception of tielle, each dressing prevented bacterial transmission over an 11-day challenge period. when both the wound contact surface and the external surface of tielle were directly challenged with a bacterial suspension, penetration of the dressing was observed within three to five days. the breakdown of its outer membrane could explain the inability of tielle to maintain a barrier to the passage of the test  bacteria used in this wound model. on the basis of these data, combiderm, allevyn hydrocellular and tegaderm dressings may facilitate infection control by acting as a physical barrier to the transmission of potentially pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant wound bacteria. however, further research is urgently required to determine whether or not the same results are observed in clinical practice.

TI  == grepafloxacin: pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration.
AB  == pharmacokinetic and tissue penetration studies of grepafloxacin, a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, show that it has useful properties for the treatment of respiratory tract infections. grepafloxacin has a volume of distribution that is larger than those of many of the other fluoroquinolones and  is concentrated in alveolar macrophages, bronchial mucosa and epithelial lining fluid to a greater extent than are certain other fluoroquinolones. grepafloxacin  concentrations achieved in plasma after a 400-mg oral dose are well in excess of  those required to inhibit the respiratory pathogens staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis. streptococcus pneumoniae is also covered for most of the dosing interval, but at normal dose levels grepafloxacin might not inhibit enterococcus faecalis. the maximum plasma concentrations and area under the concentration---time curve achieved with grepafloxacin suggest that it will be effective for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. the pharmacokinetics of fluoroquinolones are among their most useful properties. the  aim of this paper is to demonstrate whether the differences between grepafloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones are of therapeutic significance.

TI  == the migration of proteus mirabilis and other urinary tract pathogens over foley catheters.
AB  == objective: to examine the ability of organisms that infect the catheterized urinary tract to migrate over the surfaces of foley catheters. materials and methods: in a simple laboratory model, organisms were challenged to migrate across sections of hydrogel-coated latex, hydrogel/silver-coated latex, silicone-coated latex and all-silicone catheters. the sections (1 cm long) were placed as bridges in channels between blocks of agar and the test organisms inoculated onto the agar adjacent to one side of each bridge. the plates were incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h and examined for growth of the test organisms  on the agar on the other side of the bridges. a collection of swarming, swimming  and nonmotile species were tested in the model. the relative mobilities of the test organisms were expressed as migration indices, calculated as the percentage  of tests in which bacterial migration was observed over each type of catheter bridge. results: the swarmer cells of proteus mirabilis and p. vulgaris migrated  successfully (migration indices of 73-100) over all four types of catheter. the migration index of serratia marcescens swarmers was reduced to 33 over the silver-coated catheters, but these cells crossed over the other catheter surfaces with ease (indices of 100). pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most mobile of the swimming, non-swarming organisms with indices of 70-22, but this group was less capable of migration than the swarmers. indices were 0-33 for nonmotile organisms. the mean migration indices for the nine species for each type of catheter were 57 (hydrogel-coated latex), 49 (silver/hydrogel-coated latex), 41 (silicone-coated latex) and 35 (all-silicone). the swarmer cells of p. mirabilis  moved through populations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, and then migrated over sections  of hydrogel-coated latex catheters with little or no reduction in migration index. they were also capable of transporting the nonmotile cells of k. pneumoniae and s. aureus over the catheters. the migration index of p. mirabilis  swarmers was substantially reduced in the presence of ps. aeruginosa and s. marcescens. conclusions: hydrogel coatings facilitate the migration of urinary tract pathogens over catheter surfaces. with the exception of s. marcescens, the  incorporation of silver into the hydrogel did not inhibit migration. swarmer cells were particularly effective at moving over catheters and p. mirabilis swarmers were also capable of transporting other species. this suggests that inhibitors of swarming could be useful in controlling catheter-associated infection and the complications resulting from the spread of bacterial biofilm over catheters.

AB  == background and aim of the study: prosthetic valve endocarditis (pve) is a relatively uncommon but very serious condition. as bacterial colonization of the  prosthetic heart valve sewing cuff can be a prelude to the clinical occurrence of pve, antimicrobial coating of the sewing cuff may be beneficial. the study aims were to examine the antimicrobial activity in vitro and anti-infective efficacy in vivo of prosthetic heart valve sewing cuffs coated with minocycline and rifampin. methods: zones of inhibition by antimicrobial-coated sewing cuffs were  assessed in vitro against staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the ability of subcutaneously implanted devices coated with minocycline and rifampin to resist colonization and infection by p. aeruginosa was also examined in a rabbit model.  results: antimicrobial-coated sewing cuffs produced zones of inhibition against all tested organisms. coated devices were significantly less likely than uncoated devices to become colonized (2/24; 8% versus 20/24; 83%; p <0.001) or to cause device-related infection (0/24; 0% versus 18/24; 75%; p <0.001) and device-related abscess (0/24; 0% versus 10/24; 42%; p <0.001) due to p. aeruginosa. conclusion: prosthetic heart valve sewing cuffs coated with minocycline and rifampin provide broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro,  and are anti-infective in vivo against p. aeruginosa. these results encourage the clinical evaluation of these sewing cuffs.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of resveratrol on dermatophytes and bacterial pathogens of the skin.
AB  == the phytoalexin resveratrol is commonly found in food and drinks, including red wine, grapes, and peanuts. many studies have shown that this compound has anti-inflammatory properties, and it has been ascribed as having health benefits  that help to prevent cancer and coronary heart disease. a treatment that combines antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory actions may be desirable for alleviating many skin conditions that range in severity. therefore, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of resveratrol against bacteria and dermatophytes that are major etiologic agents of human skin infections. using the broth microdilution protocol of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) m7-a5, growth of the bacterial species staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was inhibited at 171-342 microg/ml of resveratrol in the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide. using the nccls protocol m38-p, activity against the  fungal species trichophyton mentagrophytes, trichophyton tonsurans, trichophyton  rubrum, epidermophyton floccosum, and microsporum gypseum was also tested. the growth of dermatophytes was inhibited at 25-50 microg/ml of resveratrol. thus, this study indicates a novel application for resveratrol, a molecule of plant defense, to combat human fungal pathogens. resveratrol and its analogs may have wide application to skin conditions that afflict a significant portion of our population, and may also have promising clinical potentials in diabetic wounds.

AB  == objective: to assess antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women as compared to the most common bacterial agents related to vaginosis. study design: antagonistic activity of different lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women not treated for  infections with an antibiotic for the previous three months was screened using an agar slab method. the activity was tested against test organisms associated with  bacterial vaginosis and/or urinary tract infections: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella bivia. results: many of the 146 lactobacillus strains tested exerted apparent antagonistic activities against gram-positive aerobic cocci and gram-negative rods, such as s aureus and  e coli, and a marked number of lactobacillus strains inhibited facultative bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis and the anaerobes p anaerobius and p bivia. only a few lactobacilli were able to inhibit growth of e faecalis and s agalactiae. indicator bacteria growth inhibition probably relies upon several different complementary mechanisms. the specific indicator bacteria species determines which mechanism predominates. conclusion: lactobacillus strains taken  from normal vaginal flora demonstrated antagonistic activity against a variety of bacteria related to vaginal and urinary tract infections. the specific occurrence rates of active lactobacillus strains are different, and this difference is dependent on the indicator bacteria species.

TI  == clinafloxacin versus piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of severe skin and  soft-tissue infections in adults at a veterans affairs medical center.
AB  == background: severe skin and soft-tissue infections (sstis), particularly diabetic foot infections, are a source of considerable morbidity and mortality. inappropriate antimicrobial therapy may contribute to the increasing emergence of bacterial resistance, as well as to increased health care costs. thus, there is a continuing search for reasonably safe, well-tolerated, and effective antimicrobial agents that are less susceptible to the development of resistance than older agents. objective: the department of veterans affairs (va) medical center in nashville, tennessee, was i site in a multicenter, phase iii, randomized, investigator-blinded clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of clinafloxacin with those of piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of adult  patients with ssti. methods: over an 18-month period, patients aged > or = 18 years with physical findings of acute bacterial ssti requiring hospitalization and intravenous antimicrobial therapy were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either clinafloxacin 200 mg iv every 12 hours or piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g  iv every 6 hours. after a minimum of 3 days of intravenous therapy, a switch to oral therapy with clinafloxacin 200 mg po every 12 hours or amoxicillin/clavulanate 500 mg po every 8 hours could be made in the respective treatment groups. results: the center enrolled 84 patients (42 in each group), all but i of whom were male, reflecting the typical va medical center population. the mean age was 60 years (range, 36-80 years) in the clinafloxacin group and 65  years (range, 35-87) in the piperacillin/tazobactam group; the latter group was significantly older (p = 0.0482), which could have affected recovery rates. sixty-six patients were white and 18 were black. the mean ( +/- sd) duration of treatment was 10.69 +/- 5.34 days in the clinafloxacin group and 12.07 +/- 5.06 days in the piperacillin/tazobactam group; the mean length of stay was 10.83 +/-  10.28 days and 14.95 +/- 19.20 days, respectively. fifty-three (63%) patients were switched to oral therapy (21 in the clinafloxacin group, 32 in the piperacillin/tazobactam group). the most commonly isolated pathogens were staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae. clinical cure rates and microbiologic eradication rates were similar between the 2 treatments. the piperacillin/ tazobactam arm experienced more all-cause adverse events than the clinafloxacin arm, although the difference was not statistically significant. the clinafloxacin arm experienced significantly more adverse events (eg, photosensitivity) that were judged by the investigator to be drug related (p = 0.034). conclusions: in this study population of hospitalized adults, clinafloxacin was as effective as piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of complicated sstis. appropriate precautions must be taken against exposure to sunlight and ultraviolet light in patients receiving clinafloxacin, and adequate monitoring is necessary. further investigation is necessary into how the phototoxic effects of the flu oroquinolones can be limited.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1998  and march 1999].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from april 1998 to march 1999). the number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. a total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. on the whole, among gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from  postoperative infections. among gram-positive anaerobes, peptostreptococcus spp.  and streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. among gram-negative aerobes,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. among gram-negative anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of gram-positive and gram-negative  anaerobes have gradually declined. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. the percentage of mrsa among s. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. the susceptibilities of b. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. among other bacteria in b. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. e. coli and k. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. we found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

AB  == the complete 50,237-bp dna sequence of the conjugative and mobilizing multiresistance plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis re25 was determined. the plasmid had 58 putative open reading frames, 5 of which encode resistance to 12 antimicrobials. chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and the 23s rna methylase are identical to gene products of the broad-host-range plasmid pip501 from streptococcus agalactiae. in addition, a 30.5-kb segment is almost identical to pip501. genes encoding an aminoglycoside 6-adenylyltransferase, a streptothricin  acetyltransferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase are arranged in tandem on a 7.4-kb fragment as previously reported in tn5405 from staphylococcus  aureus and in pjh1 from e. faecalis. one interrupted and five complete is elements as well as three replication genes were also identified. pre25 was transferred by conjugation to e. faecalis, listeria innocua, and lactococcus lactis by means of a transfer region that appears similar to that of pip501. it is concluded that pre25 may contribute to the further spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms via food into the human community.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid against gram-positive uropathogens of hospitalized patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of linezolid, a recently developed antibiotic agent active against gram-positive bacteria, was tested against pathogens from three different collections. (1) uropathogens from hospitalized urological patients (1990/1991) with complicated and/or hospital-acquired utis; urologic clinic, hospital st. elisabeth, straubing. (2) uropathogens from a multi-centre study (1995/1996) comprising 37 urological centres throughout germany. (3) mrsa isolates of patients and staff (1999/2000) within the hospital st. elisabeth, straubing. genotyping of the latter isolates was performed by pulsed-field-electrophoresis. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of linezolid determined by an agar (isosensitest) dilution method using a multipoint inoculator and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu per point ranged for methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (n=27) between 2 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant s. aureus (mrsa) (n=35) between 1 and 2 mg/l, for methicillin susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (msse) (n=67) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant cns (mrse) (n=19) between 0.25  and 2 mg/l, for enterococcus. faecalis (n=184) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for e. faecium (n=3) 2 mg/l and for streptococcus spp. (n=4) between 0.25 and 1 mg/l, indicating that all strains were susceptible. according to the in vitro activity, linezolid may be considered a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of  complicated uti caused by gram-positive uropathogens. thus, linezolid should be evaluated in a clinical study.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  == isolates from urine samples obtained during 1999 were identified and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents studied along with any production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) by escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. a total of 13774 samples were analysed using an automatic system for  the detection of bacterial atp (coral, usa). of these samples, 49% were reported  to be positive and uncontaminated; bacteria most frequently isolated were e. coli (47%), proteus mirabilis (7%), enterococcus faecalis (6%) and k. pneumoniae (5%). the susceptibility studies showed 37% e. coli strains resistant to amoxycillin+clavulanate 33% to cotrimoxazole and 22% to ciprofloxacin. seven strains of e. coli produced esbl. thirteen per cent of strains were resistant to  cefuroxime but only (1%) to fosfomycin. resistance to nitrofurantoin in k. pneumoniae was 38%. p. mirabilis showed 52% resistance to cotrimoxazole and 13% staphylococcus aureus, were methicillin-resistant. e. faecalis did not show any special resistance to normal medication. fosfomycin continued to show high activity against gram-negative bacilli. however, enterococci, some species of staphylococci and yeasts were difficult to treat empirically. esbl were detected  in the isolates of e. coli and there were some methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

TI  == the enterococcal surface protein, esp, is involved in enterococcus faecalis biofilm formation.
AB  == the enterococcal surface protein, esp, is a high-molecular-weight surface protein of unknown function whose frequency is significantly increased among infection-derived enterococcus faecalis isolates. in this work, a global structural similarity was found between bap, a biofilm-associated protein of staphylococcus aureus, and esp. analysis of the relationship between the presence of the esp-encoding gene (esp) and the biofilm formation capacity in e. faecalis  demonstrated that the presence of the esp gene is highly associated (p < 0.0001)  with the capacity of e. faecalis to form a biofilm on a polystyrene surface, since 93.5% of the e. faecalis esp-positive isolates were capable of forming a biofilm. moreover, none of the e. faecalis esp-deficient isolates were biofilm producers. depending on the e. faecalis isolate, insertional mutagenesis of esp caused either a complete loss of the biofilm formation phenotype or no apparent phenotypic defect. complementation studies revealed that esp expression in an e.  faecalis esp-deficient strain promoted primary attachment and biofilm formation on polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride plastic from urine collection bags. together, these results demonstrate that (i) biofilm formation capacity is widespread among clinical e. faecalis isolates, (ii) the biofilm formation capacity is restricted to the e. faecalis strains harboring esp, and (iii) esp promotes primary attachment and biofilm formation of e. faecalis on abiotic surfaces.

TI  == a simple model host for identifying gram-positive virulence factors.
AB  == we demonstrate the use of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans as a facile and inexpensive model host for several gram-positive human bacterial pathogens. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus, but not bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecium, or streptococcus pyogenes, kill adult c. elegans. focusing our studies on the enterococcal species, we found that both e. faecalis and e. faecium kill c. elegans eggs and hatchlings, although only e. faecalis kills the adults. in the case of adults, a low inoculum of e. faecalis grows to a high titer in the c. elegans intestine, resulting in a persistent infection that cannot be eradicated by prolonged feeding on e. faecium. interestingly, a high titer of e. faecium also accumulates in the nematode gut, but does not affect the longevity of the worms. two e. faecalis virulence-related factors that play an important role in mammalian models of infection, fsr, a putative quorum-sensing system, and cytolysin, are also important for nematode killing. we exploit the apparent parallels between gram-positive infection in simple and more complex organisms by using the nematode to identify an e. faecalis virulence factor, scrb, which is relevant to  mammalian pathogenesis.

AB  == pathogenic enterococci are becoming resistant to currently available antibiotics, including vancomycin, the drug of last resort for gram-positive infections. enterococci pose a significant public health threat, not least because of the risk of transferring vancomycin resistance to the ubiquitous staphylococcus aureus. vancomycin resistance is manifested by cell wall peptidoglycan precursors with altered termini that cannot bind the antibiotic. small molecules with well-oriented nucleophile-electrophile assembly and complementary chirality to the peptidoglycan termini were identified as catalytic and selective cleavers of  the peptidoglycan precursor depsipeptide. these molecules were tested in combination with vancomycin and were found to re-sensitize vancomycin-resistant bacteria to the antibiotic.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == etiologies of the urinary tract infections in a yemeni city.
AB  == objective: to determine the causative agents of urinary tract infection in yemeni patients in sana'a city, and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities of these agents in vitro. methods: consecutive mid-stream urine specimens were submitted to our laboratory by 4029 patients in sana'a city from 1990 to the end  of 1999. the specimens were cultured and the isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques. the antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were also determined (in vitro). results: the number of patients with urinary tract infection who yielded positive cultures from their mid stream urine specimens was 685 out of 4029 patients (17%). the ratio of female-to-male patients was 462:223 (2.07:1). the causative agents were mainly members of the family enterobacteriaceae, 579 out of the 685 isolates (84.5%). escherichia coli  was the main pathogen, 357 isolates out of all the isolates (52%) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, 143 isolates (21%) and proteus species, 56 isolates (8%).  the other pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter  aerogenes, staphylococcus saprophyticus, corynebacterium urealyticum and enterococcus faecalis) constituted 129 out of the 685 isolates (19%). there was a shift in the types of the causative agents of urinary tract infection between the first and 2nd halves of the study period. the isolation of escherichia coli decreased from 60% in the first half to 42% in the 2nd. whereas klebsiella pneumoniae increased from 16% in the first half to 27% in the 2nd, proteus species from 8% to 9%, staphylococcus aureus from 5% to 7%, pseudomonas aeruginosa from 3% to 7%, enterobacter aerogenes from 3% to 3.5%, staphylococcus  saprophyticus from 2% to 3% and corynebacterium urealyticum from 1% to 2%. ninety percent of all the urinary pathogens were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, 75% to nitrofurantoin, 57% to gentamicin, 46% to cefaclor, 46% to nalidixic acid, 39% to doxycycline, 37% to co-trimoxazole and 20% to ampiclox. conclusion: the types of  urinary tract pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibilities in addition to the  rate of isolation from male and female patients are reported. it is recommended that ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin or both are used in the blind treatment of  urinary tract infection while awaiting the culture and sensitivity results. it is also recommended to continuously monitor the pattern of urinary pathogens from the community to guide the blind treatment of patients in the future.

AB  == the primary bactericidal classes used therapeutically as single agents, are the quinolones and the cell-wall active agents. in this study, their rates of killing were compared. the des-fluoro(6) quinolone bms-284756 (t-3811me), fluoroquinolones (trovafloxacin, levofloxacin) and cell wall-active agents (beta-lactams, vancomycin) were evaluated against enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis. time-kill analysis was done at 10x the mic, using mueller-hinton broth (supplemented with 7% lysed horse blood for streptococcus pneumoniae and the viridans streptococci), or brain heart infusion broth for beta-haemolytic streptococci. using a 3-log(10) decrease in viable count as an index of bactericidal activity, bms-284756 and the fluoroquinolones killed enterobacteriaceae rapidly, requiring < 2 h versus > or =6 h for beta-lactams. the staphylococcal cell counts generally decreased more rapidly with quinolone exposure, compared with those treated with vancomycin or the beta-lactams. the antimicrobial agents killed streptococci and enterococci more slowly, requiring > 6 h to decrease the viable count by 99.9%. in summary, bms-284756 killing rates are similar to those of recent fluoroquinolones and are  bacterial group-dependent. overall, the quinolones are more rapidly bactericidal  than vancomycin and the beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == antibacterial activity of marula (sclerocarya birrea (a. rich.) hochst. subsp. caffra (sond.) kokwaro) (anacardiaceae) bark and leaves.
AB  == marula bark is widely used for bacteria-related diseases by indigenous cultures in africa. this study was undertaken to investigate whether the ethnobotanical use can be validated by laboratory studies. bark and leaves were extracted with acetone and mic values were determined using a microplate serial dilution technique with staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis as test organisms. all extracts were active with mic values from 0.15 to 3 mg/ml. based on minimum inhibitory concentration values, inner bark extracts tended to be the most potent followed by outer bark and leaf  extracts, but the differences were not statistically significant. there were two  major bioactive components visible after bioautography of leaf extracts: one strongly polar and the other highly non-polar. the bioactive components could be  separated from 92% of the non-active dry matter by solvent-solvent fractionation  into the carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and n-butanol fractions; these fractions, however, still contained many different compounds. using bark may be detrimental to the plant, but leaf material can also be used for antibacterial application.

AB  == this study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their mics and mbcs in accordance with nccls susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. a total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, providencia rettgeri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. all e. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. k. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. methicillin-resistant s. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. s. epidermidis strains were  susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. incubation of s. aureus and e. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was  statistically significant at 0.25 x mic with respect to controls (p < 0.05). inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the  presence of 0.25 x mic of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x mic. these findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.

TI  == characterization of selected strains of pneumococcal surface protein a.
AB  == several proteins, in addition to the polysaccharide capsule, have recently been implicated in the full virulence of the streptococcus pneumoniae bacterial pathogen. one of these novel virulence factors of s. pneumoniae is pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa). the n-terminal, cell surface exposed, and functional part of pspa is essential for full pneumococcal virulence, as evidenced by the fact that antibodies raised against this part of the protein are protective against pneumococcal infections. pspa has recently been implicated in anti-complementary function as it reduces complement-mediated clearance and phagocytosis of pneumococci. several recombinant n-terminal fragments of pspa from different strains of pneumococci, rx1, bg9739, bg6380, ef3296, and ef5668, were analyzed using circular dichroism, analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity and equilibrium methods, and sequence homology. uniformly, all strains of pspa molecules studied have a high alpha-helical secondary structure content and they adopt predominantly a coiled-coil structure with an elongated, likely rod-like shape. no beta-sheet structures were detected for any  of the pspa molecules analyzed. all pspas were found to be monomeric in solution  with the exception of the bg9739 strain which had the propensity to partially aggregate but only into a tetrameric form. these structural properties were correlated with the functional, anti-complementary properties of pspa molecules based on the polar distribution of highly charged termini of its coiled-coil domain. the recombinant rx1 pspa is currently under consideration for pneumococcal vaccine development.

TI  == a new hydrogen peroxide--based medical-device detergent with germicidal properties: comparison with enzymatic cleaners.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the cleaning and bacterial killing ability of a new non-enzyme-based formulation (killing detergent solution [kds]) compared with commercially available enzymatic detergents that included metrizyme (metrex research division of sybron canada ltd. morrisburg, ontario) and gzyme (germiphene corp, brantford, ontario). kds is a hydrogen peroxide-based detergent formulation that combines cleaning efficacy with the ability to kill microorganisms. the kds formulation helps ensure the protection of the health care worker from infectious risk during the soaking and  cleaning stages of medical device reprocessing and reduces the bioburden on devices before sterilization/disinfection. methods: test organisms that included  enterococcus faecalis, salmonella choleraesuis, staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were suspended in artificial test soil (ats-b; patent submitted), inoculated at 10(6) colonyforming units per carrier and dried overnight before detergent exposure. the ats-b mimics the blood, protein, carbohydrate, and endotoxin levels of patient-used medical devices. plastic lumen carriers and a flexible colonoscope were used for surface and simulated-use testing, respectively. results: the results for the microbial challenge dried onto polyvinyl chloride (pvc) carriers demonstrated that the ability of kds to remove protein, blood, carbohydrate, and endotoxin from surface test carriers was as effective as the enzyme detergents that were evaluated. furthermore, kds was able to effect approximately a 5-log(10) reduction in microbial loads with a 3-minute exposure at room temperature, whereas none of the other detergents were  as effective. in simulated-use testing of a soiled colonoscope, kds was significantly better at ensuring microbial killing compared with gzyme and metrizyme and was equivalent to the enzymatic detergents in cleaning ability. conclusions: in summary the kds has excellent microbial-killing ability in 3-minute exposures at room temperature and cleans as well as the existing enzymatic detergent formulations that were tested.

TI  == resistance studies with daptomycin.
AB  == we studied the in vitro emergence of resistance to daptomycin using three methods: spontaneous resistance incidence, serial passage in the presence of increasing drug concentrations, and chemical mutagenesis. no spontaneously resistant mutants were obtained for any organism tested (<10(-10) for staphylococcus aureus, <10(-9) for staphylococcus epidermidis, <10(-9) for enterococcus faecalis, <10(-9) for enterococcus faecium, <10(-8) for streptococcus pneumoniae). population analysis demonstrated that bacterial susceptibility to daptomycin is heterogeneous. assay results were sensitive to calcium concentration and culture density, both of which can affect apparent resistance rates. stable s. aureus mutants were isolated by both serial passage in liquid media and chemical mutagenesis. the daptomycin mics for these isolates  were 8- to 32-fold higher than for the parental strain. many mutants with high mics (>12.5 microg/ml) had significant growth defects but did not display phenotypes typical of s. aureus small colony variants. the voltage component (delta psi) of the bacterial membrane potential was increased in three independent resistant isolates. in vivo data showed that some daptomycin-resistant mutants had lost significant virulence. for other mutants, the degree of in vitro resistance was greater than the change in in vivo susceptibility. these results suggest that infection with some daptomycin-resistant organisms may still be easily treatable.

TI  == complement evasion by borrelia burgdorferi: serum-resistant strains promote c3b inactivation.
AB  == the most characteristic features of the lyme disease pathogens, the borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) group, are their ability to invade tissues and to circumvent the immune defenses of the host for extended periods of time, despite  elevated levels of borrelia-specific antibodies in serum and other body fluids. our aim in the present study was to determine whether b. burgdorferi is able to interfere with complement (c) at the level of c3 by accelerating c3b inactivation and thus to inhibit the amplification of the c cascade. strains belonging to different genospecies (borrelia garinii, b. burgdorferi sensu stricto, and borrelia afzelii) were compared for their sensitivities to normal human serum and abilities to promote factor i-mediated c3b degradation. b. burgdorferi sensu stricto and b. afzelii strains were found to be serum resistant. when the spirochetes were incubated with radiolabeled c3b, factor i-mediated degradation of c3b was observed in the presence of c-resistant b. afzelii (n = 3) and b. burgdorferi sensu stricto (n = 1) strains but not in the presence of c-sensitive  b. garinii (n = 7) strains or control bacteria (escherichia coli, staphylococcus  aureus, and enterococcus faecalis). immunoblotting and radioligand binding analyses showed that the c-resistant strains had the capacity to acquire the c inhibitors factor h and factor h-like protein 1 (fhl-1) from growth medium and human serum. a novel surface protein with an apparent molecular mass of 35 kda was found to preferentially bind to the n terminus region of factor h. thus, the  serum-resistant b. burgdorferi s.l. strains can circumvent c attack by binding the c inhibitors factor h and fhl-1 to their surfaces and promoting factor i-mediated c3b degradation.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus resistance to human defensins and evasion of neutrophil killing via the novel virulence factor mprf is based on modification of membrane  lipids with l-lysine.
AB  == defensins, antimicrobial peptides of the innate immune system, protect human mucosal epithelia and skin against microbial infections and are produced in large amounts by neutrophils. the bacterial pathogen staphylococcus aureus is insensitive to defensins by virtue of an unknown resistance mechanism. we describe a novel staphylococcal gene, mprf, which determines resistance to several host defense peptides such as defensins and protegrins. an mprf mutant strain was killed considerably faster by human neutrophils and exhibited attenuated virulence in mice, indicating a key role for defensin resistance in the pathogenicity of s. aureus. analysis of membrane lipids demonstrated that the mprf mutant no longer modifies phosphatidylglycerol with l-lysine. as this unusual modification leads to a reduced negative charge of the membrane surface,  mprf-mediated peptide resistance is most likely based on repulsion of the cationic peptides. accordingly, inactivation of mprf led to increased binding of  antimicrobial peptides by the bacteria. mprf has no similarity with genes of known function, but related genes were identified in the genomes of several pathogens including mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis. mprf thus constitutes a novel virulence factor, which may  be of general relevance for bacterial pathogens and represents a new target for attacking multidrug resistant bacteria.

TI  == linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  == linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments,  including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis  or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as  effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.

TI  == production, purification and some properties of bac201, a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance produced by staphylococcus aureus ab201.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus ab201, a clinical isolate from wound pus, produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance termed as bac201, that was inhibitory to streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, neisseria meningitidis and a number of staphylococcal species. it was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration (biosil-sec-125), and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (vydac c4). the native  bac201 was sized at approximately 170-kda as determined by gf hplc. fraction-i (native bac201), having antibacterial activity was also examined by transmission  electron microscopy and appeared as globular structure showing resemblance with phage-like objects. the purification of bac201 resulted in 466-fold increase in specific activity and recovery of 0.94% of total antibacterial activity. the purified bac201 migrated as single band on sds-page with an estimated molecular mass of about 41-kda. bac201 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, resistant to heat and organic solvents, and active over a wide range of ph (2.5-10). the amino acid composition revealed a general resemblance with other reported high molecular mass bacteriocins and predominance of glycine (39%), proline (13%) and  alanine (8%) residues. further results showed that bac201 has a bactericidal effect on sensitive cells which is not produced by either cell lysis or apparent  loss of membrane permeability.

TI  == aggregation substance-mediated adherence of enterococcus faecalis to immobilized  extracellular matrix proteins.
AB  == aggregation substance (as) of enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), a sex pheromone plasmid encoded cell surface protein, mediates the formation of bacterial aggregates, thereby promoting plasmid transfer. the influence of pad1-encoded as, asa1, on binding to immobilized extracellular matrix proteins was studied. the presence of as increased enterococcal adherence to fibronectin more than eight-fold, to thrombospondin more than four-fold, to vitronectin more  than three-fold, and to collagen type i more than two-fold (p<0.001). in contrast, binding to laminin and collagen type iv occurred independently of as. adherence of the constitutively as expressing e. faecalis og1x(pam721) to immobilized fibronectin was found to be approximately five times higher than that of staphylococcus aureus cowan and approximately 30 times higher than that of streptococcus bovis. investigation of strains with various deletions within the structural gene of asa1 suggests that attachment to immobilized fibronectin is mainly mediated by amino acids within the variable region or by neighbouring residues. thus, as may promote adherence to injured epithelium and endothelium, where extracellular matrix proteins are exposed, thereby facilitating colonization and infection.

TI  == improvement of water-soluble cephalosporin derivatives having antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == we evaluated a series of novel cephem antibiotics, n-alkylpyridinium (alkyl group), n-carboxyethylpyridinium (carboxylic group), n-sulfoethylpyridinium (sulfonic group) and n-alkylquaternary ammonium salts (ammonioethyl group), n-alkyl-aromatic-quaternary ammonium salts and n-alkyl-heterocyclic quaternary ammonium salts (cyclic group) as vinylthio pyridinium derivatives at the c-3 position and hydroxyiminoaminothiazol at the c-7 position, for their activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and their solubility,  by measuring the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and the dissolving test in phosphate buffer. all tested compounds, except for the alkyl group, showed good solubility (>10%) in 1/15 m phosphate buffer (ph 7.2). the concentrations required to inhibit 80% of the bacterial strains (mic80s) of the alkyl group, carboxylic group, sulfonic group, ammonioethyl group and cyclic group against mrsa were 1.56, 12.5-25, 6.25, 1.56 and 1.56 microg/ml, respectively. these results indicated that the ammonioethyl and cyclic groups yield the maximum anti-mrsa and anti-enterococcus faecalis activity, and also good water solubility.

TI  == in vitro activities of rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32  times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than  methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428  had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.

TI  == a novel heterodimeric antimicrobial peptide from the tree-frog phyllomedusa distincta.
AB  == we present here the purification and the analysis of the structural and functional properties of distinctin, a 5.4 kda heterodimeric peptide with antimicrobial activity from the tree-frog phyllomedusa distincta. this peptide was isolated from the crude extract of skin granular glands by different chromatographic steps. its minimal inhibitory concentration was determined against pathogenic escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometric  investigations demonstrated that distinctin is constituted of two different polypeptide chains connected by an intermolecular disulphide bridge. circular dichroism and fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy studies showed that this  molecule adopts, in water, a structure containing a significant percentage of anti-parallel beta-sheet. a conformational variation was observed under experimental conditions mimicking a membrane-like environment. database searches  did not show sequence similarities with any known antimicrobial peptides. in the  light of these results, we can consider distinctin as the first example of a new  class of antimicrobial heterodimeric peptides from frog skin.

TI  == oral fluoroquinolone therapy results in drug adsorption on ureteral stents and prevention of biofilm formation.
AB  == the oral administration of ciprofloxacin (250mg bid) and ofloxacin (300mg bid) in 40 patients with ureteral stents, led to drug levels on all the device surfaces that were higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of escherichia coli (0.004--0.015 mg/l), the most common uropathogen. the drug levels in the film were higher than the mic of other common pathogens, namely pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.25--1.0 mg/l), enterococcus faecalis (0.25--2.0 mg/l) and staphylococcus aureus (0.12--0.5 mg/l) in a few cases (six, three and 14 cases out of 40, respectively). for both antibiotics, the concentrations were greater than the mic of many uropathogens on the film surrounding the devices (0.89 vs 0.31 mg/l respectively, p=0.05), and on the devices themselves (0.22 vs. 0.12 mg/l, p=0.207). adsorption of the antibiotics was higher to the film than to the  stent (p<0.0001). ciprofloxacin concentration on the film surrounding the stents  was significantly higher than that of ofloxacin (p=0.05), while there was no statistical concentration difference between the two antibiotics adsorbed onto the actual devices (p=0.207). no bacteria were found in patients' urine and no biofilms were detected. this is the first report of an oral antibiotic being adsorbed onto medical devices. it potentially provides a new approach of preventing infection, and avoids the need to pre-coat devices with agents whose use will be restricted once bacteria develop resistance to them. if biomaterial properties can be enhanced to increase further the adsorptive concentration of drug, the risk of infections and recalcitrant biofilm formation could be significantly reduced in a highly susceptible patient population.

TI  == chlorination of pure bacterial cultures in aqueous solution.
AB  == the fate and distribution of chlorine in aqueous solutions containing four pure bacterial cultures was studied. solutions were subjected to chlorination at different initial free chlorine concentrations. resulting concentrations of residual chlorine were determined by both dpd/fas titration and membrane introduction mass spectrometry (mims). in all cases, false-positive breakpoint chlorination curves, probably attributable to the formation of chloroorganic-n compounds, were observed by dpd/fas titration, while little or no inorganic residual chloramine was found by mims. free chlorine was observed in similar quantities by both methods after chlorine demand by bacterial cellular materials  in solution was satisfied. these results indicated the residual chloramines existed in the form of organic chloramines; these compounds are generally recognized as being poor antimicrobial agents. further investigation confirmed that the bacterial cells were the source of organic-n compounds. the kinetics of  chlorination of pure bacterial suspensions was also studied. the pattern of residual chlorine decay following chlorination of the bacterial suspensions indicated rapid initial free chlorine consumption, followed by slow free chlorine consumption, with trace quantities of inorganic chloramine being formed.

TI  == determination of the antibacterial efficacy of several antiseptics tested on skin by an 'ex-vivo' test.
AB  == there are many skin antiseptics commercially available. although their antibacterial activity has often been well studied, their potential effectiveness on skin remains poorly documented. to date, in-vivo protocols designed for the testing of the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics cannot use, for ethical reasons, pathogenic bacteria or new formulations whose toxicity in human subjects is unknown. an 'ex-vivo' test was recently developed to overcome these problems.  freshly excised human skin from abdominal or breast reduction was placed in a diffusion cell containing a maintenance medium in the recipient compartment. a bacterial inoculum was then applied to the stratum corneum and, after a drying step, antiseptic formulations were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. several micro-organisms were investigated: - staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant ent. faecium (vre), s. epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli--with several biocides--para-chloro-meta-xylenol (pcmx, active compound of dettol), povidone iodine, triclosan (in isopropanol) and chlorhexidine. results from the ex-vivo test were compared with results obtained  in suspension and glass-carrier tests. the bactericidal activity of the biocides  depended upon the test performed and results were generally significantly different from one method to the other. all biocides tested in the suspension test achieved >4 log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentrations, apart from povidone iodine tested against ent. faecalis and vre. the antibacterial activity  of biocides tested in the glass-carrier test was significantly lower than in the  suspension test, with the exception of triclosan in isopropanol, which was as effective in both suspension and glass-carrier test. in the ex-vivo test, triclosan in isopropanol achieved a log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentration of 1.105-1.771 (with the exception of p. aeruginosa with 0.758 log10 reduction). pcmx, povidone iodine and chlorhexidine achieved log10 reductions in viable bacterial concentration of 0.303-0.901. chlorhexidine tested against p. aeruginosa produced a 1.94 log10 reduction in concentration. these results confirm previous observations about the need for testing the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics on skin surface to determine their in-situ  efficacy and encourage further the use of the ex-vivo protocol.

AB  == two series of experiments are reported which result in the discrimination between helicobacter pylori and other bacterial gastroesophageal isolates using a newly developed odour generating system, an electronic nose and a hybrid intelligent odour recognition system. in the first series of experiments, after 5 h of growth (37 degrees c), 53 volatile 'sniffs' were collected over the headspace of complex broth cultures of the following clinical isolates: staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella sp., h. pylori, enterococcus faecalis (10(7) ml(-1)), mixed infection  (proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and e. faecalis 3 x 10(6) ml each) and sterile cultures. fifty-six normalised variables were extracted from 14 conductive polymer sensor responses and analysed by a 3-layer back propagation neural network (nn). the nn prediction rate achieved was 98% and the test data (37.7% of all data) was recognised correctly. successful clustering of bacterial  classes was also achieved by discriminant analysis (da) of a normalised subset of sensor data. cross-validation identified correctly seven 'unknown' samples. in the second series of experiments after 150 min of microaerobic growth at 37 degrees c, 24 volatile samples were collected over the headspace of h. pylori cultures in enriched (hpp) and normal (hp) media and 11 samples over sterile (n)  cultures. forty-eight sensor parameters were extracted from 12 sensor responses and analysed by a 3-layer nn previously optimised by a genetic algorithm (ga). ga-nn analysis achieved a 94% prediction rate of 'unknown' data. additionally the 'genetically' selected 16 input neurones were used to perform da-cross validation that showed a clear clustering of three groups and reclassified correctly nine 'sniffs'. it is concluded that the most important factors that govern the performance of an intelligent bacterial odour detection system are: (a) an odour  generation mechanism, (b) a rapid odour delivery system similar to the mammalian  olfactory system, (c) a gas sensor array of high reproducibility and (d) a hybrid intelligent model (expert system) which will enable the parallel use of ga-nns and multivariate techniques.

AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial action of mineral trioxide aggregate (mta), portland cement, calcium hydroxide paste (chp), sealapex and dycal. the chemical elements of mta and two portland cements were also analyzed. four standard bacterial strains: staphylococcus aureus (atcc 6538), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), bacillus subtilis (atcc 6633), one wild fungus, candida albicans (icb/usp-562), and one mixture of these were used. thirty petri plates with 20 ml of bhi agar were inoculated with 0.1 ml of the experimental suspensions. three cavities, each one measuring 4 mm in depth and 4 mm in diameter, were made in each agar plate using a copper coil and then completely filled with the product to be tested. the plates were pre-incubated for 1 h at environmental temperature followed by incubation at 37 degrees c for 48 h. the diameters of the zones of microbial inhibition were then measured. samples from diffusion and inhibition halos were extracted from each plate and immersed in 7 ml bhi broth and incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 h. analyses of chemical elements present in mta and in two samples of portland cement were performed with a fluorescence spectrometer rx. the results showed that the antimicrobial activity of chp was superior to those of mta, portland cement, sealapex and dycal, for all microorganisms tested, presenting inhibition zones of 6-9.5 mm and diffusion zones of 10-18 mm. mta, portland cement, and sealapex presented only diffusion zones and among these, sealapex produced the largest zone. dycal did not show inhibition or diffusion zones. portland cements contain the same chemical elements as mta except that mta also contains bismuth.

TI  == antibiotic activity and characterization of bb-3497, a novel peptide deformylase  inhibitor.
AB  == peptide deformylase (pdf) is an essential bacterial metalloenzyme which deformylates the n-formylmethionine of newly synthesized polypeptides and as such represents a novel target for antibacterial chemotherapy. to identify novel pdf inhibitors, we screened a metalloenzyme inhibitor library and identified an n-formyl-hydroxylamine derivative, bb-3497, and a related natural hydroxamic acid antibiotic, actinonin, as potent and selective inhibitors of pdf. to elucidate the interactions that contribute to the binding affinity of these inhibitors, we  determined the crystal structures of bb-3497 and actinonin bound to escherichia coli pdf at resolutions of 2.1 and 1.75 a, respectively. in both complexes, the active-site metal atom was pentacoordinated by the side chains of cys 90, his 132, and his 136 and the two oxygen atoms of n-formyl-hydroxylamine or hydroxamate. bb-3497 had activity against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, and activity against some gram-negative bacteria. time-kill analysis showed that the mode of action of bb-3497 was primarily bacteriostatic. the mechanism of resistance was via mutations within the formyltransferase gene, as previously described for actinonin. while actinonin and its derivatives have not  been used clinically because of their poor pharmacokinetic properties, bb-3497 was shown to be orally bioavailable. a single oral dose of bb-3497 given 1 h after intraperitoneal injection of s. aureus smith or methicillin-resistant s. aureus protected mice from infection with median effective doses of 8 and 14 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. these data validate pdf as a novel target for the design of a new generation of antibacterial agents.

AB  == patients (n = 409) with severe skin and soft tissue infections (sstis) were randomized to receive clinafloxacin or piperacillin-tazobactam (plus optional vancomycin for methicillin-resistant cocci), administered intravenously, with the option to switch to oral medication. most patients had cellulitis, wound infections, or diabetic foot infections. staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common baseline pathogens. fewer baseline pathogens were resistant to clinafloxacin (1.8%) than to piperacillin-tazobactam (6.2%) (p = 0.001). the clinafloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam groups did not differ significantly in clinical cure rates (68.8 and 65.2%, respectively) or microbiologic eradication rates (61.5 and 57.2%). clinafloxacin yielded higher eradication rates for all three of the most  common pathogenic species, although no differences were statistically significant. within the power of this study, the overall frequency of adverse events was similar (p = 0.577) in the two treatment groups. drug-associated adverse events (p = 0.050) and treatment discontinuations (p = 0.052) were marginally more frequent in the clinafloxacin group, primarily due to phototoxicity in outpatients receiving clinafloxacin. although most cases of phototoxicity were mild to moderate, four cases were reported as severe. in summary, clinafloxacin monotherapy was equivalent in effectiveness to therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam plus optional vancomycin in the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe sstis.

AB  == the ability of insulin to affect the growth kinetics of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was measured. for all organisms, insulin, in the absence of a metabolizable sugar source, i.e., glucose or starch in mueller-hinton medium, had no effect on generation time as compared with a homologous control. response to insulin, in the form of increased or decreased generation times, for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, was dependent on the concentration of insulin, the concentration of glucose present, and the initial concentration of bacteria exposed to the glucose and insulin.

TI  == [surveillance of gram positive cocci susceptibility to betalactams, glycopeptides, and other antimicrobials].
AB  == background: during the last decade, there has been a progressive increase in the  resistance of gram (+) cocci to betalactamics and other antimicrobials. therefore, vancomycin and teicoplanin have incorporated as alternative antimicrobial drugs. aim: to assess the susceptibility of gram (+) cocci to different antimicrobials including vancomycin and teicoplanin. material and methods: we studied 447 strains of gram (+) cocci coming from ambulatory and hospitalized patients. these included 308 enterococcus sp strains, 99 staphylococcus aureus strains and 40 coagulase negative staphylococci strains. enterococci susceptibility was measured using minimal inhibitory concentrations in agar and that of staphylococci, through diffusion. susceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin was measured using minimal inhibitory concentrations in all strains. results: enterococcus faecalis was 100% susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, vancomycin and teicoplanin, 23% susceptible to tetracyclin and 47% to chloramphenicol. susceptibility of e faecium was 61% to penicillin, 49% to chloramphenicol, 41% to tetracyclin, 100% to vancomycin and teicoplanin. of 19 enterococcus spp strains, 90% were susceptible to ampicillin,  80% to penicillin, 55% to chloramphenicol and 45% to tetracyclin. only one e casseiflavus strain had a low level resistance to vancomycin and was susceptible  to teicoplanin. no staphylococcus aureus strain was resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. conclusions: a permanent surveillance of gram (+) cocci antimicrobial susceptibility is required to update therapeutic schemes.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility to everninomycin of gram-positive nosocomial pathogens isolated from intensive care units in germany.
AB  == background: gram-positive bacteria are increasingly found to be causative pathogens in nosocomial infections, and the occurrence of vancomycin resistance in enterococci as well as staphylococci has prompted the investigation of alternative antimicrobial agents active against these strains. everninomycin, a new oligosaccharide antibiotic, has excellent in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria, including those resistant to vancomycin. however, avilamycin, a related compound, has been used in europe as a growth promoter in animal food for years and concern has been raised that cross-resistance in clinical isolates may arise. methods: we studied a collection of 268 nosocomial gram-positive isolates from intensive care unit patients with nosocomial pneumonia, urinary tract infection and sepsis, using standard in vitro susceptibility testing. results: it could be shown that all species tested were exquisitely sensitive to everninomycin (mic(90) of 0.38 microg/ml for staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 microg/ml for enterococci and 0.75 microg/ml for coagulase-negative staphylococci). furthermore, no difference could be observed between methicillin-resistant and methicillin-sensitive s. aureus or between enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis. conclusions: these results suggest that everninomycin is a promising antibiotic for the treatment of nosocomial infections in intensive care unit patients and that the use of a related substance as an additive in animal food has not yet promoted resistance in clinical isolates.

TI  == use of preclinical data for selection of a phase ii/iii dose for evernimicin and  identification of a preclinical mic breakpoint.
AB  == one of the most challenging issues in the design of phase ii/iii clinical trials  of antimicrobial agents is dose selection. the choice is often based on preclinical data from pharmacokinetic (pk) studies with animals and healthy volunteers but is rarely linked directly to the target organisms except by the mic, an in vitro measure of antimicrobial activity with many limitations. it is the thesis of this paper that rational dose-selection decisions can be made on the basis of the pharmacodynamics (pds) of the test agent predicted by a mathematical model which uses four data sets: (i) the distribution of mics for clinical isolates, (ii) the distribution of the values of the pk parameters for the test drug in the population, (iii) the pd target(s) developed from animal models of infection, and (iv) the protein binding characteristics of the test drug. in performing this study with the new anti-infective agent evernimicin, we  collected a large number (n = 4,543) of recent clinical isolates of gram-positive pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, and staphylococcus aureus) and determined the mics using e-test methods  (ab biodisk, stockholm, sweden) for susceptibility to evernimicin. population pk  data were collected from healthy volunteers (n = 40) and patients with hypoalbuminemia (n = 12), and the data were analyzed by using npem iii. pd targets were developed with a neutropenic murine thigh infection model with three target pathogens: s. pneumoniae (n = 5), e. faecalis (n = 2), and s. aureus (n =  4). drug exposure or the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve/mic (auc/mic) was found to be the best predictor of microbiological efficacy. there were three possible microbiological results: stasis of the initial inoculum at 24 h (10(7) cfu), log killing (pathogen dependent, ranging from 1 to 3 log(10)), or  90% maximal killing effect (90% e(max)). the levels of protein binding in humans  and mice were similar. the pk and pd of 6 and 9 mg of evernimicin per kg of body  weight were compared; the population values for the model parameters and population covariance matrix were used to generate five monte carlo simulations with 200 subjects each. the fractional probability of attaining the three pd targets was calculated for each dose and for each of the three pathogens. all differences in the fractional probability of attaining the target auc/mic in this pd model were significant. for s. pneumoniae, the probability of attaining all three pd targets was high for both doses. for s. aureus and enterococci, there were increasing differences between the 6- and 9-mg/kg evernimicin doses for reaching the 2 log killing (s. aureus), 1 log killing (enterococci), or 90% e(max) auc/mic targets. this same approach may also be used to set preliminary in vitro mic breakpoints.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of meropenem versus other extended-spectrum antimicrobial agents against 2,085 clinical isolates tested in 13 brazilian centers.
AB  == meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibacterial agent with a very broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it is the second agent of its class to become available in brazil. the in vitro antibacterial activity of meropenem was compared with imipenem and four other antimicrobial agents in a multicenter study. this study involved 13 clinical microbiology laboratories, 10 of which came from 8 brazilian states. a total of 2,085 clinical isolates consecutively collected between december 1995 and march 1996 were susceptibility tested using the etest and following the nccls procedures. meropenem inhibited more than 90% of isolates of enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 microg/ml, except for citrobacter sp. (1 microg/ml). generally, meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem against gram-negative organisms and its spectrum of antimicrobial activity was broader than those of all other drugs tested. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem (mic50, 0.38 microg/ml) was approximately 8-fold more active than imipenem (mic 50,3 microg/ml). imipenem was two-to eight-fold more active than meropenem against some gram-positive specees oxacillin, including enterococcus faecalis (mic 50 of 0.75 microg/ml and 2 microg/ml respectively), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic 50 of 0.47 &mul;g/ml and 0.094 microg/ml), oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (mic 50 of 0.064 microg/ml and 0.5mg/ml). against streptococcus sp. meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem (mic 50, 0.016 microg/ml). the results of this study may be used to guide empiric therapy in brazil and indicates that meropenem may have an important role in the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant strains of bacteria.

AB  == lactobacillus reuteri lth2584 exhibits antimicrobial activity that can be attributed neither to bacteriocins nor to the production of reuterin or organic acids. we have purified the active compound, named reutericyclin, to homogeneity  and characterized its antimicrobial activity. reutericyclin exhibited a broad inhibitory spectrum including lactobacillus spp., bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria innocua. it did not affect the growth of gram-negative bacteria; however, the growth of lipopolysaccharide mutant strains of escherichia coli was inhibited. reutericyclin exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, staphylococcus aureus, and b. subtilis and triggered the lysis  of cells of l. sanfranciscensis in a dose-dependent manner. germination of spores of b. subtilis was inhibited, but the spores remained unaffected under conditions that do not permit germination. the fatty acid supply of the growth media had a strong effect on reutericyclin production and its distribution between producer cells and the culture supernatant. reutericyclin was purified from cell extracts  and culture supernatant of l. reuteri lth2584 cultures grown in mmrs by solvent extraction, gel filtration, rp-c(8) chromatography, and anion-exchange chromatography, followed by rechromatography by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. reutericyclin was characterized as a negatively charged, highly hydrophobic molecule with a molecular mass of 349 da. structural characterization (a. holtzel, m. g. ganzle, g. j. nicholson, w. p. hammes, and g. jung, angew. chem. int. ed. 39:2766-2768, 2000) revealed that reutericyclin is a  novel tetramic acid derivative. the inhibitory activity of culture supernatant of l. reuteri lth2584 corresponded to that of purified as well as synthetic reutericyclin.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis conjugative plasmid pam373: complete nucleotide sequence and genetic analyses of sex pheromone response.
AB  == pam373 is a 36.7 kb conjugative plasmid in enterococcus faecalis that encodes a response to a peptide sex pheromone, cam373, secreted by plasmid-free (recipient) strains of enterococci. it was identified over 15 years ago as one of five plasmids in e. faecalis strain rc73 and was of interest because a related pheromone activity could be detected in culture supernatants of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus gordonii. because of increased clinical concern relating to the possibility of mobilizing vancomycin resistance determinants from enterococci, where they are becoming common, into pathogens such as s. aureus, efforts were initiated to characterize pam373 further. the results of a complete  nucleotide sequence determination of pam373, as well as a genetic analysis of key genes related to regulation of the pheromone response, are reported here. with regard to determinants related to conjugation, the plasmid has a structural organization similar to other known pheromone-responsive plasmids such as pad1, pcf10 and ppd1; however, there are several unique features. although there are significant homologues relating to a pheromone-binding surface protein (trac) and a negatively regulating protein (traa), there is an absence of a determinant equivalent to trab of pad1 (reduces endogenous pheromone) and a determinant for surface-exclusion protein. the precursor structure of the inhibitor peptide iam373 was identified, and its determinant (iam373) was found to be about 500 nt  upstream of an apparent transcription terminator t1. tn917-lac insertion analyses provided interesting insights into aspects of control of the pheromone response and showed that, although the traa product is sensitive to pheromone, it appears  to act differently from the traa homologue of pad1.

TI  == in vitro activity of monoclonal and recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antibodies against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  == background: monoclonal (mabkt) and recombinant single-chain (scfvkt) anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced to represent the internal image of a yeast killer toxin (kt) characterized by a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including gram-positive cocci. pathogenic eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as candida albicans, pneumocystis carinii, and a multidrug-resistant strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis, presenting specific, although yet undefined, kt-cell wall receptors (ktr), have proven to be killed in vitro by mabkt and scfvkt. mabkt and scfvkt exert a therapeutic effect in vivo in experimental models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis by mimicking the functional activity of protective antibodies naturally produced in humans against ktr of infecting microorganisms. the swelling tide of concern over increasing bacterial  resistance to antibiotic drugs gives the impetus to develop new therapeutic compounds against microbial threat. thus, the in vitro bactericidal activity of mabkt and scfvkt against gram-positive, drug-resistant cocci of major epidemiological interest was investigated. materials and methods: mabkt and scfvkt generated by hybridoma and dna recombinant technology from the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with a kt-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mab kt4) were used in a conventional colony forming unit (cfu) assay to determine, from a qualitative point of view, their bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus, s. haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae strains. these bacterial strains are characterized by different patterns of resistance to antibiotics, including methicillin, vancomycin, and penicillin. results: according to the experimental conditions adopted, no bacterial isolate proved to be resistant to the activity of mabkt and scfvkt. conclusions: scfvkt exerted a microbicidal activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, which may represent the basis for the drug modeling of new antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra to tackle the emergence of microbial resistance.

TI  == monoclonal antibodies to cna, a collagen-binding microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules, detach staphylococcus aureus from a collagen substrate.
AB  == previous studies showed that staphylococcus aureus expresses a collagen-binding mscramm (microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules), cna, that is necessary and sufficient for s. aureus cells to adhere to cartilage and is a virulence factor in experimental septic arthritis. we have now used a monoclonal antibody (mab) approach to further analyze the structure and function  of cna. 22 mabs raised against the minimal ligand binding domain, cna-(151-318),  were shown to bind to the mscramm with similar affinity. all mabs appear to recognize conformation-dependent epitopes that were mapped throughout the cna-(151-318) domain using a chimeric strategy where segments of cna are grafted  on ace, a structurally related mscramm from enterococcus faecalis. these mabs were able to inhibit (125)i-collagen binding to cna-(151-318) as well as to intact s. aureus cells. they also interfered with the attachment of bacteria to collagen substrates. furthermore, some of the mabs could effectively displace (125)i-collagen bound to the bacteria. these displacing mabs were also able to detach bacteria that had adhered to a collagen substrate in a preincubation, raising the possibility that some of the mabs may be used as therapeutic agents.

AB  == to evaluate the resistance for major oral antimicrobial agents, mainly new quinolones, we carried out a drug susceptibility surveillance of 3,050 strains of 11 microbial species clinically isolated at 8 institutions such as general hospitals and examination centers in hiroshima city. 10 antimicrobial agents were used: 3 new quinolone drugs, 5 beta-lactam drugs, minocycline and clarithromycin. among gram-positive bacteria, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)  and enterococcus faecalis showed low susceptibility to the new quinolone drugs, while methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive to these drugs. among gram-negative bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa showed high resistance for the new quinolone drugs, but enteric bacteria and haemophilus influenzae did not show marked resistance, maintaining almost good sensitivity to these drugs. to reduce the appearance of resistant bacteria, appropriate antimicrobial agents should be selected. drug susceptibility surveillance in the community will be also important in the future.

AB  == objective: assessment of incidence and behavior of mediastinitis after cardiac transplantation. methods: from 1985 to 1999, 214 cardiac transplantations were performed, 12 (5.6%) of the transplanted patients developed confirmed mediastinitis. patient's ages ranged from 42 to 66 years (mean of 52.3 +/- 10.0 years) and 10 (83.3%) patients were males. seven (58.3%) patients showed sternal  stability on palpation, 4 (33.3%) patients had pleural empyema, and 2 (16.7%) patients did not show purulent secretion draining through the wound. results: staphylococcus aureus was the infectious agent identified in the wound secretion  or in the mediastinum, or both, in 8 (66.7%) patients. staphylococcus epidermidis was identified in 2 (16.7%) patients, enterococcus faecalis in 1 (8.3%) patient,  and the cause of mediastinitis could not be determined in 1 (8.3%) patient. surgical treatment was performed on an emergency basis, and the extension of the  debridement varied with local conditions. in 2 (16.7%) patients, we chose to leave the surgical wound open and performed daily dressings with granulated sugar. total sternal resection was performed in only 1 (8.3%) patient. out of this series, 5 (41.7%) patients died, and the causes of death were related to the infection. autopsy revealed persistence of mediastinitis in 1 (8.3%) patient. conclusion: promptness in diagnosing mediastinitis and precocious surgical drainage have changed the natural evolution of this disease. nevertheless, observance of the basic precepts of prophylaxis of infection is still the best way to treat mediastinitis.

AB  == the bacteriostatic potency of the cerium-humic acid complex was evaluated by experimental measurement of this complex interaction with e. coli, bacillus pyocyaneus, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc and streptococcus faecalis, and by comparison bacteriostatic effects with the cerium-citrate complex. the experimental results indicated that the cerium-humic acid complex strongly inhibited growth of all five bacterial strains, and its diameter of bacteriostatic circles were more than 30 mm. the minimal bacteria-inhibiting concentration were 1 x 10(-3), 2 x 10(-3) and 1 x 10(-2) mol/l for e. coli and bacillus pyocyaneus, staphylococcus aureus, and leuconostoc and streptococcus faecalis individually, and the measured minimal bactericidal concentrations were  2 x 10(-3) and 1 x 10(-2) mol/l for bacillus pyocyaneus, e. coli, and leuconostoc. to kill staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis, the concentration had to be more than 1 x 10(-20 mol/l. on the contrary, we found that cerium-citrate complex did not inhibit the growth of the above five bacteria, but stimulated bacterial growth. the completely different bacteriostatic results of two cerium complexes may hint that the association and  chemical properties of the two complexes were different.

TI  == diversity of ace, a gene encoding a microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecules, from different strains of enterococcus faecalis and evidence for production of ace during human infections.
AB  == our previous work reported that most enterococcus faecalis strains adhered to the extracellular matrix proteins collagen types i and iv and laminin after growth at 46 degrees c, but not 37 degrees c, and we subsequently identified an e. faecalis sequence, ace, that encodes a bacterial adhesin similar to the collagen binding protein cna of staphylococcus aureus. in this study, we examined the diversity of e. faecalis-specific ace gene sequences among different isolates obtained from various geographic regions as well as from various clinical sources. a comparison of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of ace from nine e. faecalis strains identified a highly conserved n-terminal a domain, followed by a variable b domain which contains two to five repeats of 47 amino acids in tandem array, preceded by a 20-amino-acid partial repeat. using 17 other strains collected worldwide, the 5' region of ace that encodes the a domain was sequenced, and these sequences showed > or =97.5% identity. among the previously reported five amino acids critical for collagen binding by cna of s. aureus, four were found to be identical in ace from all strains tested. polyclonal immune rabbit serum prepared against recombinant ace a derived from e. faecalis strain og1rf detected ace in mutanolysin extracts of seven of nine e. faecalis strains after growth at  46 degrees c; ace was detected in four different molecular sizes that correspond  to the variation in the b repeat region. to determine if there was any evidence to indicate that ace might be produced under physiological conditions, we quantitatively assayed sera collected from patients with enterococcal infections  for the presence of anti-ace a antibodies. ninety percent of sera (19 of 21) from patients with e. faecalis endocarditis showed reactivity with titers from 1:32 to >1:1,024; the only 2 sera which lacked antibodies to ace a had considerably lower titers of antibodies to other e. faecalis antigens as well. human-derived, anti-ace a immunoglobulins g purified from an e. faecalis endocarditis patient serum inhibited adherence of 46 degrees c-grown e. faecalis og1rf to collagen types i and iv and laminin. in conclusion, these results show that ace is highly  conserved among isolates of e. faecalis, with at least four variants related to the differences in the b domain, is expressed by different strains during infection in humans, and human-derived antibodies can block adherence to these extracellular matrix proteins.

TI  == antibacterial activities of temporin a analogs.
AB  == temporin a (ta) is a small, basic, highly hydrophobic, antimicrobial peptide amide (flpligrvlsgil-nh2) found in the skin of the european red frog, rana temporaria. it has variable antibiotic activities against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including clinically important methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus as well as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium strains. in this investigation the antimicrobial activity and structural  characteristics of ta synthetic analogs were studied. for antibacterial activity  against s. aureus and enterococcal strains, the hydrophobicity of the n-terminal  amino acid of ta was found to be important as well as a positive charge at amino  acid position 7, and bulky hydrophobic side chains at positions 5 and 12. replacing isoleucine with leucine at amino acid positions 5 and 12 resulted in the greatest enhancement of antibacterial activity. in addition, there was little difference between the activities of ta and its all-d enantiomer, indicating that the peptide probably exerts its effect on bacteria via non-chiral interactions with membrane lipids.

TI  == inactivation of the stress- and starvation-inducible gls24 operon has a pleiotrophic effect on cell morphology, stress sensitivity, and gene expression in enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis induces the synthesis of at least 42 proteins during 24 h of glucose starvation. because of its induction during carbohydrate and complete  starvation (incubation in tap water) and cdcl(2) and bile salts stresses, one of  these proteins (gls24) was qualified as a "general stress protein" and was analyzed at the molecular level. its corresponding gene, gls24, seems to be the penultimate gene of an operon composed, altogether, of six open reading frames (orfs). the orf preceding gls24 (orf4) showed very strong identity with gls24. the deduced polypeptides of these two genes showed similarity with a 20-kda hypothetical protein from lactococcus lactis and an alkaline stress protein from  staphylococcus aureus with no previously known biological significance. data from the operon sequence and northern analysis led to the conclusions that (i) gls24 possesses its own promoter which is especially induced at the onset of starvation and (ii) the operon promoter is stress inducible in exponential-phase cells. a mutation in the gls24 gene led to a severe reduction of growth rate and reduction of survival against 0.3% bile salts in the 24-h-starved cells compared to the wild-type strain. moreover, the chain length of the mutant is significantly reduced during growth. these results argue strongly for a role of the protein gls24 and/or glsb in morphological changes and in stress tolerance in e. faecalis. comparison of two-dimensional protein gels from wild-type cells with those from gls24 mutant cells revealed a pleiotropic effect of the mutation on gene expression. at least nine proteins were present in larger amounts in the mutant. for six of them, the corresponding n-terminal microsequence has been obtained. three of these sequences map in genes coding for l-lactate dehydrogenase, lipoamide dehydrogenase, and pyruvate decarboxylase, all involved  in pyruvate metabolism.

AB  == background and objectives: a photochemical process has been tested for the inactivation of viruses and bacteria in buffy-coat derived platelet concentrates  (bc pcs). materials and methods: bc pcs in 35% cpd plasma and 65% platelet-additive solution (pas iii) were exposed to photochemical treatment (pct) with 150 microm of the psoralen s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) treatment with long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva, 320-400 nm). platelet function was evaluated following pct using a panel of in vitro assays. results: this pct process was highly effective at inactivating gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia  marcescens). no viable bacteria were detected following pct and 7 days of platelet storage while bacterial growth was detected in paired untreated control  bc pcs. complete inactivation of the gram-positive bacillus cereus was achieved only in one of two replicate experiments with bc pcs. pct was also highly effective for inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 in bc pcs inoculated with approximately 10(6) tissue culture infectious doses per milliliter (tcid(50)/ml) of cell-associated hiv-1. rapid inactivation was observed with increasing uva doses: with 150 microm s-59 and a 1 j/cm(2) treatment of uva, a reduction of 5.6+/-0.5 log tcid(50)/ml was achieved, and a reduction of >6.4 log tcid(50)/ml was achieved with 150 microm s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) treatment of uva. no physiologically relevant differences in platelet functions were found between the test and the control bc pcs during 7 days of storage. conclusion: pct with 150 microm s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) uva treatment does  not adversely affect in vitro properties of bc pcs stored at 22 degrees c for 7 days. the pct process inactivated bacteria and hiv-1 inoculated into the bc pcs.  these results extend the earlier reported efficacy of pct apheresis pcs to bc pcs.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == comparison of a rabbit model of bacterial endocarditis and an in vitro infection  model with simulated endocardial vegetations.
AB  == animal models are commonly used to determine the efficacy of various antimicrobial agents for treatment of bacterial endocarditis. previously we have  utilized an in vitro infection model, which incorporates simulated endocardial vegetations (sevs) to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of various antibiotics. in the present study, we compared four experimental rabbit endocarditis protocols to an in vitro infection model in an effort to determine if these models are comparable. we have evaluated the activity of clinafloxacin, trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin in rabbit models against staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus spp. in vitro models were performed simulating the antibiotic pharmacokinetics obtained in the in vivo studies. models were dosed the same as rabbit models, and sevs were evaluated at the same time the rabbit vegetations were examined. clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin were evaluated against methicillin-susceptible (mssa1199) and -resistant (mrsa494) strains of s. aureus. ciprofloxacin was studied against mssa1199 and mssa487. sparfloxacin and clinafloxacin were evaluated against enterococcus faecium sf2149 and enterococcus faecalis wh245, respectively. we found that reductions in sev bacterial density obtained in the in vitro model were similar to those obtained in rabbit vegetations, indicating that the sev model may be a valuable tool for assessing antibiotic potential in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == a new rapid automated method for the detection of listeria from environmental swabs and sponges.
AB  == many food and meat processors test environmental swabs and sponges to confirm the absence of listeria spp. spectral pattern changes in a liquid growth medium, resulting from esculin hydrolysis by listeria in contaminated swabs and sponges,  were automatically monitored by the biosys instrument in a semifluid layer (sfl). the blackening of sfl in modified mox broth resulted in sharply declining curves, which were easily detected by the instrument. the instrument detected all nine strains of listeria monocytogenes tested. none of the gram negative organisms (proteus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas, citrobacter and yersinia) were detected  by the system, nor were most gram positive organisms, including bacillus, streptococcus, and lactobacillus strains, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis, which hydrolyze esculin, produced black colonies on palcam and oxford media and were also detected in the system. a total of 122 sponges and swabs collected at food processing plants were evaluated by this method. of these, 99 were negative, and 11 were positive. l. innocua was the dominant listeria species in these environmental samples. good correlation was obtained between numbers of listeria and detection times of esculin hydrolysis: 1000 cfu/swab were detected in 10-13 h, whereas 1-10 cfu/swab were detected in less than 22 h. the total assay time was 26 h.

TI  == [the vaginal bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
AB  == the composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. the study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. adolescentis 2 and b.  longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. bifidum g1, b. breve p2 and  b. longum z4 inhibited klebsiella ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while b. bifidum g1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to b. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. in addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

AB  == a novel bacteriolytic enzyme cwha (cell wall hydrolytic amidase) was purified by  ion exchange and gel-filtration chromatographies from a commercial bacteriolytic  preparation from achromobacter lyticus. cwha exhibited optimal ph at 8.5 and lysed chcl(3)-treated escherichia coli more efficiently than micrococcus luteus,  staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and pediococcus acidilactici. the enzyme was inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline strongly and by edta to a lesser extent, suggesting that it is probably a metalloenzyme. amino acid composition and mass spectrometric analyses for the cwha-derived m. luteus muropeptides revealed that cwha is n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase [ec 3.5.1. 28]. the complete amino acid sequence of cwha was established by a combination of edman degradation and mass spectrometry for peptides obtained by achromobacter protease i (api) digestion and cyanogen bromide (cnbr) cleavage. the enzyme consists of a  single polypeptide chain of 177 amino acid residues with one disulfide bond, cys114-cys121. cwha was found to be homologous to n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase from bacteriophage t7 (bpt7). its sequence identity with bpt7 is 35%, but the amino acid residues functioning as zinc ligands in bpt7 are absent in cwha. these results suggest that cwha is a new type of n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the usa.
AB  == the antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (sb-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 gram-positive and 995 gram-negative organisms collected from various usa sites. time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) 0. 016 mg/l), streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/l), streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/l), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (0.03 mg/l), staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/l), staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/l) and enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/l). against gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. mic(90)s for gemifloxacin were: haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008  mg/l), moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/l), escherichia coli (0.016 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/l), klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/l), enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/l), enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/l), proteus spp. (4 mg/l), serratia spp. (1 mg/l), citrobacter freundii (2 mg/l), morganella morganii (0.12  mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/l), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/l) and acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/l). gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x mic. the pae for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at  2 and 4 x mic, although longer paes were observed with h. influenzae, p. aeruginosa and proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x mic) and shorter paes with e. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and k. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). in conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. it has substantially improved potency against gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. it retains the good gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged paes.

TI  == structure-activity relationships in the series of eremomycin carboxamides.
AB  == a series of new carboxamides of the glycopeptide antibiotic eremomycin was synthesized and investigated in vitro. the goal of the study was the comparison of the influence of the substituents introduced onto the eremomycin skeleton on the activity of these compounds against vancomycin susceptible and resistant bacterial strains. eremomycin amides derived from amines with small substituents  (c0 approximately c4) demonstrated antibacterial activity against vancomycin susceptible strains similar to that of the parent antibiotic and were inactive against vancomycin resistant strains. the derivatives of alkylamines with linear  lipophilic substituents (like c10h21) were active against vana and vanb enterococci strains with the scope of activity similar to that of n'-decyl or 7d-ch2nh-decyl eremomycins described earlier. eremomycin amides of 5-methoxy- and 5-benzyloxytryptamine were active both against vancomycin susceptible and resistant strains. the introduction of a spacer (lysine or piperazine) between the decyl and antibiotic moieties did not seriously influence antibacterial properties of the compounds in comparison with the corresponding derivatives without a spacer. the most active carboxamides are of interest for secondary modifications of the antibiotic.

TI  == problems associated with the direct viable count procedure applied to gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == despite the numerous advantages of fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) for identifying a single bacterial cell with 16s rrna probes, problems are encountered with starving bacteria in natural samples. the original direct viable count procedure (dvc) includes a revivification step in the presence of an antibiotic inhibiting cell division. cells elongate and accumulate ribosomes. this results in a natural amplification of 16s rrna molecules (target of fish). however, it is limited to gram-negative bacteria which are sensitive to nalidixic acid. the objective of this study was to develop a procedure for estimating the number of metabolically active gram-positive staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis cells by the use of a method which combines the number of substrate-responsive cells and their identification by fish. it was observed that no single published dvc method could apply to taxonomically different gram-positive bacteria. since cells were not counted, the revivification step in  presence of nalidixic acid will be referred to as revivification without cell division. for each species, different low-nutrient media and complex media, different fluoroquinolones and beta-lactam antibiotics, concentrations of antibiotics, combinations of antibiotics, temperature and time were evaluated using bacteria in different physiological states and in natural samples. enumeration of bacteria by plate counts and direct fish were compared. the improved procedure should yield information about the physiological state, the taxonomic identity, and the enumeration of viable gram-positive bacteria. the application of dvc to an entire ecosystem is presently still a challenge.

TI  == effects of enterococcus faecalis fsr genes on production of gelatinase and a serine protease and virulence.
AB  == three agr-like genes (fsra, fsrb, and fsrc, for enterococcus faecalis regulator)  were found upstream of the previously reported gelatinase gene (gele) and a downstream putative serine protease gene (spre; accession number z12296) of enterococcus faecalis og1rf. the deduced amino acid sequence of fsra shows 26% identity and 38% similarity to staphylococcus aureus agra (the response regulator of the accessory gene regulator system in the agr locus), fsrb shows 23% identity and 41% similarity to s. aureus agrb, and fsrc shows 23% identity and 36% similarity to s. aureus agrc (the sensor transducer of agr system). northern blot analysis suggested that gele and spre are cotranscribed and that fsrb and fsrc are also cotranscribed in og1rf. northern blot analysis of fsra, fsrb, fsrc, gele, and spre insertion mutants showed that fsrb, fsrc, gele, and spre are not expressed in fsra, fsrb, and fsrc mutants, while insertion in an open reading frame further upstream of fsra did not effect the expression of these genes, suggesting that agr-like genes may be autoregulated and that they regulate gele and spre expression, as further confirmed by complementation of fsr gene mutations with a 6-kb fragment which contains all three fsr genes in the shuttle  vector, pat18. testing of 95 other isolates of e. faecalis showed that 62% produced gelatinase (gel(+)), while 91% (including all gel(+) strains) hybridized to a gele probe; 71% (including all gel(+) strains) hybridized to an fsr probe, corroborating the conclusion that both gele and fsr are necessary for gelatinase  production. testing of fsra, fsrb, and spre mutants in a mouse peritonitis model  showed that spre and agr-like gene mutants resulted in highly significantly prolonged survival compared to the parent strain og1rf, a finding similar to what we had previously shown for a gele mutant. these results suggest that spre and agr-like genes contribute to the virulence of e. faecalis og1rf in this model.

TI  == three-year surveillance study of nosocomial bacterial resistance in argentina. the antimicrobial committee; and the national surveillance program (sir) participants group.
AB  == introduction: a national surveillance program (sir) was introduced in 1996 in argentina by the antimicrobial committee of the argentinean society for microbiology to assess bacterial resistance. the present study reports the rates  of nosocomial bacterial resistance found by this program. methods: a 2-month point-prevalence study was conducted twice yearly (i.e., april-may and october-november) from 1996 to 1998, by 27 argentinean centers. susceptibility testing was carried out by the disk diffusion method following the national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. results: in all, 6343 isolates recovered from 5603 inpatients (> or =48-hr hospitalization) were included. methicillin resistance was 58% and 56% in staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), respectively. although no vancomycin resistance was found in staphylococci, 2% and 8% of the s. aureus and cns strains, respectively, proved resistant to teicoplanin. no ampicillin resistance  was displayed by enterococcus faecalis. high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance in enterococci were 33% and 37%, respectively. acquired glycopeptide resistance in enterococci emerged in 1997 (2%). imipenem resistance in acinetobacter spp and pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9% and 21%, respectively. among  enterobacteriaceae, 1% and 5% of the klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae isolates, respectively, proved resistant to imipenem. ceftazidime and cefepime resistance was found in 63% and 33% of the e. cloacae strains. resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was shown by 48%, 26%, and 8% of the k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and escherichia coli isolates, respectively. conclusions: the alarming rates of resistance found in this study provide compelling evidence of the need for more rational use of antimicrobial agents in argentina.

TI  == group b streptococci and other gram-positive cocci bind to cytokeratin 8.
AB  == group b streptococci (gbs) adhere to surface receptors present on epithelial cells; these receptors include fibronectin and laminin. to identify other possible receptors, plasma membranes from a549 cells, a respiratory tract epithelial cell line, were prepared. these plasma membranes were tested in a protein blot analysis using radiolabeled gbs as a probe. gbs adhered to two species, with molecular masses of 50 kda (p50) and 57 kda (p57). we concluded that p50 and p57 correspond to two forms of cytokeratin 8 (ck8) on the basis of the following results: (i) protein blot results demonstrated that p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with two forms of ck8 after separation by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page); (ii) p50 and p57 exactly comigrated with ck8 after separation by two-dimensional page; (iii) ck8 in solution bound to gbs, as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of proteins from a549 lysates that bound to gbs in a liquid-phase assay; and (iv) radiolabeled gbs bound to a549 lysate-derived ck8 that had been captured in anti-ck8-coated microtiter wells. ck8 bound to coh1-13, an acapsular mutant of coh1, demonstrating that adherence is not mediated by capsular polysaccharide. trypsin-treated gbs did not bind to ck8, indicating that adherence is mediated via a protein on the surface of gbs. soluble ck8 bound to six of six gbs strains  tested. soluble ck8 also bound to staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes. we hypothesize that adherence  of gbs to cytokeratin may be important for maintenance of colonization at sites of keratinized epithelium, such as the vagina, or for adherence of these bacteria to damaged epithelial cells at other sites.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of mefloquine and a series of related compounds.
AB  == mefloquine was found to have bactericidal activity against methicillin- and fluoroquinolone-susceptible and -resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis and gentamicin- and vancomycin-resistant strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium. the mics were 16 microg/ml, and the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were 16 to 32 microg/ml. these concentrations cannot be achieved in serum. mefloquine was active at a more achievable concentration against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with mics of 0.2 to 1.5 microg/ml. mefloquine was not active against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. in an attempt to find more active derivatives, 400 mefloquine-related compounds were selected from the chemical inventory of the walter reed army institute of research. we identified a series of compounds containing a piperidine methanol group attached to pyridine,  quinoline, and benzylquinoline ring systems. these had activities similar to that of mefloquine against s. pneumoniae but were far more active against other gram-positive bacteria (mics for staphylococci, 0.8 to 6.3 microg/ml). they had activities similar to that of amphotericin b against candida spp. and cryptococcus neoformans. combinations of the compounds with gentamicin and vancomycin were additive against staphylococci and pneumococci. the mic and mbc of gentamicin were decreased by four- to eightfold when this drug was combined with limiting dilutions of the compounds. there was no antagonism with other antimicrobial drugs. the compounds were rapidly bactericidal. they appear to act  by disrupting cell membranes. combinations of the compounds with aminoglycoside antibiotics may have potential for therapeutic use.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == a comparison of antimicrobial resistance rates in gram-positive pathogens isolated in the uk from october 1996 to january 1997 and october 1997 to january  1998.
AB  == rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 teaching, nine associate teaching and nine district general hospitals) in the uk were compared.  combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in teaching  hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for associate teaching and district  general hospitals rates fell (associate teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; district general 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). using conventional methodology to determine mics, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. for streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). for enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year  1, 15.1% year 2, p = 0.0388). for enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin  and rifampicin.

TI  == [acquired antibiotic resistance in madagascar: first evaluation].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of acquired resistance to antibiotics in madagascar. testing was carried out on total of 1267 strains of medically significant bacteria isolated from specimens sent to the pasteur institute of madagascar in antananarivo between october 1997 and october 1998. antibiograms were performed using the diffusion technique on gel media with antibiotic disks. results were read according to the criteria of the antibiogram  committee of the french society of microbiology. preliminary findings documented  a high incidence of resistance to widely available, low-price antibiotics including penicillin g and tetracycline for which 84 p. 100 and 65 p. 100 of staphylococcus aureus respectively demonstrated resistance; tetracyclin to which  80 p. 100 of streptococcus were resistant; and ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and phenicoles to which 60 p. 100, 60 p. 100 and 28 p. 100 of escherichia coli respectively and 77 p. 100, 83 p. 100, and 71 p. 100 of shigella sp. respectively were resistant. second-line antibiotics including penicillin m, macrolides, nalidixic acid, and nitrofuranes were still relatively active, thus providing an  effective alternative. newly developed antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporines were highly effective but a few resistant strains were observed. although not representative of madagascar as a whole, the  findings of this preliminary study indicate that acquired resistance must be taken into account in designing simplified decision charts for front-line laboratories, that appropriate information must be made available to health care  workers, and that further testing is needed to monitor the evolution of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == the in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) and by determining kill-times. the mics of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. the mic was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. even lower mic values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for haemophilus influenzae and for candida tropicalis. mic and mbc values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the mfc for c. tropicalis and c. albicans was much higher. only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a mic value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus showed mic at 62.5 micrograms/ml. the mic and  mbc values among the isolates were comparable, while the mfc value for the yeasts was greater. a concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for s. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for s. pyogenes, s. dysgalactiae and s. mutans and for moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.

TI  == rapid identification of bacteria in blood cultures by using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes.
AB  == the applicability of whole-cell hybridization for the identification of pathogenic bacteria in blood from septic patients was examined. oligonucleotide probes, fluorescently labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, directed against the variable regions of the 16s rrnas of the following bacterial species and/or genera were used: streptococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the enterobacteriaceae family. a probe specific for the rrnas of  almost all bacteria and its complementary, reversed counterpart was used as positive and negative control, respectively. the probes were used in conjunction  with a fast and simple-to-use protocol for whole-cell hybridization. this protocol yields an identification after 25 to 45 min, depending on whether the bacterium is gram positive or gram negative. a total of 182 blood samples which tested positive in a blood culture machine were investigated. all probes except for the ones for s. aureus and the cons showed sensitivities and specificities of 1.000. it was concluded that whole-cell hybridization is well suited for the fast screening of septic blood containing streptococci and/or enterococci or gram-negative rods.

TI  == surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, 1998.
AB  == for the first national surveillance of antibiotic resistance in taiwan, we collected in 1998 from 22 hospitals (6 medical centers, 15 regional hospitals, and 1 local hospital) 3,211 isolates in all parts of the country. besides 50 random successive isolates from inpatients, each hospital was requested to collect 25 isolates each from positive blood cultures, hospital-acquired infections, outpatients and the pediatric department. we re-speciated all the submitted specimens and determined their antibiotic susceptibility patterns. the  most common isolates were enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. among hospital-acquired infections, acinetobacter spp. were among those which accounted for over 10% of the isolates. the oxacillin resistance of s. aureus was 82% in isolates from hospital-acquired infections, and 40% from outpatients. among enterococcus spp., 85% were either e. faecalis or e. faecium. they were 14% resistant to vancomycin. among gram-negative bacteria, k. pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumanii were hospital-acquired isolates that were most clearly more resistant than community acquired isolates. this difference was less apparent in the case of enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa. these bacteria were generally more resistant from all sources. fifty-one percent of salmonella were resistant to ampicillin; however, these were all sensitive to ciprofloxacin. isolates from the east were least resistant. plotting the disc zone diameters of antibiotics within the susceptible range, we  identified subpopulations with smaller diameters in the case of vancomycin against s. aureus, ciprofloxacin against e. coli, and ciprofloxacin against salmonella spp. these findings represent one of the purposes of this surveillance as they may portend developing resistances which bear careful watching in the future.

TI  == bacteraemia and antibiotic resistance of its pathogens reported in england and wales between 1990 and 1998: trend analysis.
AB  == objectives: determination of causes, trends, and antibiotic resistance in reports of bacterial pathogens isolated from blood in england and wales from 1990 to 1998. design: description of bacterial isolates from blood, judged to be clinically significant by microbiology staff, reported to the communicable disease surveillance centre. setting: microbiology laboratories in england and wales. subjects: patients yielding clinically significant isolates from blood. main outcome measures: frequency and poisson regression analyses for trend of reported causes of bacteraemia and proportions of antibiotic resistant isolates.  results: there was an upward trend in total numbers of reports of bacteraemia. the five most cited organisms accounted for over 60% of reports each year. there  was a substantial increase in the proportion of reports of staphylococcus aureus  resistant to methicillin, streptococcus pneumoniae resistance to penicillin and erythromycin, and enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium resistance to vancomycin. no increase was seen in resistance of escherichia coli to gentamicin. conclusions: reports from laboratories provide valuable information on trends and antibiotic resistance in bacteraemia and show a worrying increase in resistance to important antibiotics.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of camphorated chloroxylenol (ed 84) in the treatment of infected root canals.
AB  == during and after chemomechanical preparation, particularly before the definitive  filling of an infected root canal, a temporary intracanal dressing with an antimicrobial activity is generally indicated. therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of ed 84, a liquid root canal disinfectant containing chloroxylenol (10%) and camphor (15%), against selected test organisms (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli,  and candida albicans) both in vitro and under clinical conditions, using extracted teeth. with a contact time of 180 min between undiluted ed 84 and the four bacterial suspensions in the canal, there was a 2 to 3 log reduction in the  number of organisms. under in vitro conditions, the reduction was even greater than 3 logs. when using a liquid medication as a temporary root canal dressing for a duration of approximately 2 days, ed 84 can definitely be used.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of vancomycin in the presence and absence of sodium carboxymethyl starch.
AB  == the purpose of this work was to determine any effects the presence of sodium carboxymethyl starch may have on the antimicrobial activity of vancomycin given a previously described interaction between vancomycin and sodium carboxymethyl starch. in particular, the in-vitro activity of vancomycin against two clinically relevant bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, was studied in the presence of varying concentrations of sodium carboxymethyl starch. from two independent studies conducted using an agar dilution method, it appeared that the binding of vancomycin to sodium carboxymethyl starch had no effect on the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of vancomycin. the minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin against s. aureus in the presence of as much as 1 mg  ml(-1) sodium carboxymethyl starch was similar to that of the control where no sodium carboxymethyl starch was added (1-4 microg ml(-1) vs 1-2 microg ml(-1), respectively). likewise, the minimum inhibitory concentration of vancomycin against e. faecalis in the presence of 1 mg ml(-1) sodium carboxymethyl starch was also similar to that of the control where no sodium carboxymethyl starch was  added (1-4 microg ml(-1) vs 1-4 microg ml(-1), respectively). however, there may  be factors in the in-vitro method, such as high ionic strength, that could disrupt the interaction between vancomycin and sodium carboxymethyl starch. therefore, the possibility of diminished vancomycin activity in-vivo cannot be ruled out. a small percentage (8-10%) of vancomycin was determined to be bound to sodium carboxymethyl starch in broth media. given these results, the impact of sodium carboxymethyl starch on the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of vancomycin  is expected to be minimal. binding studies could not be conducted with gelled agar due to its semi-solid state.

TI  == it is possible to use herbarium specimens to screen for antibacterial components  in some plants.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of herbarium specimens of combretum erythrophyllum growing in the pretoria area and originally collected between 92 and 12 years ago were compared with freshly collected leaves. there were no differences in the minimal inhibitory concentration of the different samples with staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa as test organisms. there were only minor differences in chromatograms separating terpenoids and flavonoids. light fungal infection indicated by small spots on herbarium leaves generally did not influence the mic value or the chromatographic profile much, but heavy fungal attack decreased the biological activity of the extracts. application of the technique to helichrysum pedunculatum specimens showed that the chemical components apparently did not change over a period of 100 years and the biological activity did not decrease. the examination of herbarium material may be a useful first step to screen plants with stable biologically active components or to establish a scientific base for the use of a plant in traditional medicine.

TI  == potential of an antibacterial ultraviolet-irradiated nylon film.
AB  == the antibacterial effectiveness of an ultraviolet-irradiated nylon 6, 6 film was  investigated for potential use as a food-packaging material to reduce the surface microbial contamination of foods. the film-surface analyses showed that uv irradiation induced conversion of surface amide groups to amines. irradiation also increased the dimensional scale of the film surface topography (depth of valleys) approximately 5-fold on the scale of nanometers. the irradiated nylon demonstrated antagonistic activity against staphylococcus aureus 25923 and escherichia coli tv1058 with 4.5 and 6 log reductions, respectively, of an initial population of 10(6) cfu ml(-1). the irradiated nylon was ineffective against pseudomonas fluorescens 13525 and enterococcus faecalis 19433 under similar conditions. the film demonstrated increased antimicrobial activity against s. aureus 25923 with increasing temperatures up to 45 degrees c, the highest temperature tested. protein and salt inhibited the antibacterial nature of the irradiated film. amines in solution (4.31 x 10(-8) m; the calculated equivalent of amines on the film) killed at least 1 x 10(4) cfu ml(-1) e. coli tv1058, and 4. 31 x 10(-7) m amines killed up to 1 x 10(7) cfu ml(-1) e. coli tv1058. the amines in solution required similar exposure time to the bacteria for population reduction as was observed with the irradiated film.

AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin, formerly bay 12-8039, against gram-positive bacteria was tested by the agar dilution method. a total of 189 isolates that included staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, streptococci, rhodococci, leuconostocs, pediococci, lactobacilli, and diphtheroids were tested. moxifloxacin showed greater potency than ciprofloxacin  against s. aureus, streptococci, and enterococci, having minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) lower than those of ciprofloxacin by 2- to 64-fold. this improved activity was most prominent for s. aureus. moxifloxacin was active against leuconostoc and rhodococcus species. time-kill studies using moxifloxacin at a concentration of 3 micrograms/ml against one isolate each of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mssa) (mic, 0.031 microgram/ml), mrsa (mic, 1 microgram/ml), two isolates of e. faecalis (mics, 0.25 and 2 micrograms/ml), and  two isolates of vancomycin-resistant e. faecium (mics, 0.25 and 2 micrograms/ml)  revealed an average decrease in colony forming unit (cfu) by 3.8, 0.4, 4.0, 2.0,  4.2, and 1.8 log10 cfu/ml at 24 h, respectively. moxifloxacin is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with improved in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria. further studies of the in vivo activity of this compound appear warranted.

AB  == the intragenomic heterogeneity of the bacterial intergenic (16s-23s rdna) spacer  region (isr) was analysed from the following species in which sequences for the complete rrna operon (rrn) set have been determined (rrn number): enterococcus faecalis (6) and e. faecium (6), bacillus subtilis (10), staphylococcus aureus (9), vibrio cholerae (4), haemophilus influenzae (6) and escherichia coli (7). it was found that some spacer sequence blocks were highly conserved between operons  of a genome, whereas the presence of others was variable. when these variations were analysed using the program plato and partial likelihood phylogenies determined by dnaml for each operon set, three regions showed significant (z>3.3) spatial variation [region i was 78-184 nt long (2.1<z<49.4), region ii was 10-60  nt long (3.7<z<23)] and region iii was 6 nt long (3.4<z>4.4) possibly due to recombination or selection. within region i, there was sequence block variation in all operon sets [some operons contained trna genes (trnaala, trnaile or trnaglu), whereas others had sequence blocks such as vs2 (s. aureus) or rsl (e. coli)]. q analysis of the isr sequence from e. faecalis and e. faecium showed that there was more interspecies than intraspecies variation (both in dna sequence and in the presence or absence of blocks). dot matrix analysis of the sequence blocks in the nine rrn isrs from s. aureus showed that there was significant homology between vs2 and vs5/vs6. furthermore, repeat motifs with only a or t were present in higher copy numbers in vs5/vs6 than in vs2. since these sequence blocks (vs2 and vs5-vs6) are related, intragenic evolution resulting in at expansion may have occurred between these two regions. a model is proposed that postulates a role for recombination and at-expansion in intra-genomic isr variations. this process may represent a general mechanism of concerted evolution for bacterial isr rearrangements.

TI  == in vitro activity of levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro activity of levofloxacin was investigated against 256 clinical strains of four gram-positive genera (staphylococcus, streptococcus, enterococcus, and listeria). ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used as comparators. uniform susceptibility to levofloxacin was recorded among methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci other than streptococcus agalactiae, regardless of their being susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to  penicillin (s. pneumoniae) or erythromycin (s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae), in enterococci other than enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, and in listeria monocytogenes isolates. moreover, 1 of 22 s. agalactiae isolates and 1 of 19 e. faecium isolates was resistant, and 2 of 19 were intermediate. resistances to levofloxacin with mic90s in the resistance range were only observed in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and e. faecalis isolates. in any case, the mics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were usually 2-4 times higher than those of levofloxacin. in time-kill assays using three test strains (a methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus isolate, a penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae isolate, and an e. faecalis isolate), the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.

TI  == the synthesis and antibacterial activity of totarol derivatives. part 1: modifications of ring-c and pro-drugs.
AB  == a series of analogues of, and potential pro-drugs derived from, the potent antibacterial diterpene totarol (1) were synthesized in order to elucidate the minimum structural requirements for antibacterial activity and to seek compounds  with good bioavailability in vivo. these analogues varied in the structural features of their aromatic rings and the prodrugs were o-glycosylated derivatives. they were tested in vitro against three gram-positive bacteria: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa); and against the gram-negative multi-drug-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae. none of the analogues was more potent than totarol itself, which is effective against these gram-positive bacteria at mic values of 7 microm. the results were evaluated in terms of a structure-activity relationship and this showed that a phenolic moiety was essential for potent antibacterial activity. amongst the pro-drugs, totaryl alpha-d-mannopyranoside (22) proved the most active in vitro (mic 18 microm). the in vivo antibacterial activities of compounds 1, 22 and totarol beta-lactoside (23) were assessed in a mouse model of infection, but they were found to be ineffective. compounds 1 and 22 were shown to be cytotoxic towards proliferating  human cell cultures, ch 2983, hela, and mg 63, but only at concentrations of > 30 microm.

TI  == ace is a collagen-binding mscramm from enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == a putative collagen-binding mscramm, ace, of enterococcus faecalis was identified by searching bacterial genome data bases for proteins containing domains homologous to the ligand-binding region of cna, the collagen-binding mscramm from staphylococcus aureus. ace was predicted to have a molecular mass of 71 kda and contains features characteristic of cell surface proteins on gram-positive bacteria, including a lpxtg motif for cross-linking to the cell wall. the n-terminal region of ace contained a region (residues 174-319) in which 56% of the residues are identical or similar when compared with the minimal ligand-binding region of cna (cna 151-318); the remainder of the ace a domain has 46% similarity with the corresponding region of the cna a domain. antibodies raised against recombinant ace a domain were used to verify the cell surface expression of ace on e. faecalis. these antibodies also effectively inhibited the adhesion of enterococcal cells to a collagen substrate, suggesting that ace is a  functional collagen-binding mscramm. structural modeling of the conserved region  in ace (residues 174-319) suggested a structure very similar to that reported for residues 151-318 of the cna collagen-binding domain in which the ligand-binding site was identified as a trench transversing a beta-sheet face (symersky, j., patti, j. m., carson, m., house-pompeo, k., teale, m., moore, d., jin, l., delucas, l. j., hook, m., and narayana, s. v. l. (1997) nat. struct. biol. 10, 833-838). biochemical analyses of recombinant ace and cna a domains supported the modeling data in that the secondary structures were similar as determined by cd spectroscopy and both proteins bound at multiple sites in type i collagen with micromolar affinities, but with different apparent kinetics. we conclude that ace is a collagen-binding mscramm on enterococci and is structurally and functionally related to the staphylococcal cna protein.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

AB  == to assess the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens among the most common bloodstream isolates, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility data from the surveillance network database-usa, an electronic surveillance system that collects data from 118 clinical microbiology laboratories across the united states. between 1995 and 1997, resistance to both vancomycin and ampicillin was much more prevalent among enterococcus faecium than enterococcus faecalis, suggesting the need for laboratories to identify to species. when staphylococcal  isolates were examined for reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (minimum inhibitory concentration = 4 microg/ml), the frequency was highest in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. we also learned that nonsusceptibility to ceftazidime in klebsiella pneumoniae was more prevalent among isolates from blood (12.7%) than among isolates from urine (7.1%) or respiratory sources (9.3%). although antimicrobial resistance is low overall for  isolates of escherichia coli from blood, the prevalence of cefoxitin resistance among ceftazidime-resistant strains (61.9%) suggests the action of mechanisms other than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase.

AB  == nosocomial bloodstream infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality. in this study, concurrent surveillance for nosocomial bloodstream infections at 49 hospitals over a 3-year period detected >10,000 infections. gram-positive organisms accounted for 64% of cases, gram-negative organisms accounted for 27%, and 8% were caused by fungi. the most common organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (32%), staphylococcus aureus (16%), and enterococci (11%). enterobacter, serratia, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and  candida were more likely to cause infections in patients in critical care units.  in patients with neutropenia, viridans streptococci were significantly more common. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common pathogens on all clinical services except obstetrics, where escherichia coli was most common. methicillin resistance was detected in 29% of s. aureus isolates and 80% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. vancomycin resistance in enterococci was species-dependent--3% of enterococcus faecalis strains and 50% of enterococcus faecium isolates displayed resistance. these data may allow clinicians to better  target empirical therapy for hospital-acquired cases of bacteremia.

TI  == comparison of the d-glutamate-adding enzymes from selected gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the biochemical properties of the d-glutamate-adding enzymes (murd) from escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus were investigated to detect any differences in the activity of this enzyme between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the genes (murd) that encode these enzymes were cloned into pmal-c2 fusion vector and overexpressed as maltose-binding protein-murd fusion proteins. each fusion protein was purified to homogeneity by affinity to amylose resin. proteolytic treatments of the fusion proteins with factor xa regenerated the individual murd  proteins. it was found that these fusion proteins retain d-glutamate-adding activity and have km and vmax values similar to those of the regenerated murds, except for the h. influenzae enzyme. substrate inhibition by udp-n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine, the acceptor substrate, was observed at concentrations greater than 15 and 30 microm for e. coli and h. influenzae murd,  respectively. such substrate inhibition was not observed with the e. faecalis and s. aureus enzymes, up to a substrate concentration of 1 to 2 mm. in addition, the two murds of gram-negative origin were shown to require monocations such as nh4+  and/or k+, but not na+, for optimal activity, while anions such as cl- and so4(2-) had no effect on the enzyme activities. the activities of the two murds of gram-positive origin, on the other hand, were not affected by any of the ions  tested. all four enzymes required mg2+ for the ligase activity and exhibited optimal activities around ph 8. these differences observed between the gram-positive and gram-negative murds indicated that the two gram-negative bacteria may apply a more stringent regulation of cell wall biosynthesis at the early stage of peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway than do the two gram-positive bacteria. therefore, the murd-catalyzed reaction may constitute a fine-tuning step necessary for the gram-negative bacteria to optimally maintain its relatively thin yet essential cell wall structure during all stages of growth.

TI  == formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  == mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. the morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did  not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. different bacterial  strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. the results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by  a surface film. the basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane.  the membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. the results of this investigation seem  to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. this type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.

AB  == an in vitro model simulating trovafloxacin concentrations in human serum after standard doses was used to investigate the activity of this drug with time against bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. antibiotic concentrations used for each incubation period  were: 4.24 mg/l (0-1 h), 3.69 mg/l (1-3 h), 3.25 mg/l (3-6 h), 2.38 mg/l (6-8 h), 1.35 mg/l (8-24 h). a 99.9% initial inoculum reduction (> 3 log10 cfu/ml) was defined as bactericidal activity. bactericidal activity against these organisms was obtained with trovafloxacin after the first hour of incubation, and similar activity was obtained against b. fragilis, e. faecalis and s. aureus after 3 h, when they were tested individually. when the strains were tested as mixed culture, there was bactericidal activity against e. coli after 1 h incubation and after 3 h for s. aureus. this activity was observed against b. fragilis and e. faecalis after 6 h incubation in the mixed culture assays and after 3 h when organisms were tested individually. regrowth was not observed over a 24 h period. these data show that trovafloxacin might be effective in intraabdominal infections caused by mixed aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.

TI  == a comparison of the antibacterial activity of levobupivacaine vs. bupivacaine: an in vitro study with bacteria implicated in epidural infection.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to compare the antibacterial activity of bupivacaine with levobupivacaine against a range of bacteria implicated in epidural infection to determine whether any differences existed between the two drugs. concentrations of 0.125%, 0.25% and 0.5% bupivacaine and levobupivacaine were inoculated with suspensions of either staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus  aureus or enterococcus faecalis. after incubation, the mixtures were plated onto  blood agar and colony counts were recorded after a further period of incubation.  the minimum bactericidal concentration of local anaesthetic against the three bacteria studied was found to be 0.25% for bupivacaine and 0.5% for levobupivacaine showing racemic bupivacaine to have a more potent antibacterial action than levobupivacaine. this finding suggests that the dextrobupivacaine isomer of racemic bupivacaine has a more potent antibacterial action than the levobupivacaine isomer.

TI  == the ex vivo antimicrobial activity and colonization rate of two antimicrobial-bonded central venous catheters.
AB  == objective: catheter-related sepsis is an important complication associated with the use of central venous catheters. recent studies have suggested that antimicrobial-bonded catheters may reduce catheter colonization and catheter-related sepsis. the aim of this study was to determine the relationship  between the antimicrobial activity and the colonization rate of two commercially  available antimicrobial-bonded central venous catheters. design: prospective, randomized, controlled, nonblinded study. setting: medical intensive care unit of a university-affiliated teaching hospital. patients: one hundred twenty consecutive medical intensive care unit patients requiring new central venous catheters (fresh stick). interventions: patients were randomized to receive a) a  standard arrow; b) an arrowgard; or c) a cook bio-guard spectrum central venous catheter. central venous catheters were removed when they were no longer required or when catheter-related sepsis was suspected. under aseptic conditions, the distal 12 cm of the removed catheters were cut into six 2-cm segments. semiquantitative culture was performed (by roll technique) on the distal segment. colonization was defined as >15 colony-forming units. using a modified kirby-bauer technique, the zone of inhibition of the remaining five segments was  determined against the following organisms: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter baumannii, and candida albicans catheters that were removed within 24 hrs of insertion were excluded from the analysis. measurements and main results: seven patients were not assessable. the baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were similar among the three groups of patients. eleven standard  arrow (28%), seven arrowgard (19%), and four bio-guard (11%) catheters were colonized (p = .05 for bio-guard vs. control). staphylococci were the most common colonizing organisms. two patients with standard arrow catheters (5%) and one patient with an arrowgard catheter (3%) developed catheter-related sepsis. antibiotic-coated catheters significantly inhibited the growth of all test organisms except c. albicans (p < or = .05). zones of inhibition were significantly larger for the bio-guard compared with the arrowgard catheter when  tested against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and e. faecalis (p < or = .002). conclusion: the bio-guard central venous catheter had greater ex vivo antimicrobial activity  against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and e. faecalis compared with the arrowgard catheter, and this was associated with a significantly lower rate of catheter colonization.

TI  == [clinical features and outcome of pneumonia in patients with lung cancer].
AB  == we reviewed our experience with pneumonia in patients with lung cancer over a 14-year period at kurume university hospital. we examined the clinical features and significance of pathogenic microbes isolated from sputum in patients with lung cancer complicated by pneumonia. many investigators have noted that patients with squamous cell lung cancer tend to contract pneumonia more readily than patients with cancers of other histopathological types. our review, however, disclosed no significant differences among histopathological types. bacteriological examinations of sputum revealed the frequent involvement of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and various gram-negative organisms (e.g., pseudomonas, acinetobacter, enterobacter, and klebsiella species) that are known to be causative agents of hospital-acquired infection. beta-lactam and cldm were less effective. carbapenem used alone as the second regimen of treatment for lung cancer patients with pneumonia was found to be as effective as combination therapy with beta-lactam and aminoglycoside. however, more detailed investigations (e.g., randomized prospective studies) will be needed to identify  suitable antibiotics against pneumonia in patients with lung cancer. we concluded that it will be necessary to evaluate the clinical features and outcome of pneumonia in lung cancer patients in order to provide more effective treatment.

AB  == antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive pathogens from 30 centres in the uk (ten teaching, ten associate teaching and ten district general hospitals) was studied over a 4 month period between october 1996 and january 1997. high-level resistance (hlr) and low-level resistance (llr) to penicillin amongst pneumococci was 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively. however, considerable variation in resistance rates was observed depending on geographical location (llr range 0-15.4% and hlr  range 0-30.8%). considerable variation in resistance rates was also observed for  staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, with rates ranging from 0% to 56.7% depending on locality. using conventional mic methodology, none of the isolates of s. aureus was considered as having reduced sensitivity to vancomycin. however, eight isolates grew on brain heart infusion agar containing vancomycin (4 mg/l) after prolonged incubation and are therefore worthy of further investigation by electron microscopy. with enterococcus faecalis, resistance rates were similar between the three types of hospital and only four isolates were considered resistant to glycopeptide antibiotics (one vana and three vanb phenotype).

TI  == pathogenesis of gram-positive bacterial endophthalmitis.
AB  == the severity of endophthalmitis has been associated generally with the virulence  of the offending pathogen. however, precisely what constitutes the virulence in intraocular infections remains ill defined. we therefore sought to identify the basis for virulence for three common ocular pathogens (bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) in terms of intraocular growth  rates, bacterial localization patterns, and the contribution of cell walls and secreted products to the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis. rabbit eyes were injected intravitreally with (i) viable b. cereus, e. faecalis, or s. aureus, (ii) metabolically inactive b. cereus, e. faecalis, or s. aureus, (iii) sacculus  preparations from each strain, or (iv) culture fluid containing products secreted by each strain. eyes were assessed at various times following injection by slit lamp biomicroscopy, electroretinography (erg), bacterial and inflammatory cell enumeration, and histology. b. cereus endophthalmitis followed a more rapid and virulent course than e. faecalis or s. aureus endophthalmitis, eliminating retinal responsiveness, as measured by erg, by 12 h. analysis of bacterial localization revealed that b. cereus uniquely migrated rapidly from posterior to  anterior segment during infection. although injection of neither metabolically inactive bacteria nor cell wall sacculi greatly affected erg, significant intraocular inflammation was observed. injection of b. cereus or s. aureus culture fluids caused both significant reductions in retinal responsiveness and significant intraocular inflammation, paralleling that seen in natural infections. the results demonstrate that toxins, intraocular localization, and, to a lesser extent, the intraocular host response to cell walls all contribute to the pathogenesis of b. cereus, s. aureus, and e. faecalis endophthalmitis in a pathogen-specific manner. the key pathophysiologic differences in these intraocular diseases highlight opportunities for optimizing conventional therapies and deriving new ones.

AB  == sch27899 is an oligosaccharide, everninomicin antibiotic with activity primarily  against gram-positive pathogens. the activity of sch27899 was evaluated against 360 routine clinical isolates by the broth microdilution (bmd), agar dilution (ad), disk diffusion (dd), and etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) methods. in addition, results from a nine center sch27899 quality control (qc) trial were used to establish qc ranges. sch27899 mics for 330 gram-positive strains, including multiply-resistant staphylococci and enterococci, ranged from 0.015 to  1 microgram/ml with mic90s of 0.12 to 0.5 microgram/ ml. sch27899 had no measurable activity against the 30 selected gram-negative strains tested (mics, > 256 micrograms/ml), with the exception of moraxella catarrhalis mics, 0.12 microgram/ ml). etest mics for sch27899 correlated well with ad and bmd results with > 90% of mics within +/- one log2 dilutions of the reference test results. three disk concentrations (2.5-, 5-, 10-microgram) of sch27899 were evaluated, but minimal difference of zone diameters between disk drug contents was observed  (+/- 2 mm). sch27899 disk zone diameters correlated poorly with reference mics due to small zone diameters (range, 11 to 22 mm) attributed to poor diffusion through agar mediums, a product of this compound's high molecular weight and solubility. the use of the dd method for sch27899 was not recommended. the proposed mic quality assurance limits for sch27899 using staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 was 0.06 to 0.25 microgram/ml for both qc strains and methods. sch27899 appears to be a eveminomicin-derivative widely active against important gram-positive cocci, and in vitro dilution testing methods would be preferred for clinical use, validated by the recommended mic control ranges cited in this report.

TI  == conjugative mobilization of the rolling-circle plasmid pip823 from listeria monocytogenes bm4293 among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == we determined the sequence and genetic organization of plasmid pip823, which contains the dfrd gene; dfrd confers high-level trimethoprim resistance to listeria monocytogenes bm4293 by synthesis of dihydrofolate reductase type s2. pip823 possessed all the features of the pub110/pc194 plasmid family, whose members replicate by the rolling-circle mechanism. the rep gene encoded a protein identical to repu, the protein required for initiation of the replication of plasmids ptb913 from a thermophilic bacillus sp. and pub110 from staphylococcus aureus. the mob gene encoded a protein with a high degree of amino acid identity  with the mob proteins involved in conjugative mobilization and interplasmidic recombination of ptb913 and pub110. the host range of pip823 was broad and included l. monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, s. aureus, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. in all these species, pip823 replicated by generating single-stranded dna and was stable. conjugative mobilization of pip823 was obtained by self-transferable plasmids between l. monocytogenes and e. faecalis,  between l. monocytogenes and e. coli, and between strains of e. coli, and by the  streptococcal conjugative transposon tn1545 from l. monocytogenes to e. faecalis, and from l. monocytogenes and e. faecalis to e. coli. these data indicate that the gene flux observed in nature from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria can occur by conjugative mobilization. our results suggest that dissemination of trimethoprim resistance in listeria spp. and acquisition of other antibiotic resistance determinants in this species can be anticipated.

AB  == objective: to assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (gpc), gram-negative  bacillary (gnb), and fungal blood-stream infections (bsis) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. study design: case series. methods: demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven bsis was analyzed. early-onset bsis were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset bsis as those that occurred thereafter. suspected early-onset bsis were treated with ampicillin and  gentamicin, and suspected late-onset bsis with vancomycin and gentamicin. antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. results: early-onset bsis were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. gpc (83% due to group b streptococcus [gbs]) accounted for approximately one half of  early-onset bsi cases and gnb (68% enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. early-onset gbs declined from 24 to 11 cases (p=.04) and late-onset bsi increased from 111 to 230 cases (p<.01) from the first to the last study period. sixty-eight percent of late-onset bsis were due to gpc (primarily coagulase-negative staphylococcus), 18% to gnb, and 14% to fungus. over the study period, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and  gentamicin. although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn bsi cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 enterococcus faecalis isolates. all fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. conclusion: we observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset bsis due to gbs and an increase in late-onset bsis due to gpc, gnb, and fungi. the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset bsis and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset bsis has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.

TI  == in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against clinical isolates of common gram-positive bacteria in taiwan.
AB  == the mics of quinupristin/dalfopristin against common gram-positive bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens at a university hospital in taiwan were  determined by the agar dilution method. the tested bacteria included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (msse), streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. with the exception of e. faecalis all bacteria were susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. the mic50 and mic90 were, respectively, 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml for both mrsa and mssa; 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml for mrse; 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.25 microgram/ml for msse; 0.125 microgram/ml and 0.125 microgram/ml for s.  pyogenes; and < or = 0.03 microgram/ml and 0.25 microgram/ml for s. pneumoniae. eighty-two percent of the tested e. faecalis isolates were intermediately resistant or resistant to quinupristin/dalfopristin, with an mic50 of 2 micrograms/ml and an mic90 of 4 micrograms/ml. quinupristin/dalfopristin seems to be a promising antimicrobial agent against common gram-positive bacteria other than e. faecalis in taiwan.

TI  == gatifloxacin (am-1155, cg 5501) susceptibility testing interpretive criteria and  quality control guidelines for dilution and disk (5-microgram) diffusion methods. the quality control study group.
AB  == gatifloxacin (formerly am-1155 and cg5501), a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, has  an expanded spectrum of activity against gram-positive cocci and some anaerobic bacteria. this compound was tested against 600 recent clinical strains of rapidly growing aerobic species to establish susceptibility testing interpretive criteria for the reference broth microdilution and standardized disk (5-microgram) diffusion methods of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). these strains included 285 enterobacteriaceae (17 species), 165 staphylococci, 49 enterococci, and 101 nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. based on achievable serum levels with projected gatifloxacin dosing regimens, mic break points of < or = 2 micrograms/ml (> or = 18 mm) for susceptibility and > or = 8 micrograms/ml (< or = 14 mm) for resistance were selected. the absolute agreement between tests was 94.3% with no very major false-resistant errors. the  quality control ranges (mic and zone diameters) for the nccls recommended strains were determined in a nine-laboratory nccls protocol as follows: escherichia coli  atcc 25922 = 0.008-0.03 microgram/ml and 31-37 mm; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 = 0.12-1 microgram/ml; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 = 0.5-2 micrograms/ml and 21-27 mm; staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 = 27-33 mm and s. aureus atcc 29213 = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml. gatifloxacin appears to be a promising new fluoroquinolone with acceptable susceptibility testing methods for  routine clinical laboratory use.

TI  == uptake kinetics of nucleic acid targeting dyes in s. aureus, e. faecalis and b. cereus: a flow cytometric study.
AB  == for flow cytometry-based detection as well as susceptibility testing and counting, staining of the bacterial cells is essential. in an attempt to develop  rapid preparatory procedures for nucleic acid staining of wild type gram positive bacteria, the uptake of fluorescent dyes in viable s. aureus, e. faecalis, and b. cereus cells was studied by flow cytometry under conditions intended to block probe efflux and increase cell wall permeability. the aim of the study was to develop procedures which allow rapid nucleic acid staining independent of fixation, since ethanol fixation is time-consuming and may mask phenomena associated with viability and lead to uncontrolled loss and aggregation of cells. the dye uptake was measured repeatedly after treating cells with metabolic inhibitors in order to block probe efflux, or cold shock (0 degree c) to increase permeability. the probes used were mithramycin (mi), ethidium bromide (eb), dapi, hoechst 33342 and hoechst 33258. none of the procedures facilitated uptake of the dyes to a level similar to that obtained in fixed control cells in all of the species. after metabolic inhibition of b. cereus cells, dapi and hoechst fluorescence increased to a level similar to or above that found in fixed cells,  indicating that the uptake of these dyes is limited by energy-dependent efflux. a similar increase of dapi fluorescence was observed after cold shock suggesting the uptake of this dye to be limited also by permeability in b. cereus. the mi and eb fluorescence increased to the level of the fixed control cells under all conditions tested, suggesting free probe influx in this species. generally, probe uptake in s. aureus and e. faecalis was lower than in b. cereus cells, and no permeabilizing effect of cold shock was observed. in some experiments the fluorescence exceeded that of ethanol fixed control cells, indicating that the fixation may cause conformational changes in dna.

TI  == antibacterial synergistic effect of chlorhexidine and hydrogen peroxide against streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == chlorhexidine (chx) and hydrogen peroxide (hp) are potent antibacterial agents that are used in controlling dental plaque. however, both agents bear undesired side-effects. we have tested the hypothesis that an antibacterial synergistic effect can occur between the two agents against streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus. we have found that at several combinations of hp and chx an antibacterial synergistic effect does occur, while  at other combinations a on-significant synergism was noticed. no antagonism between the two agents was found in our experimental system. it can be postulated that the mechanism of this synergistic effect is via alteration of the bacterial  cell-surface by chx thereby allowing for an increased amount of hp to penetrate and to react with the intercellular organelles of the bacteria. these results suggest that chx and hp can be of use in controlling the dental plaque in the oral cavity.

TI  == [a consideration on the results of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities--gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci].
AB  == the results of the semi-annual nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibilities, conducted by the japanese ministry of health and welfare during the period of january 1993 to july 1995, were analyzed for typical gram-positive  cocci and gram-negative cocci in the purpose of provision of an index for antimicrobial selection. during these 3 years, streptococcus pyogenes (group a) and streptococcus agalactiae (group b) showed slightly increasing tendency in susceptibility to ofloxacin (oflx) and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (st), while  streptococcus pneumoniae and moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis showed slightly  decreasing tendency to cefaclor (ccl). however, these annual changes were almost  negligible. generally, these microorganisms showed relatively good susceptibilities, every year, to the principal antimicrobial agents being approved for use against gram-positive and -negative cocci. however, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis showed tendencies of decreased susceptibility to some of the antimicrobial agents. on the other hand, cefmetazole (cmz), vancomycin (vcm), latamoxef (lmox), st and minocycline (mino) showed good activities against some of the gram-positive and -negative cocci to which no indication are approved. in conclusion, beside the identification of the causative microorganisms and the performance of antimicrobial susceptibility testing, such analyses (graphics of susceptibility tendency of clinical isolates to variety of antimicrobial agents)  could be used as an index for selection of antimicrobial agents, when emergent and urgent selection of an antimicrobial agent is necessary.

TI  == coenzyme a-disulfide reductase from staphylococcus aureus: evidence for asymmetric behavior on interaction with pyridine nucleotides.
AB  == an unusual flavoprotein disulfide reductase, which catalyzes the nadph-dependent  reduction of coasscoa, has recently been purified from the human pathogen staphylococcus aureus [delcardayre, s. b., stock, k. p., newton, g. l., fahey, r. c., and davies, j. e. (1998) j. biol. chem. 273, 5744-5751]. coenzyme a-disulfide reductase (coadr) lacks the redox-active protein disulfide characteristic of the  disulfide reductases; instead, nadph reduction yields 1 protein-sh and 1 coash. furthermore, the coadr sequence reveals the presence of a single putative active-site cys (cys43) within an sfxxc motif also seen in the enterococcus faecalis nadh oxidase and nadh peroxidase, which use a single redox-active cysteine-sulfenic acid in catalysis. in this report, we provide a detailed examination of the equilibrium properties of both wild-type and c43s coadrs, focusing on the role of cys43 in the catalytic redox cycle, the behavior of both  enzyme forms on reduction with dithionite and nadph, and the interaction of nadp+ with the corresponding reduced enzyme species. the results of these analyses, combined with electrospray mass spectrometric data for the two oxidized enzyme forms, fully support the catalytic redox role proposed for cys43 and confirm that this is the attachment site for bound coash. in addition, we provide evidence indicating dramatic thermodynamic inequivalence between the two active sites per  dimer, similar to that documented for the related enzymes mercuric reductase and  nadh oxidase; only 1 fad is reduced with nadph in wild-type coadr. the eh2.nadph/eh4.nadp+ complex which results is reoxidized quantitatively in titrations with coasscoa, supporting a possible role for the asymmetric reduced dimer in catalysis.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == a sensitive and quick microplate method to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration of plant extracts for bacteria.

AB  == gatifloxacin (formerly am-115) is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum against gram-positive cocci and some anaerobes. to assess this  new agent's activity, a collection of 1,676 gram-positive cocci were selected for resistance to ciprofloxacin (> or = 4 micrograms/ml) and tested against gatifloxacin and 18 other compounds by reference broth microdilution methods. the strains (approximately 23,000 total isolates from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program) were from significant blood stream, respiratory tract, wound, and urinary tract infections in patients in north (38 hospitals) and south (10 hospitals) america. against enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, gatifloxacin inhibited only 16% and 10% of strains compared with 12% and 5% for recently released trovafloxacin, respectively. among staphylococcus aureus (90% oxacillin-resistant) strains, gatifloxacin was more active (67% susceptible at <  or = 4 micrograms/ml) than trovafloxacin (59%) or sparfloxacin (4%). gatifloxacin had a wider spectrum than trovafloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci  especially s. epidermidis, 2% versus 58% resistance. the glycopeptides, chloramphenicol and rifampin were most active. against all genus/species groups with more than 100 sample strains (1,566), high-level resistance to gatifloxacin  and trovafloxacin (> 4 micrograms/ml) was not significantly different (41.7% versus 39.1%; p > 0.05). emerging resistance to the fluoroquinolones remains a clinical problem among gram-positive species, and gatifloxacin seems to be active in vitro against many of these contemporary strains isolated in the americas.

TI  == isolation and characterization of enterocin ej97, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus faecalis ej97.
AB  == the bacteriocinogenic strain of enterococcus faecalis ej97 has been isolated from municipal waste water. it produces a cationic bacteriocin (enterocin ej97) of low molecular mass (5,340 da) that is very stable under mild heat conditions and is sensitive to proteolytic enzymes. the amino acid sequence of the first 18 n-terminal residues of enterocin ej97 indicates that it is different from other known protein sequences. enterocin ej97 is active on several gram-positive bacteria including enterococci, several species of bacillus, listeria, and staphylococcus aureus. the producer strain is immune to bacteriocin. enterocin ej97 has a concentration-dependent bactericidal and bacteriolytic effect on e. faecalis s-47.

TI  == detection of a streptomycin/spectinomycin adenylyltransferase gene (aada) in enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == genes encoding streptomycin/spectinomycin adenylyltransferases [ant(3")(9)] have  been reported to exist in gram-negative organisms and staphylococcus aureus. during a study of high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci, we encountered an isolate of enterococcus faecalis that was streptomycin resistant but did not appear to contain the 6'-adenylyltransferase gene (aade) when examined by pcr with specific primers. phosphocellulose paper binding assays indicated the presence of an ant(3")(9) enzyme. streptomycin and spectinomycin mics of 4,000 and 8,000 microg/ml, respectively, were observed for the isolate. pcr primers corresponding to a highly conserved region of the aada gene were used to amplify a specific 284-bp product. the product hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled pcr product from e. coli c600(php45omega) known to contain the aada gene. the aada gene was transferred via filter matings from the e. faecalis donor to e. faecalis jh2-2. pcr primers designed for analysis of integrons were used to amplify a 1-kb product containing the aada gene, which was cloned into the vector pcrii and transformed into escherichia coli dh5-alpha competent cells. d-rhodamine dye terminator cycle sequencing was used to determine the gene sequence, which was compared to previously reported sequences  of aada genes. we found the aada gene in e. faecalis to be identical to the aada  genes reported by sundstr om et al. for e. coli plasmid r6-5 (l. sundstrom, p. radstrom, g. swedberg, and o. skold, mol. gen. genet. 213:191-201, 1988), by fling et al. for the aada within transposon tn7 (m. e. fling, j. kopf, and c. richards, nucleic acids res. 13:7095-7106, 1985), and by hollingshead and vapnek  for e. coli r538-1 (s. hollingshead and d. vapnek, plasmid 13:17-30, 1985). previous reports of the presence of the aada gene in enterococci appear to be erroneous and probably describe an aade gene, since the isolates were reported to be susceptible to spectinomycin.

TI  == the effects of ultraviolet radiation on antibiotic-resistant bacteria in vitro.
AB  == wound infections produced by antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains are particularly difficult to manage. this study examined the effectiveness of ultraviolet (uv) light treatment in killing antibiotic-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis in vitro. between 2 and 5 replications of each organism at 10(8) organisms/ml were prepared and plated on sheep blood agar medium and treated with uv light (254 nm, 15.54 mw/cm2 output).  irradiation times were 0, 2, 5, 8, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 or 120 seconds. bacterial cultures were then incubated at 35 degrees c for 24 hours. kill rates were 99.9 percent for the methicillin-resistant strain of s. aureus (mrsa) at 5, 8, 15, 30, 45, 60 seconds and 100 percent at 90 and 120 seconds. kill rates were 99.9 percent at 5, 8, 15, 30 seconds for vancomycin-resistant e. faecalis (vre) and 100 percent at 45, 60, 90, 120 seconds. similar results were found with uv light  treatment of the antibiotic-susceptible strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis. a significant difference in kill rates at 30 seconds of uv exposure was detected between the antibiotic-resistant strain of s. aureus and the antibiotic-resistant strain of e. faecalis (student's t test, p < 0.01). significant differences were  also detected in the kill rates at 30 second exposure times for the antibiotic-susceptible strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis. these findings suggest that the enterococcal bacteria is more susceptible to the killing effects of uv. this data also suggests that uv light at 254 nm is bactericidal for antibiotic-resistant strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis at times as short as 5  seconds and that the enterococcal bacteria is more susceptible to the killing effects of uv. with recommended patient treatment times for infected wounds being significantly longer than 5 seconds, this data indicates that patient treatment times need to be re-examined.

TI  == infective endocarditis in the premature neonate.
AB  == we describe a series of 11 high-risk neonates with infective endocarditis (ie) in this retrospective review. previously ie has rarely been diagnosed in newborns and is usually fatal. the frequency was 4.3 cases per 100 patients. five patients survived. microorganisms included gram positives such as s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, gram negatives such as klebsiella pneumoniae,  enterobacter cloacae, enterococcus faecalis, serratia marcescens, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. echocardiographic location of the lesions showed four left sided, five right sided, and two bilateral. we conclude that ie may be  more common than previously described. prompt diagnosis and treatment led to survival in 45% of our patients. prospective studies are needed to identify patients at risk and to establish the true incidence of ie in high-risk neonates.

TI  == the preliminary isolation of several antibacterial compounds from combretum erythrophyllum (combretaceae).
AB  == freeze dried ground leaves of combretum erythrophyllum were extracted with different extractants to determine if they contain inhibitors of pathogenic bacteria. acetone yielded the most compounds inhibiting the growth of staphylococcus aureus using bioautography of thin layer chromatography plates. acetone also extracted many different compounds and group separation was attempted by solid phase extraction on reverse and normal phase silica gel. both  techniques separated the bioactive components to a degree. the best group separation results, however, were obtained using liquid/liquid extraction. the six fractions obtained inhibited the four test organisms to different degrees. s. aureus was the most sensitive (100%) followed by enterococcus faecalis (36%), escherichia coli (11%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (3%). with s. aureus as test organism, the chloroform soluble fraction contained by far the largest quantity of inhibiting components (100%), followed by the fractions soluble in water (23%), 35% methanol in water (18%), butanol (5%), carbon tetrachloride (2%) and hexane (traces). the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration for s. aureus was 0.05 mg/ml at this stage of purification compared to mic values of 0.08 and 0.16  mg/ml for ampicillin and chloramphenicol. there were at least 14 different inhibitors with a wide range of polarities present in the different fractions. the polar components apparently did not contain polysaccharides and were probably basic according to the chromatographic behaviour.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of opc-20011, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum 2-oxaisocephem antibiotic.
AB  == opc-20011, a new parenteral 2-oxaisocephem antibiotic, has an oxygen atom at the  2- position of the cephalosporin frame. opc-20011 had the best antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae: mics at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were 6.25, 6.25, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively. its activity is due to a high affinity of the penicillin-binding protein 2' in mrsa, an affinity which was approximately 1,050 times as high as that for flomoxef. against gram-negative bacteria, opc-20011 also showed antibacterial activities similar to those of ceftazidime. the in vivo activities of opc-20011 were comparable to or greater than those of reference compounds in murine models of systemic infection caused by gram-positive and -negative pathogens. opc-20011 was up to 10 times as effective as vancomycin against mrsa infections in mice. this better in vivo efficacy is probably due to the bactericidal activity of opc-20011, while vancomycin showed bacteriostatic activity against mrsa. opc-20011 produced a significant decrease of viable counts in lung tissue at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg of body weight, an efficacy similar to that of ampicillin at a dose of 10 to 20 mg/kg on an experimental murine model of respiratory tract infection caused by non-ampicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae t-0005. the better therapeutic efficacy  of opc-20011 was considered to be due to its potent antibacterial activity and low affinity for serum proteins of experimental animals (29% in mice and 6.4% in  rats).

TI  == in vitro susceptibility testing and quality control parameters for sarafloxacin (a-56620): a fluoroquinolone used for treatment and control of colibacillosis in  poultry. quality control study group.
AB  == sarafloxacin (formerly a-56620) is a fluoroquinolone recently introduced into veterinary practice for the therapy of colibacillosis and other indicated infections. sarafloxacin was noted to be very active and comparable to ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin for inhibiting 823 strains from a wide variety of  species at < or = 1 or < or = 2 micrograms/ml. in vitro susceptibility tests for  sarafloxacin using national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) methods were also studied and interpretive criteria for escherichia coli-associated colibacillosis isolates were proposed: susceptible at < or = 0.06 microgram/ml (> or = 25 mm) and resistant at > or = 0.25 microgram/ml (< or = 21  mm). sarafloxacin agar dilution mic results were approximately one log2 dilution  higher than broth microdilution endpoints. the interpretive criteria demonstrated a low error rate of 5.9%, with a very major rate of only 0.5% (correlation coefficient between methods = 0.94). quality control trials in six laboratories established mic and zone diameter (5-microgram disk) limits for the nccls recommended strains: for the broth microdilution test, e. coli atcc 25922 = 0.008 to 0.03 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 = 0.12 to 1 microgram/ml, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 = 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 = 0.06 to 0.25 microgram/ml; and for the disk diffusion test, e. coli atcc 25922 = 30 to 36 mm, s. aureus atcc 25923 = 25 to 30 mm, and p. aeruginosa atcc 27853 = 23 to 29 mm. these criteria for in vitro tests with sarafloxacin should enable the longitudinal monitoring of its activity against the indicated pathogens and allow detection of emerging resistant populations that may necessitate altered dosing regimens.

TI  == in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam relative to other antibiotics against blood culture isolates.
AB  == resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is an increasing problem in many countries. accurate locally relevant information is essential for detection and control of emerging resistance and to facilitate choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in the immediate management of seriously ill patients. we have determined the minimum inhibitory concentration of piperacillin/tazobactam for 97 strains of bacteria (55 enterobacteriaceae, 13 non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, 22 staphylococcus aureus, 6 enterococcus faecalis and 1 bacillus cereus) isolated from blood cultures and compared its activity to that of amoxycillin, co-amoxiclav, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin, cefotaxime. the strains were consecutive non-fastidious isolates with the following qualifications: coagulase negative staphylococci and diphtheroids were excluded and the number of staphylococcus aureus isolates was limited to 12 methicillin-resistant and 10 methicillin-sensitive strains. multiple isolates of the same species from individual patients were not included. the minimum inhibition concentrations of methicillin, penicillin, teichoplanin and vancomycin were also determined for specific groups of organisms. mics were determined by the etest method (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) on mueller hinton agar. the mics of appropriate american type culture collection control strains were determined. based on the interpretative criteria of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (usa), 87 per cent of gram-negative bacilli were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam compared with amoxycillin 26 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, co-amoxiclav 54 per cent, piperacillin 56 per cent, cefotaxime 69 per cent, ceftazidime 84 per cent, gentamicin 85 per cent and ciprofloxacin 91 per cent. of all isolates 75 per cent were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, compared with amoxycillin 22 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, piperacillin 41 per cent, co-amoxiclav 52 per cent, cefotaxime 59 per cent, ceftazidime 60 per cent, gentamicin 74 per cent and ciprofloxacin 77 per cent. two isolates (1 e. coli and 1 klebsiella pneumoniae) with antibiograms consistent with the relatively new resistance phenomenon of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production were identified. the spectrum of activity of piperacillin-tazobactam for empirical antibiotic therapy is significantly greater than that of piperacillin alone and is similar to that of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin.

TI  == toxicity of hydrogen peroxide produced by electroplated coatings to pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the ability of various electroplated coatings (cobalt, zinc, copper, and cobalt-containing alloys of nickel, zinc, chromium, etc.) to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria (gram-positive bacteria enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae) was determined by a drop-method antibacterial experiment. the amounts of h2o2 produced and metal ions dissolved from the surfaces of various electroplated coatings were measured and it was found that the inhibitory ability of coatings corresponded to the amounts of h2o2 produced. the more significant the inhibition of the coating to bacterial growth, the greater the amount of h2o2 production. in addition, the bacterial survival rates on the surfaces of coatings were almost zero when h2o2 was produced in amounts greater than 10(-6) mmol/cm2. however, the dominant concentrations of metal ions dissolved from coatings were outside of the bacterial lethal range.

TI  == bacteriology of burns.
AB  == a retrospective study was undertaken at university college of medical sciences and guru teg bahadur hospital, delhi, to examine the bacterial isolates from the  burns unit and to determine the antibiograms of the isolates to commonly used antimicrobial agents. a total of 600 pus samples from as many patients received,  over a period of 5 years (june 1993-june 1997) yielded 920) isolates. pseudomonas spp. was the most common (36%) followed by staphylococcus aureus (19%), klebsiella spp. (15.54%), proteus spp. (11.19%), enterococcus faecalis (8.5%), escherichia coli (5.10%), acinetobacter spp. (1.1%), salmonella senftenberg (0.8%) and other (3%). pseudomonas spp. was the most susceptible to ceftazidime (83% susceptible) and cefoperazone (82% susceptible), whereas the drugs most effective in other gram-negative organisms were amikacin, netilmicin and ciproflox. vancomycin was effective in 100% of gram-positive organisms. the infection of burn wounds with multiple organisms, with the superadded problem of  drug resistance, necessitate the institution of a drug policy by the hospitals for burn patients.

TI  == substituted salicylanilides as inhibitors of two-component regulatory systems in  bacteria.
AB  == a new class of inhibitors of the two-component regulatory systems (tcs) of bacteria was discovered based on the salicylanilide screening hits, closantel (1) and tetrachlorosalicylanilide (9). a systematic sar study versus a model tcs, kina/spo0f, demonstrated the importance of electron-attracting substituents in the salicyloyl ring and hydrophobic groups in the anilide moiety for optimal activity. in addition, derivatives 8 and 16, containing the 2, 3-dihydroxybenzanilide structural motif, were potent inhibitors of the autophosphorylation of the kina kinase, with ic50s of 2.8 and 6. 3 &microm, respectively. compound 8 also inhibited the tcs mediating vancomycin resistance (vans/vanr) in a genetically engineered enterococcus faecalis cell line at concentrations subinhibitory for growth. closantel (1), tetrachlorosalicylanilide (9), and several related derivatives (2, 7, 10, 11, 20) had antibacterial activity against the drug-resistant organisms, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref).

TI  == urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  == twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of mics. the volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. the mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, n-demethyl-fleroxacin, and n-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the  total dose, respectively. the total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. in the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (ubt) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. with most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in cfu of 99.9% (3 log units). overall, there was a good correlation between ubts and mics for the strains. against escherichia coli atcc  25922 the median ubts were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the e. coli strain for which the mic was 0.5 microgram/ml the ubt was  at least 1:4 for 48 h. the ubts of both drugs against klebsiella pneumoniae were  at least 1:16 for 72 h. the ubts for staphylococcus aureus (the mic for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. ubts for proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the median ubts were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. the same is true for enterococcus faecalis. against staphylococcus saprophyticus, ubts were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of  fleroxacin exhibits ubts comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. therefore,  it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin (rp 59500, synercid) tested against over 28,000 recent clinical isolates from 200 medical centers in the united states and canada.
AB  == a total of 200 medical center laboratories in the usa and canada contributed results of testing quinupristin-dalfopristin, a streptogramin combination (formerly rp 59500 or synercid), against 28,029 gram-positive cocci. standardized tests [disk diffusion, broth microdilution, etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden)] were utilized and validated by concurrent quality control tests. remarkable agreement was obtained between test method results for characterizing the collection by the important emerging resistances: 1) oxacillin resistance among staphylococcus aureus (41.0 to 43.7%); 2) vancomycin resistance among enterococcus faecium (50.0 to 52.0%); and 3) the penicillin nonsusceptible rate for pneumococci (31.1% overall, with 10.6% at mics of > or = 2 micrograms/ml). the quinupristin-dalfopristin mic90 for oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant s. aureus was 0.5 microgram/ml and 1 microgram/ml, respectively. the quinupristin-dalfopristin mic90 for vancomycin-resistant e. faecium was 1 microgram/ml, and only 0.2% of isolates were resistant. other enterococcus species were generally not susceptible to the streptogramin combination but were  usually inhibited by ampicillin (86 to 97% susceptible; mic50, 1.0 microgram/ml)  or vancomycin (86 to 95%; mic50, 1.0 microgram/ml). among all tested enterococci, the rate of vancomycin resistance was 16.2%. the quinupristin-dalfopristin mic90  (0.75 microgram/ml) for 4,626 tested streptococcus pneumoniae strains was not influenced by the penicillin or macrolide susceptibility patterns. when five regions in the usa and canada were analyzed for significant streptogramin and other antimicrobial spectrum differences, only the farwest region had lower numbers of streptogramin-susceptible e. faecium. canadian strains were generally  more susceptible to all drugs except chloramphenicol and doxycycline when tested  against e. faecalis (73% and 89% susceptible, respectively). the u.s. southeast region had s. pneumoniae strains less susceptible to macrolides (73%) but had more susceptibility among e. faecium isolates tested against vancomycin and ampicillin. the northeast region of the usa had the greatest rate of vancomycin resistance among enterococci. strains retested by the monitor because of quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance (mics, > or = 4 micrograms/ml) were generally not confirmed (2.2% validation), and only 0.2% of e. faecium isolates were identified as truly resistant. the most common errors were: 1) species misidentification (28.0%); 2) incorrect susceptibility results (65.6%); and 3) mixed cultures (4.3%) tested by participants. overall, quinupristin-dalfopristin  was consistently active (> or = 90% susceptible) against major gram-positive pathogens in north america, regardless of resistance patterns to other drug classes and geographic location of their isolation.

TI  == etiology and risk factors of 180 cases of native valve endocarditis. report from  a 5-year national prospective survey in slovak republic.
AB  == risk factors, etiology, and outcome of 180 cases of infective endocarditis (ie) in the slovak republic for 5 years were prospectively studied in a national survey. according to the duke endocarditis service criteria (1994), 169 cases were considered definitive and 21 possible/probable. the aortic valve was infected in 46.7%, mitral in 47.2%, and tricuspidal/pulmonary in 6.1% of cases. the majority of endocarditis cases was caused by staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (33.3%); only 12.2% were due to viridans streptococci; 11.7% were due to enterococcus faecalis; 6.1% due to haemophilus spp.; 10.1% due to other organisms; and 26.7% were culture negative. single positive cultures of cns were not considered clinically significant. more than 25% of 180 patients were older than 60 years. rheumatic fever was a risk factor in 35.5%, dental surgery in 20.5%, prior cardiosurgery in 7.8%, and neoplasia in  6.7%. all patients were treated with antimicrobials (average length of therapy was 29.5 days) and 33.3% of patients also had surgery (valvular prosthesis replacement). forty (22.2%) died, and 140 (77.8%) survived at day 60 after the diagnosis of endocarditis was made. all 40 deaths were attributable to infection. univariate analysis comparing deaths and survivors did not show significant differences in most of the recorded risk factors between both groups, except age  > 60 (40.0% versus 21.4%, p < 0.05), staphylococcal etiology (55.0% versus 27.1%, p < 0.04), and antibiotic therapy < 21 days (without surgery) (65.0% versus 3.6%, p < 0.01). these risk factors were significantly more frequently associated with  deaths. viridans streptococcal ie and surgical therapy in addition to antibiotics were associated with lower mortality in comparison to staphylococcal endocarditis (p < 0.045) or to cases treated with antibiotics only (p < 0.05). in comparison to other nationally based surveys in europe (greece, croatia, france), the percentage of culture-negative endocarditis and spectrum of pathogens differed significantly.

TI  == novel antibiotic susceptibility tests by the atp-bioluminescence method using filamentous cell treatment.
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility testing by the atp-bioluminescence method has been noted for its speed; it provides susceptibility results within 2 to 5 h. however, several disagreements between the atp method and standard methodology have been reported. the present paper describes a novel atp method in a 3.5-h test which overcomes these deficiencies through the elimination of false-resistance discrepancies in tests on gram-negative bacteria with beta-lactam agents. in our  test model using pseudomonas aeruginosa and piperacillin, it was shown that atp in filamentous cells accounted for the false resistance. we found that 0.5% 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol (ampd) extracted atp from the filamentous cells  without affecting normal cells and that 0.3 u of adenosine phosphate deaminase (apdase)/ml simultaneously digested the extracted atp. we used the mixture of these reagents for the pretreatment of cells in a procedure we named filamentous  cell treatment, prior to atp measurements. this novel atp method with the filamentous cell treatment eliminated false-resistance discrepancies in tests on  p. aeruginosa with beta-lactam agents, including piperacillin, cefoperazone, aztreonam, imipenem-cilastatin, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. furthermore, this novel methodology produced results which agreed with those of the standard microdilution method in other tests on gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria,  including p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis, for non-beta-lactam agents, such as fosfomycin, ofloxacin, minocycline, and aminoglycosides. mics obtained by the novel atp method were also in agreement with those obtained by the agar dilution method of susceptibility testing. from these results, it was shown that the novel atp method could be used successfully to test the activities of antimicrobial agents with the elimination  of the previously reported discrepancies.

TI  == a new ketolide, hmr 3004, active against streptococci inducibly resistant to erythromycin.
AB  == hmr 3004 is a new hydrazono ketolide characterized by a 3-keto function instead of the cladinose moiety. the effect of this antimicrobial agent on inducible and  constitutive macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin b (mlsb) resistance was tested in a lacz reporter system under control of several ermam-like attenuator variants. for one constitutively resistant streptococcus agalactiae strain, three inducibly resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, and one inducibly resistant enterococcus faecalis strain, the attenuators fused with lacz were cloned into the shuttle plasmid pjim2246 and the plasmid was introduced into staphylococcus aureus rn4220. for the wild-type attenuators, hmr 3004 was a very weak inducer, unlike its cladinose counterpart ru 6652 and erythromycin. as expected, for the fusion originating from the constitutively resistant s. agalactiae strain, the level of uninduced beta-galactosidase synthesis was high. for one s. pneumoniae attenuator, mutations in the 3' end of the attenuator that weakened the stem-loop structure that sequesters the ribosome-binding site and start codon for ermam methylase could explain the high level of uninduced beta-galactosidase produced.  for streptococci, the activity of hmr 3004 correlated with the basal level of beta-galactosidase synthesized. the weak inducer activity of hmr 3004 explained its activity against inducibly mlsb-resistant s. pneumoniae but did not correlate with the moderate activity of the antibiotic against inducibly resistant e. faecalis.

TI  == characterization of staphylococci with reduced susceptibilities to vancomycin and other glycopeptides.
AB  == during the last several years a series of staphylococcal isolates that demonstrated reduced susceptibility to vancomycin or other glycopeptides have been reported. we selected 12 isolates of staphylococci for which the vancomycin  mics were > or =4 microg/ml or for which the teicoplanin mics were > or =8 microg/ml and 24 control strains for which the vancomycin mics were < or =2 microg/ml or for which the teicoplanin mics were < or =4 microg/ml to determine the ability of commercial susceptibility testing procedures and vancomycin agar screening methods to detect isolates with reduced glycopeptide susceptibility. by pcr analysis, none of the isolates with decreased glycopeptide susceptibility contained known vancomycin resistance genes. broth microdilution tests held a full 24 h were best at detecting strains with reduced glycopeptide susceptibility. disk diffusion did not differentiate the strains inhibited by 8 microg of vancomycin per ml from more susceptible isolates. most of the isolates  with reduced glycopeptide susceptibility were recognized by microscan conventional panels and etest vancomycin strips. sensititre panels read visually  were more variable, although with some of the panels mics of 8 microg/ml were noted for these isolates. vitek results were 4 microg/ml for all strains for which the vancomycin mics were > or =4 microg/ml. vancomycin mics on rapid microscan panels were not predictive, giving mics of either < or =2 or > or =16 microg/ml for these isolates. commercial brain heart infusion vancomycin agar screening plates containing 6 microg of vancomycin per ml consistently differentiated those strains inhibited by 8 microg/ml from more susceptible strains. vancomycin-containing media prepared in-house showed occasional growth of susceptible strains, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, and on occasion, enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212. thus, strains of staphylococci with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides, such as vancomycin, are best detected in the laboratory by nonautomated quantitative tests incubated for a full 24 h. furthermore, it appears that commercial vancomycin agar screening plates can be used to detect these isolates.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus coenzyme a disulfide reductase, a new subfamily of pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase. sequence, expression, and analysis of cdr.
AB  == the cdr gene encoding coenzyme a disulfide reductase (coadr) from staphylococcus  aureus 8325-4 was cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed. the gene encodes a 438-amino acid polypeptide that has a calculated molecular weight of 49,200 and sequence similarity to the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family of flavoenzymes. the deduced primary structure contains consensus sequences for flavin adenine dinucleotide and nadph-binding regions but lacks the catalytic disulfide signature sequence typical of the glutathione reductase family of disulfide reductases. the active site region of coadr has only a single cysteine  residue that is similar to that in the conserved sfxxc active site motif of nadh  oxidase and nadh peroxidase from enterococcus faecalis. coadr is the first disulfide reductase reported having this active site region, and sequence comparisons of coadr to representative members of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide reductase superfamily placed coadr in a distinct subfamily.  coadr was overexpressed in escherichia coli using the pet expression system, and  5-10 mg of fully active recombinant enzyme were recovered per liter of e. coli cells.

AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. the in-vitro and in-vivo activities of cfc-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. against gram-positive bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, cfc-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to  sparfloxacin. against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of cfc-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. however, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. in mouse systemic infection caused by s. aureus smith or s. aureus tms 33, cfc-222 demonstrated an activity similar  to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. the compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by streptococcus pyogenes atcc 8668. against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. the activity of cfc-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against p. aeruginosa mb4-16 in the same infection model. these results suggest that cfc-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.

AB  == the pharmacodynamic properties of a novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide), hmr 3647, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect (pae). the time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and bacteroides fragilis. the paes of hmr 3647 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x mic. the time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that hmr 3647 is predominantly bacteriostatic and only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. hmr 3647 exhibited a significant pae with all strains studied, ranging from 1.2 h to 8.2 h at 10 x mic. the bacteriostatic activity and significant pae demonstrated by hmr 3647 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.

TI  == role of chemotherapeutic antagonism in opportunistic infections.
AB  == the most widely-known anti-tumor drugs often induce marked immunosuppression which can give rise to one or more sepses. anti-infection measures immediately applied can sometimes prove largely ineffective or even useless, the patient dying not as a result of the spread of the tumour but as a direct consequence of  opportunistic infection. we postulate that antagonism between anti-tumour and antimicrobial drugs may also play an important part in this. by way of illustration of this hypothesis, we have studied the action of a number of known  inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis and of dna-gyrases on certain strains of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms cultured in medium containing various concentrations of some of the best-known anti-tumour antimetabolites. the experimental data show that antimicrobial and anti-tumour drugs can sometimes induce synergic or indifferent chemotherapeutic interactions with many bacteria,  while in others the effect is antagonistic. in practice, the action of the drugs  could lead to bacterial selectivity, which, in conjunction with immunosuppression and the presence of resistant strains, could favour the evolution of opportunistic infection.

TI  == why does staphylococcus aureus secrete an enterococcus faecalis-specific pheromone?
AB  == the long known fact that staphylococcus aureus can secrete a peptide (staph-cam373) which acts as a sex pheromone for strains of e. faecalis carrying  the sex pheromone plasmid pam373 was studied in detail. 85 of 100 independent isolates of s. aureus produced an activity inducing the pam373 encoded adhesin resulting in a clumping reaction of e. faecalis (i.e. secreted staph-cam373), but not a single one of 100 independent isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci  possessed this activity. the production of peptides acting as sex pheromone for e. faecalis was observed only for sex pheromone plasmid pam373, but not for sex pheromone plasmids pad1 and ppd1. it was shown that the amount of staph-pam373 produced during growth paralleled cell mass, therefore this peptide should not be used as a cell density indicator by s. aureus (i.e. has no quorum sensing function). the potential function of staph-cam373 to trigger gene transfer from escherichia faecalis to s. aureus is discussed.

TI  == glycerol monolaurate inhibits induction of vancomycin resistance in enterococcus  faecalis.
AB  == glycerol monolaurate (gml) is a surfactant that has been found to inhibit the post-exponential phase activation of virulence factor production and the induction of beta-lactamase in staphylococcus aureus. it has been suggested that  signal transduction is the most probable target for gml (s. j. projan, s. brown-skrobot, p. m. schlievert, f. vandenesch, and r. p. novick, j. bacteriol. 176:4204-4209, 1994). we found that gml suppresses growth of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis on plates with vancomycin and blocks the induction of vancomycin resistance, which involves a membrane-associated signal transduction mechanism, either at or before initiation of transcription. given the surfactant  nature of gml and the results of previous experiments, we suggest that gml blocks signal transduction. in contrast, gml has no effect on the induction of erythromycin-inducible macrolide resistance in s. aureus, which does not involve  signal transduction.

AB  == rp 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. the components of rp 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of rp 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci. rp 59,500 was active against a wide range of gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. the mics90 of rp 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant s. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. rp 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus agalactiae and moraxella catarrhalis. rp 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and enterococcus avium strains which  are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. no cross-resistance was observed between rp 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. the effect of human serum on the mic of rp 59,500 was studied with strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the presence of 20% (v/v) serum had little or no effect on the mic, although 50% (v/v) serum increased mics by 4-8 folds. laboratory-induced resistance to rp 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. population analysis was performed on rp 59,500 and the reference macrolides against s. aureus atcc 25,923 strain. although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with em, cam, azm and rxm, no rp 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

AB  == the sequence of a 1955-bp taqi dna fragment from myxococcus xanthus was determined. this fragment contains two complete genes, designated prta and prtb.  the prta and prtb orfs extend over 828 and 798 bp, respectively. they are separated only by 3 nt and appear to be present in a polycistronic transcriptional unit. a typical lipoprotein signal sequence is present at the n terminus of the two deduced polypeptides. the aa sequence of prta shows a high degree of identity to the region adjacent to the ser residue belonging to the catalytic triad of serine proteases from staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. it also exhibits features characteristic of trypsin-like serine proteases in that it contains the same pattern of variable and conserved regions. the deduced aa sequence of prtb reveals a signature zinc-binding consensus motif  (hexxhxxgxxh/met-turn) characteristic of the class of metalloproteases called metzincins. plasmids containing prta, prtb, or both were constructed. protease activity studies of escherichia coli clones containing these plasmids showed that both genes are necessary for this activity, whatever their cis or trans position. as prtb produces a putative membrane-bound lipoprotein of 266 aa, the protease activation must occur at the membrane level.

AB  == new pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. these fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). variations at the c-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. the activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the c-8 substituent was in the order f (c5-nh2) > f (c5-h) > naphthyridine > cl = ome = h against gram-positive organisms. in the case of gram-negative strains, activity was in the order f (c5-nh2) > naphthyridine = f (c5-h) > h > cl > ome. the advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. in addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. among these compounds, compound 20 (lb20304) showed the best in vivo  efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. the mics (microgram/ml) of lb20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: s. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), streptococcus epidermidis 887e (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant s. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912e (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), escherichia coli 3190y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), enterobacter cloacae p99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). on the basis of these promising results, lb20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.

TI  == cloning of the staphylococcus aureus ddh gene encoding nad+-dependent d-lactate dehydrogenase and insertional inactivation in a glycopeptide-resistant isolate.
AB  == the mechanism of low-level glycopeptide resistance among staphylococci is not known. a cytoplasmic protein, provisionally called ddh (w. m. milewski, s. boyle-vavra, b. moreira, c. c. ebert, and r. s. daum, antimicrob. agents chemother. 40:166-172, 1996), and the rna transcript that contains the ddh gene,  which encodes ddh, are present in increased amounts in a vancomycin-resistant isolate, 523k, compared with the susceptible parent isolate, 523. sequence analysis had previously revealed that ddh is related to nad+-dependent d-lactate  dehydrogenase (d-nldh) and vanh. this latter protein is essential for high-level  glycopeptide resistance in enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis by synthesizing the d-lactate needed for biosynthesis of d-lactate-terminating peptidoglycan precursors with low affinity for vancomycin. we now provide the direct evidence that the ddh gene product is staphylococcus aureus d-nldh and hereafter refer to the protein as d-nldh. however, overproduction of this protein in isolate 523k did not result in production of d-lactate-containing peptidoglycan precursors, and susceptibility testing of ddh mutants of 523k demonstrated that s. aureus d-nldh is not necessary for glycopeptide resistance in this isolate. we conclude that the mechanism of glycopeptide resistance in this isolate is distinct from that in enterococci.

TI  == [an epidemiological investigation for gram-positive coccus, especially mrsa, in kinki area].
AB  == an epidemiological investigation for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  (mrsa) was performed at 21 medical institutes in kinki area by the questionnaire  from kinki infection working group in 1995. the most frequent specimen for mrsa was pus (25.3%) from out-patients and sputum (34.4%) from in-patients, respectively. as compared to the investigation of the mrsa forum in 1992 and 1993, mrsa increased over 20%, and furthermore 57.8% was mrsa out of s. aureus under this study. it demonstrated that drug-resistance was accelerated for a few  years. polymicrobial infection, especially with more than 3 pathogens, increased  significantly compared with the results of the mrsa forum (p < 0.01). it was suggested that compromized host increased and therapy turned to be more difficult. simultaneous pathogens detected with mrsa were candida species, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. in terms of chemosusceptibility, vcm (99.9%), st (99.4%) and abk (99.3%) were still determined to be highly sensitivity against mrsa.

TI  == in-vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract infections.
AB  == trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were equally active against moraxella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, legionella pneumophila, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens. ciprofloxacin was the most active compound against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90  = 1 mg/l), followed by trovafloxacin (mic90 = 4 mg/l). trovafloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin against streptococcus pyogenes (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l), streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l) and staphylococcus aureus (mic90 = 0.06 mg/l) (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, for which the mic90 was 8 mg/l). trovafloxacin was the most active compound against enterococcus faecalis: 80% of strains were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l. there was complete cross-resistance between all fluoroquinolones.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial efficacies of cfc-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == cfc-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone containing a c-7 bicyclic amine moiety with potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. we compared the in vitro and in vivo activities of cfc-222 with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin. cfc-222 was more active than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive bacteria. cfc-222 was particularly active against streptococcus pneumoniae (mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [mic90], 0.2 microg/ml), staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.2 microg/ml for ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains), and enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 0.39 microg/ml). against escherichia coli and other members of the family enterobacteriaceae, cfc-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin (mic90s for e. coli, 0.1 and 0.025 microg/ml, respectively). the in vitro activity of cfc-222 was not influenced by inoculum size, medium composition, or the presence  of horse serum. however, its activity was decreased significantly by a change in  the ph of the medium from 7.0 to 6.0, as was the case for the other quinolones tested. the in vivo protective efficacy of cfc-222 by oral administration was greater than those of the other quinolones tested in a mouse model of intraperitoneally inoculated systemic infection caused by s. aureus. cfc-222 exhibited efficacy comparable to that of ciprofloxacin in the same model of infection caused by gram-negative organisms, such as e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. in this infection model, cfc-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. these results suggest that cfc-222  may be a promising therapeutic agent in various bacterial infections.

TI  == successful single-dose teicoplanin prophylaxis against experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal aortic valve endocarditis.
AB  == teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is administered both intramuscularly and intravenously. it has a prolonged half-life and a less toxic  profile in comparison to those of vancomycin. the efficacy of a single dose of teicoplanin (18 mg/kg of body weight given intramuscularly) for the prevention of endocarditis due to streptococcus oralis, enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was evaluated after applying the rabbit model. vancomycin at a single dose of 30 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to mrsa and  e. faecium, while ampicillin at a single dose of 40 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to s. oralis. rabbits in the teicoplanin group were infected at 1 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) cfu of each strain. rabbits in the other groups were infected at 0.5 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) cfu of s. oralis (ampicillin group)  or e. faecium and mrsa (vancomycin group). all rabbits were sacrificed 5 days later. teicoplanin and vancomycin protected the animals challenged with e. faecium by 87.5 and 50%, respectively, and protected the animals challenged with  mrsa by 100 and 92%, respectively. teicoplanin and ampicillin protected the animals challenged with s. oralis by 100 and 77%, respectively. prevention of endocarditis by teicoplanin was likely to be due to a prolonged inhibition of bacterial growth by the sustained supra-mics. it is concluded that teicoplanin is very effective in preventing experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal endocarditis and may be an attractive alternative antibiotic in patients allergic to beta-lactams, especially in the outpatient setting.

TI  == a review of the in vitro activity of meropenem and comparative antimicrobial agents tested against 30,254 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated world wide.
AB  == the in vitro activity of meropenem (formerly sm-7738), a new carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem and five other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin) against 30,254 clinically significant pathogens isolated in nine countries worldwide. overall, the carbapenems, meropenem and imipenem, were the most active drugs. meropenem was four- to 64-fold more active than imipenem against gram-negative bacteria, including the enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. meropenem was also quite active against ceftazidime-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 87.5 to 100% at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. in contrast, imipenem was four- to eight-fold more active than meropenem against  gram-positive species, including methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. among the anaerobes, strains resistant to meropenem or imipenem were encountered very rarely. these extensive data provide additional in vitro support for the clinical use of meropenem as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent active against key pathogenic species of bacteria.

TI  == development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  == very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. this study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (biomerieux vitek, hazelwood, mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents,  including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. mics of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarblue; accumed international, westlake, ohio). this study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of staphylococcus aureus, group a streptococcus species, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in some instances, the mics were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. the proposed in-flight experiment will  include inoculation of the vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of mics by the mission's astronauts. ground-based studies have shown reproducible mics following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees c to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. for comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) mic values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation  of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. this procedure  can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.

TI  == development of provisional disc diffusion breakpoints for testing quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is an injectable streptogramin with broad activity against many gram-positive bacteria, including streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. although a number of studies have reported the mics of this compound against a variety of bacteria, there are no published reports of disc diffusion testing. we tested total disc masses of 7.5 and 15 micrograms with varying ratios of the component compounds, quinupristin and dalfopristin, combined in the following quinupristin: dalfopristin ratios (in microgram): 7.5:0, 0:7.5, 10:5, 5:10, 5:2.5 and 2.5:5. zone diameters and mics were determined in parallel for 44 isolates of staphylococci, 47 isolates pneumococci and 64 isolates of enterococci. control strains were included for each species tested, including a strain of enterococcus faecalis with known resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin. using tentative definitions for quinupristin/dalfopristin of < or = 2 mg/l as susceptible and > or = 4 mg/l as resistant, each of the four discs containing ratios of both component compounds separated presumptive susceptible organisms from resistant ones better than either quinupristin or dalfopristin alone. the best correlation of zone sizes and mics for predicting susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin at an mic of < or = 2 mg/l was achieved with the 5 micrograms:10 micrograms disc and a zone diameter of > or = 18 mm. these criteria may be useful for identifying organisms  that are presumptively susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin.

AB  == in-vitro activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a semisynthetic injectable streptogramin, and vancomycin were compared against multidrug-resistant enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923 and a methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). combinations of quinupristin/dalfopristin and/or vancomycin with ofloxacin or gentamicin were evaluated using the chequerboard technique. the only synergy observed was that between quinupristin/dalfopristin plus vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin plus gentamicin against e. faecium (fic index < 0.5). time-kill curves were performed over 24 h with an inoculum of 1 x 10(7) cfu/ml and clinically achievable concentrations of quinupristin/dalfopristin, vancomycin, ofloxacin and gentamicin (6, 30, 5 and 5 mg/l, respectively). in time-kill studies, combinations of quinupristin/dalfopristin plus vancomycin and  quinupristin/dalfopristin plus gentamicin were additive, not synergic, against e. faecium and achieved 99.9% killing in 21.2 h and 19.6 h, respectively. none of the combination regimens suppressed the regrowth of e. faecalis. quinupristin/dalfopristin combined with vancomycin demonstrated consistent synergy against atcc 25923 and the mrsa, achieving 99.9% killing in 12.1 h and 11.9 h, respectively. overall, quinupristin/dalfopristin alone demonstrated inhibitory activity against e. faecium, but not against e. faecalis, and bactericidal activity was achieved only with quinupristin/dalfopristin in combination with vancomycin or gentamicin against e. faecium. quinupristin/dalfopristin plus vancomycin was the most potent and reliable combination against both strains of s. aureus in time-kill studies.

TI  == microbiological cultures of heart valves and valve tags are not valuable for patients without infective endocarditis who are undergoing valve replacement.
AB  == we evaluated the significance of the results of microbiological cultures of heart valves and identification tags from newly inserted prosthetic valves that were removed from patients with valvular heart disease; none of these patients had a preoperative diagnosis of endocarditis. we reviewed the charts of patients with positive cultures for evidence of infections before or after surgery. cultures were positive for 11.9% of 219 valves (206 native valves and 13 prosthetic or bioprosthetic valves) and 11.6% of 224 tags. the most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci. typical agents of endocarditis--viridans streptococcus, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus--were cultured from five specimens, and mycobacterium avium complex was identified in six valves. none of the patients with positive valve or tag cultures developed postsurgical endocarditis or wound infection. findings on histopathologic examination of the valves were not consistent with endocarditis. we conclude that the results of cultures of valves from patients without preoperative diagnoses of endocarditis lack clinical significance, and positive tag cultures are not predictive of postsurgical infection. positive cultures are most likely a result  of contamination during surgery or thereafter.

TI  == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora  of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing  depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). iii. differences in susceptibilities from previous years].
AB  == susceptibilities to various antimicrobial agents were examined for enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa that were isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (utis) in 11 hospitals during june, 1995 through may, 1996, and the results were compared with those obtained during the same period in earlier years. 1. macrolide resistant e. faecalis isolated from uncomplicated utis during the latest study period appeared to have increased compared to those in previous  study periods. more than 50% of the isolated e. faecalis during the latest study  period were resistant to macrolide antibiotics, for the first time in our history. 2. no obvious changes were observed through the years for susceptibilities of s. aureus to various antimicrobial agents. vancomycin (vcm) showed the highest activity against s. aureus, with mics below 2 micrograms/ml or below. 3. among e. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to quinolones appeared to have increased over the years with mic90 changed from between 0.125 microgram/ml or below and 0.5 microgram/ml in the 1989-1990 period to between 8 micrograms/ml and 128 micrograms/ml in the latest study period. 4. klebsiella spp. showed higher resistance to most antimicrobial agents during periods of 1993-1994 and 1994-1995, but somewhat lower resistance during period of 1995-1996. no resistant klebsiella spp. were detected from uncomplicated utis during the latest study period. 5. among p. aeruginosa isolates from complicated  utis, resistance isolates to gentamicin appeared to be increasing over the years. resistant strains to quinolones were isolated at lower frequencies during periods of 1991-1994, but higher frequency was observed in the latest period, and mic50s  were between 0.5 and 4 micrograms/ml during 1991-1994, but were 16-32 micrograms/ml during 1995-1996. these susceptibility changes should be utilized in determining clinical treatments.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

AB  == in early 1980's methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was reported as a major pathogenic organism of geriatric hospital infection in japan. at the same time in the geriatric hospital mrsa infection was prevalent. to decrease nosocomial infections some active preventive measures against hospital infection  were taken since oct. 1991. after introduction of preventive measures of hospital infection in the geriatric ward (190 beds) nosocomial bacteremia and pneumonia were markedly decreased in comparison of episode number before introduction of prevention. however several patients with mrsa colonization were observed every month. the aim of this clinical study was to clear how frequent mrsa was isolated from skin. consequently 3 strains (3.4%) of mrsa were observed in 86 cultured skin. in conclusion we considered frequency of mrsa colonization frequency of mrsa colonization on skin was not so high but rather very low under the preventive measures.

TI  == in vitro activity and spectrum of ly333328, a novel glycopeptide derivative.
AB  == reference methods were used to determine the potency of ly333328, a semisynthetic glycopeptide derivative with a key n-alkylation substitution, against 833 strains (393 gram-positive strains and representative gram-negative bacilli) with various defined resistance mechanisms. the mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (mic90s) (in micrograms per milliliter) of ly333328 and the percentages of strains at < or = 8 micrograms/ml were as follows: for oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 100%, and for oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 100%; for oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermis, 4 and 100%, and for oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 8 and 96%; for streptococcus serogroups a, b, c, and g, 0.25 to 1 and 100%; for streptococcus pneumoniae < or = 0.015 to 0.06 and 100%; for enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 100%;  and for vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium, 0.25 and 100%, and for vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, 4 and 100%. ly333328 was not active (mic50, > or = 16 micrograms/ml) against more than 400 representative strains of  enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonads, acinetobacter spp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pathogenic neisseria  spp., and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. gram-positive anaerobes were ly333328  susceptible (mics, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). test methods and conditions may have  affected mics of ly333328, with most (species variation) agar dilution mics being greater than the broth microdilution mics.

TI  == high incidence of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in 4 intensive care units  at a university hospital in sweden.
AB  == the frequency of antibiotic resistance among bacteria in 4 intensive care units (icus) at a university hospital in sweden was investigated annually from 1993 to  1996. an increase in ampicillin-resistant enterococci from 1993 to 1995 was seen  which was due to a shift from enterococcus faecalis to enterococcus faecium. after a special infection control programme was instituted, the rate of ampicillin resistance among enterococci and the number of e. faecium isolates declined during 1996. the oxacillin resistance rates for staphylococcus aureus were < or = 2%, while most of the coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) were oxacillin resistant. no vancomycin-resistant enterococci or staphylococci were seen. the ciprofloxacin resistance rate for cns and enterococci spp. were high. relatively, high levels of resistance to cefotaxime and piperacillin/tazobactam among enterobacter spp. were also seen. during 1995 and 1996 pseudomonas aeruginosa showed increasing resistance to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam. this was due to an outbreak among rather few patients. the overall resistance rates for gram-negative bacteria were low for aminoglycosides and imipenem. from 1993 to 1996 the total antibiotic consumption  decreased by 27% in the whole hospital and 16.5% in the icus. however, the reduced antibiotic consumption was paralleled with a 23% decrease in the total number of patients treated in the hospital from 1993 to 1996. in contrast there was an 11.5% increase in the number of icu patients treated during this period. the conclusion is that all icus within a hospital should have a programme for 'on-line' antibiotic resistance surveillance of drugs used in that unit in order  to change the empiric treatment when there is an increase in antibiotic resistance. it is also important to survey the antibiotic consumption in the icus in order to avoid further selective pressure on bacteria showing increased resistance rates.

TI  == multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. an update on current microbiological patterns.
AB  == although resistance has developed among gram-positive pathogens to penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, quinolones and macrolides, the glycopeptides seem to remain largely unaffected. however, the recent emergence and range of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci, well documented in the usa but not in the rest of the world, have prompted this european surveillance study. the european glycopeptide resistance survey was undertaken in 1995 in 9 countries and involved 70 microbiological centres. the primary aims of the survey were as follows: (i) to perform a microbiological quality assurance assessment to evaluate the ability of participating laboratories to correctly identify the strains and assess their  glycopeptide susceptibility; and (ii) to accurately determine the level of glycopeptide resistance among staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci in european hospitals. the in vitro activity of several other antibiotics was assessed on strains isolated from the italian centres. in total, 7078 gram-positive isolates were collected in europe, and national coordinators used the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) agar dilution reference method to successfully retest 96% of these. according to mode minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), teicoplanin activity was similar to that of vancomycin against staphylococcus aureus. in general, the range of mics for teicoplanin was wider than that for vancomycin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. against enterococcus spp. and streptococcus spp., teicoplanin was  4 times more active than vancomycin. the greatest number of glycopeptide refractory organisms was evident among enterococci; resistance was observed to be approximately 10 times more frequent in enterococcus faecium than in e. faecalis. the results from the italian isolates were similar to those from the overall study. in particular, teicoplanin was 2- to 8-fold more active than vancomycin against the majority of the enterococci. the incidence of enterococcal resistance was lower in italy (0.6% for teicoplanin and 0.9% for vancomycin) than in europe  (1.7% for teicoplanin and 2.3% for vancomycin). this extensive survey confirms that teicoplanin is more active than vancomycin against enterococci and streptococci, and that both display similar potency against staphylococci.

TI  == cell-cell communication in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == in gram-positive bacteria, many important processes are controlled by cell-to-cell communication, which is mediated by extracellular signal molecules produced by the bacteria. most of these signaling molecules are peptides or modified peptides. signal processing, in most cases, involves either transduction across the cytoplasmic membrane or import of the signal and subsequent interaction with intracellular effectors. concentrations of signal in the nanomolar range or below are frequently sufficient for biological activity. the microbial processes controlled by extracellular signaling include the expression  of virulence factors, the expression of gene transfer functions, and the production of antibiotics.

AB  == etest, a stable-gradient antimicrobial susceptibility test method (ab biodisk, solna, sweden), was compared to the agar dilution method for tests with amikacin, tobramycin, aztreonam, cefdinir, cefprozil, ceftazidime and sparfloxacin. the study design followed recommended guidelines for 510(k) application by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda). results demonstrated etest accuracy (mic +/-  1.0 log2 dilutions compared to agar dilution mic) to be 90.4% with only one of 1150 comparisons showing a reproducible variation of 2 log2 dilutions. categorical equivalency was > or = 92% for all drugs except ceftazidime (82 to 89%), but false-susceptible error was rare (< 0.1%). etest was very reproducible  (100% of results +/- 1.0 log2 dilution) and quality control results conformed to  published mic ranges. the etest seems to render accurate results for these seven  antimicrobial agents evaluated.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem, was studied in comparison with other beta-lactam antimicrobials against 711 recent clinical isolates including gram-negative, gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. mic data showed that faropenem was active against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (mics <  or = 4 mg/l), with reduced activity against serratia spp. (mic90 = 32 mg/l). in common with its comparators, faropenem had weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic > 128 mg/l). faropenem was active against staphylococci, although for mrsa mics were raised (mic90 = 2 mg/l) compared with those for mssa (mic90 = 0.12 mg/l). faropenem was also found to be  active against streptococci, neisseria spp., enterococcus faecalis and beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae and  moraxella catarrhalis. of the anaerobic bacteria studied, faropenem was most active against peptostreptococci and clostridium perfringens (mic90 < or = 1 mg/l) and bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 4 mg/l). an increase in inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu raised faropenem mics for morganella morganii from 0.06-1 mg/l to 2-4 mg/l and for mrsa from 0.25-2 mg/l to 8 mg/l (a similar increase was not observed for mssa). the mics of faropenem were not affected by the presence of either 20% or 70% (v/v) serum. mics for faropenem to 11 well characterized beta-lactamase producers were similar to those of non-producers. in hydrolysis studies, faropenem was shown to be highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases,  including tem-1, shv-1, the extended spectrum beta-lactamases, tem-3 and tem-9, and the beta-lactamase produced by staphylococcus aureus (nctc 11561).

TI  == [clinically isolated bacterii seen in complicated infections].
AB  == the spectrum of causative bacterial agents responsible for post-operative infections in the surgical field have dramatically changed with time. this could  be due to recent technical progress in bacterial extraction or the result of more effective antibiotics used post-operatively. nevertheless nosocomial infections including those caused by mrsa still demand our close attention. commonly extracted bacterii include staphylococcus spp., e. faecalis, e. coli, klebsiella  spp., e. cloacae, p. aeruginosa and bacteroides spp., but with regards to pathogenicity, extraction frequency and drug resistance, agents requiring the highest note of caution may be mrsa, p. aeruginosa and bacteroides spp. mrsa is still the bacterium which makes the most frequent appearance in the clinical field, and the only effective antibiotic to mrsa is vancomycin. in addition, p. aeruginosa is the most common bacterial agent seen in post-operative infections and also the agent to which many of the cephem drugs do not express a high degree of antibacterial effect. furthermore, about half of the bacteroides spp. are beta-lactamase-producing strains which deactive the effect of penicillin and cephem drugs within the infection site. a drug which proves effective against e.  coli may nevertheless become somewhat ineffective against this agent when found in a mixed infection and if the drug lacks stability against beta-lactamase. clinically, mixed infections including some or even all the above agents are known to occur, continuously drawing our close attention.

(ab titers were > or = 1/512 and igm > or = 1/64 in 30% of patients  1 year later). heterologous ab: in spite of statistically significant difference  found in sie versus the other groups, sensitivity of this test (threshold 1/256)  is low, confidence interval include expected random value (50%), specificity is 88%. conclusions: the utility of homologous ab for diagnosing infective endocarditis is demonstrated. on the contrary for heterologous ab, antigenic common fractions must be found in the different species.

AB  == the regulation of intracellular concentrations of organic solutes, including glycine betaine, is an important adaptive response to osmotic stress for escherichia coli. the clinical significance of glycine betaine to uropathogens is not clear. clinical isolates of e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. saprophyticus, and enterococcus faecalis accumulated glycine betaine from hyperosmotic media. the addition of glycine betaine to hyperosmotic minimal medium accelerated the growth rates of all species tested except p. mirabilis. however, when clinical strains of e. coli were transferred from urine with low osmolality to hyperosmotic urine, there was no slowing of the growth rate. there  was no difference in growth rates of e. coli isolates from acute pyelonephritis,  cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria nor from fecal isolates. the ability to accumulate osmolytes, although it may be a factor in the adaptation to hypertonic environments, was not related to virulence.

AB  == the in vitro activity of the trinem sanfetrinem (formerly gv104326) (gv) was compared with that of vancomycin, ampicillin, and/or nafcillin against 287 gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and multiresistant enterococci, by the agar and microbroth dilution methods. gv demonstrated 2 to 16 times more activity than ampicillin and nafcillin against the majority of these organisms. the mic range of gv was 16 to 64 micrograms/ml for 19 enterococcus faecium strains that were highly resistant to ampicillin (ampicillin mic range, 64 to 512 micrograms/ml) and vancomycin resistant and 0.25 to 32 micrograms/ml for resistant rhodococcus spp. similar activities (+/-1 dilution) were observed by either the agar or the broth microdilution method. gv  demonstrated bactericidal activity against a beta-lactamase-producing enterococcus faecalis strain and against two methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains in 10(5)-cfu/ml inocula. synergy between gv and gentamicin was observed against an e. faecalis strain that lacked high-level gentamicin resistance. the activity of gv suggests this compound warrants further study.

TI  == quinupristin-dalfopristin (rp 59500): an injectable streptogramin combination.
AB  == the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, activity, and potential clinical role of quinupristin-dalfopristin (rp 59500) are described. quinupristin-dalfopristin is  the first injectable formulation of the streptogramin antibiotics. streptogramin  drug products are each composed of two chemically distinct compounds, which when  administered together act synergistically by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. quinupristin-dalfopristin has shown activity in vitro against many strains of streptococci and staphylococci, including methicillin- and erythromycin-resistant strains of staphylococci. the combination is more active against enterococcus faecium than enterococcus faecalis. it has also shown activity in vitro against certain gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. the mean maximum blood concentration at the end of a one-hour infusion ranged from 0.95 mg/l for a 1.4-mg/kg dose to 24.2 mg/l for a 29.4-mg/kg dose; there was a linear  correlation between dose and mean area under the concentration-time curve. mean half-life ranged from 1.27 to 1.53 hours. the drug is under investigation in the  united states in phase iii trials. of 60 evaluable patients with documented bacteremia involving e. faecium resistant to vancomycin, 40 (67%) had a favorable clinical response. of 11 patients with bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 78% had a favorable response. the efficacy of quinupristin-dalfopristin in treating resistant infections has also been suggested by smaller studies and case reports. the drug may be useful in the prophylaxis of endocarditis. adverse reactions are generally mild and transient.  quinupristin-dalfopristin may be useful in treating serious gram-positive infections, but more clinical study is needed.

TI  == influence of lipoteichoic acid structure on recognition by the macrophage scavenger receptor.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) belong to the immunostimulatory class of molecules of gram-positive bacteria (gpb). previous investigations showed that the macrophage  scavenger receptor (sr), a glycosylated trimeric transmembrane protein, binds directly to many gpb, possibly via lta. sr binding to other ligands is dependent  upon the spatial characteristics of the repeating negative charge of the ligand.  we therefore investigated sr recognition of lta species with various charge densities and distributions by determining the capacity of these ltas to compete  with the binding of metabolically labeled sr to beads coated with the known sr ligand polyguanylic acid. staphylococcus aureus lta, a classical lta type (unbranched 1,3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain covalently bound to a membrane  diacylglyceroglycolipid), had a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) for inhibition of sr binding of 0.84 microg/ml. when the s. aureus lta was rendered more negatively charged by removal of ester-linked alanine from the polyglycerophosphate backbone, the ic50 dropped to 0.23 microg/ml. other polyglycerophosphate ltas from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, listeria monocytogenes, listeria welshimeri, and streptococcus sanguis showed ic50s of 0.5 to 2.1 microg/ml, supporting the role of negative charge in binding to sr. accordingly, the zwitterionic lta of streptococcus pneumoniae and clostridium innocuum lta substituted with positively charged sugar residues had no binding capacity. monoglycerophosphate branches, but not succinyl ester, affected binding of lipoglycans. the data presented above parallel the previous findings for whole organisms and support the role of surface-associated lta as a major ligand of gpb for binding to sr. whether binding of lta and whole gpb to macrophages initiates uptake and degradation or results in signal transduction remains to be determined.

TI  == [determination of serum aminoglycoside and vancomycin concentrations by the microbiological method in the presence of other antimicrobials].
AB  == the determination of serum concentrations of antimicrobials with a narrow therapeutic range by microbiological method requires some modifications when the  patient is under combined antimicrobial therapy. the methodological conditions for the appraisal of aminoglycosides and vancomycin in the presence of other drugs were evaluated by using strains with selective sensitivity to the antimicrobial to be tested or by the adding crude extracts of beta-lactamases for the inactivation of the beta-lactam antimicrobials. these beta-lactamases were obtained from enterobacter cloacae p99 (derepressed mutant) cultures for the inactivation of penicillins and first, second and third generation cephalosporins, as well as from stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia m 1484 cultures for the hydrolysis of imipenem. the strains allowing vancomycin appraisal and indifferent to the synergic activity of other drugs in the mixture  were s. aureus m 2120, when the accompanying antimicrobials were gentamicin, ciprofloxacin or rifampicin, and e. faecalis m 2113, e. avium m 2091 and s. aureus m 2101 when the drugs in the mixture were amikacin, lincomycin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. for the appraisal of gentamicin in the presence of vancomycin or fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin), e. coli m 1376 was the most suitable strain, while the use of k. pneumoniae atcc 10031 was required for the appraisal of amikacin or netilmicin. when rifampicin was the accompanying antimicrobial, e. coli m 1495 turned out more adequate. e. coli m 1462 proved to be more satisfactory for gentamicin, amikacin and netilmicin dosages in samples also containing chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or tetracycline.

AB  == the induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) by polytetrafluoroethylene (ptfe) particles (5-50 microns) and by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) and lipoteichoic acid (lta) was examined in raw cell cultures. twenty-four-hour culture supernatants from the treated and control cells were assayed for tnf-alpha using a mouse l929 cell cytotoxicity assay. untreated raw cells produced low levels of endogenous tnf-alpha in the culture supernatants. addition of 0.5 ng to 1 microgram/ ml lps or 1 ng to 1 microgram/ml lta increased the tnf-alpha production by 7-3570-fold and 2-815-fold, respectively. addition of 1-5 mg ptfe increased the tnf-alpha production by 6-17-fold over the untreated control cell levels. the cells exposed to ptfe and 0.5 ng/ml lps or 5 ng/ml lta produced tnf-alpha levels that were significantly higher than those produced by any inducer alone. thus, both lta, a gram-positive  bacterial cell wall component and lps, a gram-negative bacterial cell wall component, can induce tnf-alpha production, which is further enhanced by ptfe particles in raw cells.

TI  == the tetracycline resistance gene tet(m) exhibits mosaic structure.
AB  == tetracycline resistance genes of the m class, tet(m), are typically found on mobile genetic elements as the conjugative transposons of gram-positive bacteria. by comparing the sequences of eight different tet(m) genes (from enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, ureaplasma urealyticum, and neisseria), a mosaic structure was detected which could be traced to two distinct alleles. the two alleles displayed a divergence of 8% and  a different g/c content. the block structure of these genes provides evidence for the contribution of homologous recombination to the evolution and the heterogeneity of the tet(m) locus. unlike described cases of chromosomally located mosaic loci, tet(m) is a relatively recently acquired determinant in the  species examined and it would appear that mosaic structure within tet(m) has evolved after acquisition of the gene by the mobile genetic elements upon which it is located.

TI  == chromosomal gentamicin resistance transposon tn3706 in streptococcus agalactiae b128.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae b128 is the only highly gentamicin-resistant group b streptococcal (gbs) strain described so far. this strain carries a chromosomal gentamicin resistance transposon, designated tn3706, which is similar, if not identical, to the tn4001 and tn5281 transpons detected in staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, respectively. transposition of tn3706 occurred onto the gbs plasmid pip501 in two different loci of its 7.5-kb avaii fragment carrying the genes for chloramphenicol and erythromycin resistance. molecular analysis of pip501 derivatives showed that tn3706 is composed of a central fragment containing the aac6'-aph2" gene; this fragment is flanked by two tandemly repeated copies of is256 at the 5' extremity of the resistance gene and  a single inverted copy of is256 at its 3' extremity. the two tandemly repeated copies of is256 were separated by a 6-bp segment identical to that found, in the  same orientation, in the is256-aac6'-aph2" junction. the hybrid replicons pip501::tn3706 were found to be structurally unstable following conjugative transfer between gbs strains. numerous individual copies of is256 were detected in b128, but this insertion sequence was not found in the 11 wild-type, gentamicin-susceptible gbs strains studied.

TI  == [multicenter study of isolated micro-organisms resistant to antimicrobials in 10  portuguese hospitals in 1994].
AB  == in 1994, microbiology laboratories of ten portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. from 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples  significant numbers of escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida spp. were isolated. escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of  extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. a great variation in resistance values of p. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. resistance to methicillin in s. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an  average of 47%, and it was even higher with s. epidermidis (c.3000) and s. haemolyticus (c.650). only vancomycin was always active against these strains. in e. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. e. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.

TI  == in vitro activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  == oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. u-100592 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and u-100766 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. mics were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective mics of u-100592 and u-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. aureus, 4  and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2  micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. most strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (vana, vanb, and vanc resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and m. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. the  presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. the spontaneous mutation frequencies of s. aureus atcc 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for u-100592 and u-100766, respectively. serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.

TI  == [in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem antibiotic].
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem, were evaluated in comparison with imipenem (ipm), meropenem (mepm), ceftazidime (caz)  and flomoxef (fmox). sulopenem had broad and potent antibacterial spectra against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including enterococcus faecalis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, enterobacter spp. and citrobacter freundii. sulopenem showed concentration-dependent bactericidal activities against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. morphological observation using phase-contrast microscope revealed that sulopenem induced spherical cell formation with e. coli  and k. pneumoniae at lower concentrations and bacteriolysis at higher concentrations. therapeutic efficacies of sulopenem against systemic infections in mice were almost equal to those of imipenem against streptococcus pneumoniae.  while its therapeutic efficacies were superior to those of meropenem, ceftazidime and flomoxef against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae, they were inferior to those of  imipenem/cilastatin against s. aureus, k. pneumoniae and a. calcoaceticus.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

AB  == a 2.8-kb cryptic plasmid showing no homology to either pfx3 (rolling circle, pe194-type) or pci305 (theta-type) lactococcal replicons was identified in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. the plasmid, pwc1, was compatible with both pci3340 (a pci305 derivative) and pfx3 in l. lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. sequence analysis of pwc1 showed one major orf encoding a protein with a deduced  size of 316 amino acids (aa). database comparisons showed that the protein was distinct from the pfx- and pci-type replication proteins (less than 21% aa identity), but shared significant homology (up to 57% aa identity) with the replication proteins from a different group of rolling circle plasmids (pc194-type) commonly found in gram-positive bacteria. a pc194-type rolling circle plasmid has not been previously described in l. lactis. further sequence analysis showed a conserved double-stranded origin of replication in pwc1 preceded by a large (118-bp) direct repeat. the chloramphenicol-resistance gene from pc194 was inserted into a nonessential region of pwc1 to give pcp12. the host range of pcp12 included streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus, but not escherichia coli. both pcp12 and to a lesser extent pwc1 generated single-stranded dna (ssdna) in l. lactis. a possible single-stranded origin of replication was identified by sequence analysis of pwc1 and by comparing levels of ssdna produced by pcp12 deletion derivatives. the pwc1 replicon may be a useful addition to other replicons currently available for vector construction.

TI  == role of the c terminus in antigen p1 surface localization in streptococcus mutans and two related cocci.
AB  == the c terminus of the major surface protein p1 from streptococcus mutans is composed of a hydrophilic domain, an lpntgv motif, a hydrophobic domain, and a charged tail. these features are shared by surface proteins from many gram-positive coccal bacteria. to investigate the role of the c-terminal domains  in antigen p1 surface localization, full-length and truncated p1 gene constructs, which were expressed on the shuttle vector pdl276, were transformed into the p1-negative mutant s. mutans sm3352, streptococcus gordonii dl-1, and enterococcus faecalis uv202. transformants were tested for expression of p1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assaying and western blotting. the results showed that full-length p1 was expressed by transformants of all three bacteria and was  localized on the cell surface. a fusion protein composed of the staphylococcus aureus fibronectin binding protein c terminus and the p1 protein n terminus was found to surface localize in s. mutans. deletion of the entire c-terminal domains resulted in p1 being expressed in the culture supernatant. a p1 truncation, which carried only the hydrophilic domain at its c terminus, was found partially associated with the cell surface. this truncated p1 was readily removed from the  isolated cell wall by hot sodium dodecyl sulfate-mercaptoethanol extraction. in contrast, the full-length p1 remained associated with the isolated cell wall after similar treatment, suggesting covalent linkages between the full-length p1  and the cell wall. the results described above showed that antigen p1 was anchored to the cell wall by its c-terminal domains probably via covalent linkages with the cell wall. the results also support a universal mechanism involving the c-terminal domains for protein surface localization among this group of gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  == a one-year (1993) survey of the distribution of pathogens causing respiratory and urinary infections and their antimicrobial susceptibility was performed. the most common bacteria isolated from the lower respiratory tract of patients in a district general hospital were pseudomonas aeruginosa (35.9%) and staphylococcus  aureus (21.4%). about half of the pseudomonas strains revealed a resistance to imipenem and gentamicin, whereas almost all staphylococcus strains were resistant to penicillin g. the most common isolates from urine of in and out-patients were  escherichia coli (32.3% and 39.8%) and enterococcus faecalis (16.6% and 14.2%). escherichia coli strains were largely susceptible to almost all chemoantibiotics  tested, whereas enterococcus faecalis demonstrated a high resistance pattern. pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urine were more sensitive to chemoantibiotics than respiratory strains and the susceptibility of staphylococcus aureus isolated from hospitalized or out-patients was different. a periodic monitoring system devised to give information about the circulation of bacteria and the chemoantibiotic resistance in a local context would be useful to assess the local trends and select drugs for therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of polyurethane and silicone catheters containing low concentrations of silver: a new perspective in prevention of polymer-associated foreign-body-infections.
AB  == in modern medicine, infection is one of the most serious complications of implanted plastic devices. the host is not able to overcome this special type of  opportunistic infection despite having a normal immune response and a low virulence of most of the bacteria involved. antimicrobial therapy alone generally cannot cure the infection and the removal of catheters often remains the only choice of therapy. bacterial adhesion to the polymer surface of the catheter, be  it luminal or external, is an important step in the pathogenesis of catheter-associated infections. in this report, we describe new approaches to the prevention of infections by impregnation of polyurethane and silicone with silver by two different methods. the antimicrobial activity of these silver-impregnated  catheters is more than 10 fold higher for coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns)  compared to catheters without silver. similar results are obtained with other microbial organisms like staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the new polymers show no cytotoxic or thrombogenic side effects in vitro.

AB  == isolated pathogenic bacteria from sputum of the patients with pulmonary emphysema who were admitted in our hospital from 1984 to 1994 were examined to elucidate the relationship between isolated bacteria from sputum and pulmonary functions including vital capacity (vc), forced expiratory volume (fev1.0), pao2 and paco2. vc of the patients from whom mssa (methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus) or enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis) were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom streptococcus pneumoniae (s. pneumoniae), branhamella catarrhalis (b. catarrhalis) or haemophilus influenza (h. influenza)  were isolated. fev1.0 had a similar tendency as vc in terms of isolated organisms from the patients with emphysema. similarly, po2 of the patients from whom mssa or e. cloacae were isolated was significantly lower than that of the patients from whom s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenzae were isolated, and pco2  of the patients from whom s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenza were isolated. there was also impaired respiratory function in the patients from whom  mssa, escherichia coli (e. coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p. aeruginosa), xanthomonas maltophilia (x. maltophilia) or enterobacter cloacae (e. cloacae) were isolated, compared with those in the patients from whom s. pneumonia, b. catarrhalis or h. influenzae were isolated. these results suggest that isolated pathogenic bacteria are shifted from s. pneumoniae, b. catarrhalis or h. influenza to mssa, e. coli, p. aeruginosa, x. maltophilia or e. cloacae in the course of impairment of respiratory function in pulmonary emphysema. the treatment and prophylaxis for acute exacerbation in pulmonary emphysema should be based on these results.

TI  == antibiotics and prevention of microbial colonization of catheters.
AB  == slime-producing staphylococci frequently colonize catheters, and when they are embedded in biofilm, they become resistant to various antibiotics. in the study that is described, the comparative efficacies of vancomycin, clindamycin, novobiocin, and minocycline, alone or in combination with rifampin, were tested in an in vitro model of colonization. the model consisted of the modified robbins device with antibiotic-impregnated cement filling the lumen of catheter segments. the synergistic combination of minocycline and rifampin was the most efficacious  in preventing bacterial colonization of slime-producing strains of staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus to catheter surfaces. a similar trend was observed when the inhibitory activities of polyurethane catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin were compared with the inhibitory activities of catheters coated with other antimicrobial agents. the inhibitory activities of catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin against s. epidermidis, s. aureus, and enterococcus faecalis strains, for example, were significantly better than those of catheters coated with vancomycin (p < 0.05). the inhibitory activities of catheters coated with minocycline and rifampin against gram-negative bacilli and candida albicans were comparable to those of catheters coated with ceftazidime and amphotericin b, respectively. we found that the combination of minocycline and rifampin is unique and highly effective in preventing the colonization of catheters with slime-producing staphylococci and that it also displays a broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against gram-negative bacteria and  yeast cells.

AB  == a new series of 6-(hydroxyethyl)penems 2-substituted with amino acid-related side chains was synthesized. the nature of the amino acyl derivative proved to be crucial both from a synthetic point of view, as beta-lactam ring opening can compete with c-2 nucleophilic substitution, and for antibacterial activity. primary amino acid amides emerged as the most suitable side chains for enhancing  permeability through a gram-negative outer membrane. in vitro activity of the new 2-[(aminoamido)methyl]penems 3a-u was influenced by the nature and position of the amide moiety, the ring size for cyclic amides, and the configuration of the amino acid. compounds bearing amides derived from small n-methyl amino acids (such as 3a) or from cyclic amino acids (such as prolinamide 3p and 4-hydroxyprolinamide 3r) showed broad spectrum in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.

TI  == susceptibility of staphylococci and enterococci to glycopeptides comparison of 3  test methods.
AB  == the significance of grampositive bacteria, especially staphylococci and enterococci, as nosocomial pathogens has increased in the last decade. furthermore, resistance to commonly used antibiotics like beta-lactams has also become more common and even resistance to glycopeptides has been observed. we evaluated the susceptibility of 150 staphylococcal clinical isolates (52 s. epidermidis, 52 s. haemolyticus, 10 s. saprophyticus, 10 s. hominis, 4 s. warneri, 4 s. simulans, 4 s. capitis and 14 s. aureus) and of 50 enterococci (49  e. faecalis, 1 e. faecium) to the glycopeptides, vancomycin and teicoplanin. the  data from the agar dilution test used as reference method were compared with the  results from the e test and the agar disk diffusion test. concerning vancomycin,  no resistance among all the staphylococcal isolates was observed whereas one single enterococcal strain (e. faecium) proved to be resistant. the overall resistance of staphylococcal isolates against teicoplanin was about 10.7% (15 s.  haemolyticus, 1 s. epidermidis) being mainly due to the high proportion of s. haemolyticus strains (52 out of 150) among the staphylococcal isolates. teicoplanin resistance among the enterococci was not detected. for vancomycin, a  very close correlation between the mics from the agar dilution test and the e test was noticed. as concerns teicoplanin, the mics from the e-test were usually  somewhat lower than those obtained by the agar dilution test. no correlation was  found between the mics of resistant and intermediate staphylococcal strains and the results from the teicoplanin agar disk diffusion test. for routine teicoplanin susceptibility testing of staphylococci, the determination of the mic (e.g., by the e test) is much more reliable for detecting resistant strains than  the agar disk diffusion test.

TI  == activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble cd14.
AB  == in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. lps-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte lps receptor, scd14. we evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial e-selectin and tissue factor expression through scd14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huve). both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, enterobacter cloacae, haemophilus influenzae, and klebsiella pneumoniae) but not  viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent e-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. tissue factor activity  on huve, indicated by factor x activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in huve, indicated by the appearance of e-selectin-specific mrna and by the demonstration of activation of nf-kappa b, a trans-activating factor necessary for e-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. in contrast, neither e-selectin mrna nor activation of nf-kappa b was detected in huve treated with gram-positive bacteria. endothelial  cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against cd14. furthermore, cho-k1 cells, transfected with human recombinant cd14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by cho-k1 nf-kappa b activation. we conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common scd14-dependent pathway.

TI  == characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  == an internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase  chain reaction assay. the dna sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes were determined. comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of  the sod proteins from bacillus stearothermophilus, listeria monocytogenes, and streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. phylogenetic analysis of sod peptides showed that members of the genera streptococcus and those of the genera  enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. the method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various gram-positive pathogens.

AB  == we typed 39 sets of multiple bacterial isolates of the same species from patients by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of genomic dna (pfge). isolates were cultured from different sites or over a 2-week or longer interval. staphylococcus aureus,  enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter cloacae were tested. excluding e. cloacae, 28 of 32  sets of isolates (87%) demonstrated only identical or highly related pfge types.  four of the seven sets of e. cloacae showed different types. for species other than e. cloacae, our results suggest that patients are usually colonized and infected with a single strain of these bacterial pathogens. unlike all of the other tested species, e. cloacae pfge typing differences suggested the presence of multiple strains causing colonization and infection.

TI  == emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  == we have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. after eight years of use, 97-100% of enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. after six years of use, 94%-100% of enterobacteriaceae (except providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of p. stuartii, a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa declined from 100%  to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. there were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal mic of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/l; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/l decreased from 94% to 64%. imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == bactericidal activity of copper and noncopper paints.
AB  == objective: to screen copper and noncopper paints for their bactericidal effectiveness in rendering surfaces self-disinfecting. design: tested paints were applied to glass coverslips, cured, inoculated with test organisms (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis), and dried. after 0, 24, or 48 hours, surviving organisms  were eluted and enumerated, and counts compared with those obtained from inoculated control (unpainted) coverslips for the corresponding time periods. copper elution from select copper paints was quantified by complete immersion of  coated coverslips followed by spectroscopic analysis to infer a threshold relationship between kill and copper release. results: nearly all of the tested copper paints were capable of reducing organism counts to negligible levels within 24 hours. exterior latex paints supplemented with a fungicide were similarly efficacious. standard interior latex paint reduced bacterial counts to  nearly zero within 24 hours for e coli and p aeruginosa, and to zero within 48 hours for e faecalis. however, substantial survival of s aureus occurred (up to 4 logs at 24 hours). chi-squared analysis of elution and cidal data indicated that  lethality was dependent on copper release in excess of 32 micrograms. conclusion: the data support presumptive bactericidal claims for several copper and noncopper paints. despite controversy over environment-based contagion, such paints could be used to render surfaces self-disinfecting in strategic locations where environmental causation of nosocomial infections is suspected.

TI  == synthesis and antibacterial activity of some novel 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-pyridinyl-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids. potent antistaphylococcal agents.
AB  == the palladium-catalyzed coupling of 3- and 4-(trialkylstannyl)pyridines with 7-bromo or 7-chloro 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylates has provided access to the corresponding 1-substituted 1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-7-pyridinyl-3-quinolinecarboxylic acids. the antibacterial activity of these derivatives was studied with the finding that the optimal 1- and 7-position substituents for gram positive activity are cyclopropyl and 4-(2,6-dimethylpyridinyl), respectively. we find that for the fluorine-substituted derivatives studied, the position of the fluorine on the quinolone nucleus or the number of fluorine atoms does not seem to be important for good gram positive activity. for 1-cyclopropyl 7-(2,6-dimethyl-4-pyridinyl) derivatives, the 6-fluoro 4a, 8-fluoro 10d, 6,8-difluoro 10b, and 5,6,8-trifluoro 8, all provided equal antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213. there is also a correlation between the substitution on the 7-(4-pyridinyl) group and the gram positive activity, particularly for s. aureus, clearly indicating that the 2,6-dimethylpyridinyl group is optimal. the mic50 value for the most potent agents in this study against s. aureus atcc 29213 is 0.008 microgram/ml. by comparison, ciprofloxacin and aminopyrrolidine 28 gave values of 0.25 and 0.015 microgram/ml, respectively, against this organism.

TI  == conjugative mobilization of a vancomycin resistance plasmid by a putative enterococcus faecium sex pheromone response plasmid.
AB  == recent epidemiological evidence suggests that horizontal gene transfer may be an  important mechanism for dissemination of vancomycin resistance. a filter mating survey of 21 vana enterococcus faecium isolates from the new york hospital showed that 14 of these isolates transferred vancomycin resistance (vmr) to the plasmid-free reference strain enterococcus faecalis jh2-2. one isolate, e. faecium r7, was selected for further study based on its ability to transfer vmr to strain jh2-2 in liquid culture. analysis of the plasmid content of transconjugants revealed three general classes. the predominant class (28 of 47 transconjugants) contained two separate plasmids: phkk702 and phkk703. phkk702 is a 41-kb plasmid that contains an element indistinguishable from the vmr transposon tn1546 and an element that hybridizes with an ermb probe from the staphylococcus aureus erythromycin resistance transposon tn551. phkk703 is a 55-kb plasmid that hybridizes with probes for the sex pheromone response genes prga, prgb, and prgx derived from the e. faecalis plasmid pcf10. the second group of transconjugants (18 of 47) contained various recombinant forms of phkk702 and  phkk703, whereas a third transconjugant class contained only phkk702 (1 of 47). transconjugants that contained both phkk702 and phkk703 were able to efficiently  transfer vmr to recipient strains in broth or on filters. however, no transfer of vmr was detected using the donor containing only phkk702. the transfer of vmr from the recombination-deficient derivative of e. faecalis jh2-2 [strain uv202(phkk702, phkk703)] was reduced 600-fold compared to that of jh2-2(phkk702,  phkk703). we propose that phkk703 functions as an e. faecium sex pheromone response plasmid that conjugatively mobilizes phkk702, and that a major pathway for this mobilization may require donor-mediated recombination proficiency. this  report provides the first example in which a plasmid containing a tn1546-related  element is conjugatively mobilized.

TI  == primosome assembly site in bacillus subtilis.
AB  == a single-strand initiation site was detected on the enterococcus faecalis plasmid pam beta 1 by its ability to prevent accumulation of single stranded dna of a rolling circle plasmid, both in bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus. this site, designated ssia, is located on the lagging strand template, approximately 150 bp downstream from the replication origin. ssia priming activity requires the dnae primase, the dnac replication fork helicase, as well as the products of the  dnab, dnad and dnai genes of b.subtilis, but not the rna polymerase. the primase  and the replication fork helicase requirements indicate that ssia is a primosome  assembly site. interestingly, the pam beta 1 lagging strand synthesis is inefficient when any of the proteins involved in ssia activity is mutated, but occurs efficiently in the absence of ssia. this suggests that normal plasmid replication requires primosome assembly and that the primosome can assemble not only at ssia but also elsewhere on the plasmid. this work for the first time describes a primosome in a gram-positive bacterium. involvement of the b.subtilis proteins dnab, dnad and dnai, which do not have any known analogue in escherichia coli, raises the possibility that primosome assembly and/or function in b.subtilis differs from that in e.coli.

TI  == toc-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == toc-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. toc-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. toc-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin,  and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and  had an mic comparable to that of vancomycin (the mics of toc-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). against enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, toc-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus pneumoniae, toc-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. against streptococcus pyogenes, toc-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. in addition, the activity of toc-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against haemophilus influenzae, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and morganella morganii. in terms of bactericidal effect against mrsa, toc-39 was superior to vancomycin. no mutant resistant to toc-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible mrsa strains. in  murine systemic infection models, toc-39 showed potent activity against s. aureus and e. coli. against highly mrsa, the activity of toc-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.

TI  == rapid identification of common human pathogens by high-resolution proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
AB  == routine procedures for recovery of bacteria from clinical specimens involve culturing the latter on various nonselective and selective agar media. the bacteria are then identified by means of biochemical and immunological test procedures. reduction of the time required to identify the bacteria is highly desirable for rapid clinical diagnosis. towards this end the potential of proton  nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy for providing a "fingerprint" within the proton spectrum of five bacterial genera, reflecting their characteristic cell wall constituents, has been investigated. establishing a database of high-resolution proton nmr spectra of a large number of bacterial species is a prerequisite for attaining this objective. a database has been established for five common human pathogens: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. on the basis of the presence of characteristic resonances in their spectra, a simple algorithm has been developed to differentiate and identify these microorganisms. the nmr spectra of e. coli and s. aureus showed no dependency on the type of growth medium, growth density, or incubation time.

TI  == synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. to investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (ctx), desacetylcefotaxime (des), and ofloxacin (ofl), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between ctx, des and ofl was demonstrable for 89 (81%). included in the study were 70 members of the enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of xanthomonas maltophilia. additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. organisms tested included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (10), enterococcus faecalis (10), and streptococcus pneumoniae (20). synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the bacteroides fragilis group. of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). isolates representative of each major group  of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == efficacies of abt-719 and related 2-pyridones, members of a new class of antibacterial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  == the 2-pyridones are a new class of broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antibacterial agents. these compounds are potent bacterial dna gyrase inhibitors  which differ from fluoroquinolones by placement of the nitrogen atom in the ring  juncture. abt-719 is an s isomer and a representative 2-pyridone. abt-719 administered orally or subcutaneously was 4- to 10-fold more effective than ciprofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes infections in normal mice. abt-719 was equivalent in efficacy to ciprofloxacin for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa or escherichia coli. the racemate and r forms of abt-719 produced similar results against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. the 50% effective doses of abt-719 were at least threefold  lower than those of ciprofloxacin for therapy of intracellular infections caused  by salmonella typhimurium or listeria monocytogenes. in immunosuppressed mice, abt-719 was more effective than ciprofloxacin against quinolone-sensitive s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium. the pharmacokinetic properties of abt-719 were consistent with its relative efficacy. the 2-pyridones are potent, orally available antibacterial agents with efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections in mice.

AB  == antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (sbt/abpc) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and mics of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. the ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (dmppc)-susceptible staphylococcus aureus subsp.  aureus (mssa), about 80% of dmppc-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), 100% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, 95% of moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of haemophilus influenzae.  several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc against beta-lactamase producing strains of mssa, m. (b.)  catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and almost all of enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc) and piperacillin (pipc), but antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were weak against mrsa and cephems (ceps)-resistant strains detected in some of enterobacteriaceae. 3. it appeared that benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive streptococcus pneumoniae (pisp) or pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) and ceps-resistant escherichia coli increased  year by year. 4. antimicrobial activities of sbt/abpc were strong against streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, m. (b.) catarrhalis and h. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of sbt was observed against beta-lactamase produced by s. aureus and k. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. thus, sbt/abpc is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness,  especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.

TI  == development of a direct viable count procedure for some gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the direct viable count (dvc) is a procedure for enumerating viable-nonculturable cells. it should be noted, however, that bacteria demonstrating the viable but nonculturable phase have to date included only gram-negative species, mainly because the dvc procedure does not lend itself to the analysis of gram-positive bacteria since the dvc procedure is dependent on the bacterium being sensitive to nalidixic acid. the authors report here concerning studies on an analogous procedure for the direct enumeration of viable-nonculturable gram-positive bacteria. to facilitate a differential dvc for gram-positive bacteria, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin or isopropyl cinodine were substituted for nalidixic acid. these antibiotics were chosen because, like nalidixic acid, they  are dna gyrase inhibitors. the concentrations used for each antibiotic were 1000  micrograms ml-1, 100 micrograms ml-1. pure cultures of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus agalactiae, listeria monocytogenes and bacillus subtilis were obtained from the culture collection at the university of  wyoming and a faecal streptococcus was isolated from the laramie wastewater treatment plant. an antibiotic and optimal concentration thereof was found which  gave enlarged cells for all the organisms except the faecal streptococcus isolated from the wastewater plant for which no enlarged cells were ever seen. the antibiotic and concentration thereof which gave the optimal percent enlarged  cells in the dvc procedure varied between organisms.

TI  == prevalence and antibiotic sensitivity of danish versus other european bacterial isolates from intensive care and hematology/oncology units.
AB  == the prevalence and antibiotic sensitivity patterns of bacteria collected consecutively from medical and surgical intensive care units (icus) and from hematology/oncology units in nine hospitals in denmark were determined and compared to data collected simultaneously in 12 other european countries. bacterial isolates from 794 danish patients were tested and compared to 8,625 isolates from european patients. the minimal inhibitory concentrations of eight different antibiotics were determined using a microdilution plate. similar to findings in european countries, the most common source of bacterial isolates in danish units was the respiratory tract (49%), followed by blood (18%), urinary tract (14%) and surgical wounds (10%). staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent respiratory organism in danish units, whereas enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa dominated in other countries. in blood, escherichia coli was most prevalent in denmark while coagulase-negative staphylococci were predominant in other countries. urinary tract isolates were dominated by escherichia coli in both denmark and the other countries, but enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa were more frequently isolated in the other countries. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent wound isolate in denmark,  while enterobacteriaceae other than escherichia coli dominated in other european  countries. thus, in denmark escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus, followed  by pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella spp. (from icus) or enterococcus spp. and klebsiella spp. (from hematology/oncology units), are the most prominent pathogens in these units today. indicator organisms of antibiotic consumption (pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus) were more frequent in other european countries than denmark. in general the danish isolates were more sensitive to antibiotics than the european isolates.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == development of wound infection or separation after cesarean delivery. prospective evaluation of 2,431 cases.
AB  == wound infections are a common surgical complication, often requiring a prolonged  hospital stay and leading to increased costs. over a one-year period, 2,431 patients were followed after cesarean delivery with prompt evaluation and culture of all suspicious wounds. seventy subjects (2.8%) developed confirmed wound infection, and 42 (1.7%) developed noninfected open surgical wounds. seven (0.3%) fascial dehiscences were diagnosed, requiring surgical repair. forty of 63 (64%)  infected wounds had positive bacterial cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis  (29%), enterococcus faecalis (17%), staphylococcus aureus (17%), escherichia coli (11%) and proteus mirabilis (10%) the most frequent isolates. only 7 of 42 (17%)  noninfected wounds had positive cultures, with only s aureus, s epidermidis and corynebacterium species isolated. ninety-five percent of the noninfected wounds had blood or serous collections present. rupture of membranes lasting longer than six hours, emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity were associated with a  statistically increased likelihood of the development of infected wounds. emergency cesarean delivery and morbid obesity, but not prolonged rupture of membranes, were associated with an increased likelihood of the development of noninfected wounds. therefore, it appears that at least two mechanisms are responsible for the development of postcesarean open wounds: (1) increased amniotic fluid and wound colonization due to prolonged rupture of membranes, resulting in a wound infection containing one or more bacterial species derived from the cervicovaginal flora, and (2) increased exogenous bacterial contamination and flora consistent with skin species or breaks in sterile technique, often accompanying difficult or emergency surgery.

TI  == [nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1991. in this study, identifications and susceptibility  testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and cns showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (dmppc). streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to  many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. though enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (abpc), piperacillin (pipc), imipenem (ipm), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (st) compounds, enterococcus faecium was resistant  to almost all antibacterial agents but to st compounds. high susceptibility rates were observed for strains of enterobacter cloacae to ipm, gentamicin (gm) and ofloxacin (oflx) and for strains of proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (lmox), ipm, aztreonam (azt), gm and oflx. serratia marcescens and bacteroides fragilis group  were highly susceptible only to ipm. pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (caz), ipm, amikacin (amk) and tobramycin (tob). pseudomonas cepacia  was relatively susceptible only to caz. ipm showed strong antibacterial activity  to many species except for s. aureus and cns.

AB  == mechanisms of resistance of strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, neisseria meningitidis and mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics are presented and discussed. the resistance to methicillin-oxacillin in s. aureus and s. epidermidis is chromosomally-mediated by sequence of dna, namely by gene meca. this gene codes altered pbp-2a protein. strains of s.pneumoniae contain pbp-1a, pbp-2b and pbp-2x proteins. they cause resistance to many beta-lactam antibiotics. resistance to vankomycin, respectively to teikoplanin in strains of  e. faecalis and e. faecium is coded by transferable vana and vanb genes. strains  of n. meningitidis produce mostly the altered pbp-2 protein. the increase of resistance in strains of m. tuberculosis is also significant.

AB  == the initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (csh) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". in the present study, the csh of 133 strains of enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, group a streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus magnus, and of 8 candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% co2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate csh, i.e., they aggregated in  0.01-2 m ammonium sulfate. when the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher  csh, and 44 strains the same csh as after growth without serum. the csh of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and pdm  agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% co2 atmosphere. the highest csh was expressed after growth in 5% co2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 c, 20 min) serum. the reduced surface tension obtained in 5% co2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of csh.

TI  == glycopeptides in the treatment of staphylococcal infections.

AB  == to assess the most relevant features of hospital-acquired endocarditis, we conducted a retrospective study of cases of infectious endocarditis at a single university hospital from 1978 through 1992. during this period 248 episodes of infectious endocarditis were documented; 23 (9.3%) of these episodes were hospital-acquired and were not associated with cardiac surgery. (this figure represented a remarkable rise in the frequency of nosocomial endocarditis, only one case of which was identified among 101 cases of endocarditis treated at the same institution between 1960 and 1975.) in each of the 23 nosocomial cases, endocarditis was the result of bacteremia associated with a hospital-based procedure: intravenous catheterization (15 cases), instrumentation of a diseased  urogenital tract (seven cases), or liver biopsy (one case). staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis were the predominant organisms isolated from intravenous catheters and the urogenital tract, respectively. two of seven enterococcal isolates were highly resistant to gentamicin (mic, > 2,000 micrograms/ml). overall mortality was 56%. two subsets of at-risk patients with different anatomic and clinical manifestations were identified. our results emphasize that infectious endocarditis must be considered a serious nosocomial hazard against which preventive measures must be implemented.

TI  == characterization of an erythromycin resistance (erm) plasmid in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == three erythromyxin-resistant swedish isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, representing different t-types, were studied. two of the strains showed constitutive high-level (mic > 200 micrograms/ml) and one showed moderate (mic 6.4 micrograms/ml) resistance; the latter strain was sensitive to lincosamide and clindamycin, and resistance was not induced by erythromycin. in each of the strains, a plasmid with an estimated mw of 17.6 +/- 0.9 x 10(6) was isolated in addition to smaller cryptic plasmids. the three plasmids pse701, pse702, and pse703 had very similar restriction enzyme cleavage patterns. novobiocin curing of the high-level resistance strain er559 showed the resistance to be linked to its 17.6 x 10(6) plasmid, pse703. furthermore, by electroporation this rather large plasmid was reintroduced into an erythromycin-sensitive cured derivative, acquiring resistance, and the plasmid was again recovered from the transconjugant. one of the plasmids, pse702, was shown by filter mating to be conjugative within s. pyogenes. dna-dna hybridization showed that the resistance  determinant of the present three isolates was related to the erm gene on plasmid  pam beta 1 of enterococcus faecalis but not to that of plasmid pe194 of staphylococcus aureus. the copy numbers of pse702 and pse703, derived from the two high-level resistant strains, were 11 +/- 3 and 17 +/- 5 compared to 2 +/- 1  for pse701, derived from the moderately resistant strain, possibly accounting for the phenotypic variation observed. the plasmids pse702 and pam beta 1 showed about 80% homology in dna-dna hybridization tests and high similarity in their restriction maps.

TI  == [clinical study of a new injectable cephem, fk037, for acute bacterial prostatitis].
AB  == fk037, a new injectable cephem antibiotic, was administered in the treatment of 13 acute bacterial prostatitis (mean age 53.5, range 30-79), and its effectiveness and safety were evaluated. the human prostatic fluid (pf) concentration of fk037 on 7 specimens 1 hour after 1 g i.v.d., was in the range of 0.87-7.47 micrograms/ml (mean +/- sd, 3.43 +/- 2.23 micrograms/ml), whereas, the serum concentration averaged 45.3 +/- 2.88 micrograms/ml, the ratio of pf/serum consequently being 0.08 +/- 0.05. in the clinical study, 1g of fk037 was administered to 13 patients by i.v.d. twice a day for 7-9 days. bacteriological eradication on expressed prostatic secretion (eps) was obtained for all clinical  isolates which included 11 strains of escherichia coli (mic < or = 0.05 microgram/ml), 2 of enterococcus faecalis, and each one of staphylococcus aureus  and morganella morganii. symptomatical cure was 100% in all cases. as for safety  profile, no side effects were noted. in laboratory values, slight elevation of transaminase were detected in 3 cases, but they were transient and returned to normal 1-2 weeks after completion of the therapy. we conclude that fk037 is highly effective in the treatment of acute bacterial prostatitis, and is well tolerated in comparison with other relative antimicrobials.

TI  == positive inotropic effect of streptococcus faecalis in isolated cardiac muscle.
AB  == infective endocarditis is caused by bacterial colonization of the endocardium. because endocardium modulates mechanical performance of subjacent myocardium, we  studied acute effects of bacteria on isolated cardiac muscle and on the functional role of the endocardium. bacteria, grown in broth at 37 degrees c, were added at increasing concentrations (10(2) to 10(6) bacteria/ml) to cat papillary muscles in krebs-ringer solution (1.25 mm ca2+, 35 degrees c). the endocardial surface was damaged by exposing muscles to a stream of dry air for 30 s. streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis induced significant increases in total peak isometric twitch tension (tt) and maximal velocity of unloaded shortening (vmax) and significant decreases in time to tt (tttt) and time to half isometric  twitch tension decline (rt 1/2), both before and after removal of endocardial endothelium. this response could also be elicited with bacterial filtrate, after  boiling the filtrate or after extracting the polysaccharides from it with kio4. increasing ca2+ concentrations progressively reduced the response to the filtrate. propranolol slightly, although not significantly, diminished the effects on tt and vmax while abolishing the effects on tttt and on rt 1/2. by contrast, streptococcus bovis and staphylococcus aureus did not affect tt or vmax but induced a slight but significant decrease in tttt at the highest concentration of bacteria. accordingly, the filtrate of strep. faecalis induces a positive inotropic effect. the active component is neither a protein nor a polysaccharide, and its effect may be partly beta-adrenoceptor mediated. strep. bovis and staph. aureus have negligible acute effects on contractility.

TI  == pacemaker endocarditis. report of 44 cases and review of the literature.
AB  == we conducted a retrospective study to characterize the clinical course, microbiologic spectrum, and risk factors for endocarditis and for associated mortality in a large series of patients with documented pacemaker endocarditis. using a computerized search through the medical records of 10 major hospitals in  israel from 1982 to 1992, and carefully reviewing the charts, we identified 44 patients with pacemaker endocarditis. the cases were categorized as definite (n = 25), probable (n = 12), or possible (n = 7) infective endocarditis based on strict case definition. fever and chills were the most common symptoms. increased esr, leukocytosis, microscopic hematuria, and anemia were the most common laboratory findings. a relatively high proportion of the patients were diabetic.  the most common source of endocarditis was infection acquired by the placement procedure or infection of the pacemaker pouch. demographic, clinical, and laboratory features were similar to those of endocarditis patients of a similar age range without pacemakers, although the frequency of fever and chills was higher in our patients than in those patients and splenomegaly, vascular embolic  phenomena, and new or changing murmurs were rare in our patients. the major pathogens were staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, similar to other series of pacemaker-associated bacteremia and similar to the microbiologic  findings of early prosthetic-valve endocarditis. however, this microbiologic profile is different from that of native-valve endocarditis. although the present series did not show a statistically significant advantage to electrode removal over conservative treatment, when analyzed together with pooled data from other studies, it suggests that the surgical approach is preferable.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefozopran in the pediatric field].
AB  == cefozopran (czop, sce-2787), a newly developed parenteral cephem antibiotic, was  administered to children with bacterial infections. we determined its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety in these patients.  1. antibacterial activity mics of cefmetazole, ceftazidime, cefuzonam, flomoxef and czop were determined against a total of 19 strains. for gram-positive cocci,  mics of czop ranged from 0.39 to 0.78 microgram/ml against staphylococcus aureus  (3 strains), from 0.05 to 6.25 micrograms/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae (5  strains), and 12.5 micrograms/ml against enterococcus faecalis (1 strain). these  mics were generally similar to those of other cephems, but the mic of czop against e. faecalis was lower than those of the other cephems examined. for gram-negative bacilli, mics of czop were 25 micrograms/ml against citrobacter freundii (1 strain), and 6.25 micrograms/ml against pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 strain). these values were similar to or lower than those of other cephems, mics  of czop against haemophilus influenzae (7 strains) ranged from 0.1 to 0.39 microgram/ml. however, the mic of czop against serratia marcescens (1 strain) was higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and czop was as ineffective as the other cephems against this organism. 2. pharmacokinetics czop was administered to children at 20 or 40 mg/kg via intravenous injection, and determinations were made for its serum concentrations, urinary concentrations and concentrations in cerebrospinal  fluid (csf) using the bioassay. serum concentrations at 30 minutes after administration were 60.4 micrograms/ml with a dose of 20 mg/kg to one patient and 93.9 and 99.0 micrograms/ml with 40 mg/kg to two patients. the corresponding half-lives were 1.55 hours for 20 mg/kg administration, and 1.10 and 3.41 hours for 40 mg/kg, while the aucs were 136.5 micrograms.hr/ml for 20 mg/kg, and 194.4  and 264.5 micrograms.hr/ml for 40 mg/kg. the rates of urinary recovery in the first 8 hours after administration were 45.0% in the patient receiving 20 mg/kg,  and 84.6 and 97.6% in the two patients receiving 40 mg/kg. the concentrations in  the csf determined in 3 patients with purulent meningitis ranged from 2.6 to 16.0 micrograms/ml 1 hour after administration, and the csf/serum concentration ratio  ranged from 6.5 to 39.0%. these values for pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in the bioassay were similar to those obtained using hplc. 3. clinical evaluation forty-eight patients were clinically evaluated. of these patients, 75% were less  than 3 years of age and there were slightly more male children than female children.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == cloning, sequencing and expression in escherichia coli of the low-affinity penicillin binding protein of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == low-affinity penicillin binding proteins are particular membrane proteins, in several gram-positive bacteria, which are involved in beta-lactam antibiotic resistance. the structural gene for the low-affinity penicillin binding protein 5 (pbp5) of enterococcus faecalis was cloned and sequenced. from the sequence of the 3378 bp, a 2040 bp coding region was identified. from biochemical analysis it emerges that e. faecalis pbp5 is a type ii membrane protein with an uncleaved n-terminal and is composed of 679 amino acids with a molecular weight of 74055. this protein showed 48 and 33% of identity with enterococcus hirae pbp5 and staphylococcus aureus pbp2a, both low-affinity pbps involved in beta-lactam resistance. anti-pbp5 antibodies cross-reacted with a membrane protein present in other species of enterococci, but the entire gene fragment cloned hybridized only with dnas of e. faecalis strains, thus suggesting that genes coding for low-affinity pbps of enterococci are not strictly homologous. in this experiment  digoxigenin-labelled e. faecalis dna was used.

AB  == recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high  incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. at first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of dna extraction. n-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract  dna from e. faecalis, e. faecium and s. aureus, respectively. after achromopeptidase extraction, the meca gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in clinically isolated mrsa (95 strains), mssa (66), mrse (methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 37), msse (methicillin-sensitive s. epidermidis, 1), s haemolyticus(5), s.hominis(1) and others (enterococcus, pseudomonas, and streptococcus, total 45). pcr products were analyzed by agarose  gel electrophoresis. the positive rates were 95% (mrsa), 1.5% (mssa), and 97% (mrse). the meca gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant s.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive s.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.hominis. the meca gene was not detected in 45 non-staphylococcal strains. meca and fema gene by pcr and pbp 2' by irma were further detected in newly isolated mrsa (20 strains), mssa(20), mrse(14), msse(1) and s.simulans(2). complete correlation between mpipc susceptibility and meca were found. the fema gene was positive in 39/40 of s. aureus, and 0/14 of s.epidermidis, 2/3 of s.simulans. pbp2' were positive in 20/20 of mrsa, 0/20 of mssa, 14/14 of mrse, 0/1 of msse, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant s.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive s.simulans. in conclusion, diagnoses of mrsa by simultaneous detection of meca and fema gene as well as pbp2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.

TI  == in-vitro activity of four new fluoroquinolones.
AB  == the in-vitro activities of four new fluoroquinolones, e-4749, e-4874, e-4884 and  e-4904, were compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 1106 clinical isolates. against majority of enterobacteriaceae, general antibacterial  activities of e-4749 (mic90s 0.06-1 mg/l), e-4874 (mic90s, 0.03-0.25 mg/l) and e-4884 (mic90s 0.01-0.5 mg/l) were comparable or slightly lower than those of ciproloxacin (mic90s 0.01-0.25 mg/l) and sparfloxacin (mic90s 0.01-1 mg/l). the activity of e-4904 (mic90s 0.06-2 mg/l) was lower than those of its analogues. most of the escherichia coli which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mic > or = 2  mg/l) and serratia spp., were resistant to the new fluoroquinolones. beta-lactamase producing strains of moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible to these compounds (mics < or = 0.008 mg/l). most of pseudomonas aeruginosa, non-aeruginosa pseudomonas spp., xanthomonas maltophilia, and acinetobacter spp.  were resistant to the new quinolones (mic90s 8- > 16 mg/l). on the contrary, these new antimicrobials were active against the majority of the aeromonas spp. (mic90s < or = 0.5 mg/l). e-4749, e-4874, e-4884 and e-4904 remained active (mic90s < or = 0.25 mg/l) against staphylococcus aureus strains susceptible to methicillin. however, its activity was two- to eight-fold lower than that of ciprofloxacin (mic90 0.03 mg/l) and sparfloxacin (mic90 0.06 mg/l). against s. aureus resistant to methicillin or ciprofloxacin, activity of these new compounds and comparators agents, was very low (mic90s 2- > 16 mg/l). most of the strains of enterococcus faecalis were resistant (mic90s > 16 mg/l). the activity of e-4874, e-4904 and sparfloxacin (mic90 1 mg/l for each one) was higher than that  of the rest of the agents tested. e-4874 (mic90 0.25 mg/l) was four-fold more active than the other antibacterials tested (mic90 2 mg/l) against listeria monocytogenes. no new quinolone was active against bacteroides fragilis (mic90s 4-16 mg/l), bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (mic90s 8- > 16 mg/l), and other b. fragilis group (mic90s 16- > 16 mg/l). ciprofloxacin (mic90s > 16 mg/l), and sparfloxacin (mic90s 8-16 mg/l) also were inactive. e-4874 (mic90 4 mg/l) was the most active quinolone tested against b.fragilis.

AB  == biapenem (l-627) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in 27 children with various bacterial infections. l-627 was effective in cases with osteomyelitis due to staphylococcus aureus, pneumonia and purulent meningitis due to penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and urinary tract infections due to enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa. however, l-627 failed to produce good responses in 2 of 7 cases of haemophilus influenzae  infections. pharmacokinetic parameters of 30-minutes infusion of 12 mg/kg were as follows: cmax 29-46 micrograms/ml, t 1/2 0.68-0.94 hr. adverse reactions were minimal. these data suggest that l-627 is safe in children, and is valuable especially for treatment of infections in immunocompromised hosts and infections  due to multiply resistant bacteria.

AB  == a total of 195 strains of gram positive cocci isolated from urine, in pure culture and in counts of > 10(3) colony forming units/ml, during january-september 1992, were speciated using schema recently described by facklam and washington, and kloos and lambe. seventy three (85%) of the 86 enterococci were identified as enterococcus faecalis while 11 (13%) were e. faecium. eighteen (29%) of the 62 staphylococcal isolates were staphylococcus aureus; 20 (45%) of the 44 coagulase negative staphylococci were speciated as staph. haemolyticus. of the 47 strains of beta haemolytic streptococci isolated, 45 (96%) were group b; one was group g and the other group f. our results show the diverse species of gram positive cocci associated with bacteriuria and the need to speciate them in  a diagnostic laboratory. in the context of a larger number of tests required for  the speciation of gram positive cocci, we recommend a simplified scheme which we  found feasible on a routine basis.

TI  == determinations of minimum bactericidal concentrations, kill curves, and postantibiotic effects with the etest technology.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of antimicrobial agents is generally determined following broth dilution minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) procedures. these methods are cumbersome, require advanced technical experience, and lack proven reproducibility. etest (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) is a predefined antimicrobial gradient on a plastic carrier strip that is used to generate a precise mic on an agar plate. a pilot study was conducted to investigate whether  a drug's bactericidal effect could be assessed by transferring the "growth-inhibition pattern" from the etest mic ellipse onto a drug-free agar plate. the transfer was performed using four techniques of replica plating, a filter method, drug inactivation, and sampling of growth alongside the etest strip. defined antimicrobial-organism models were used to determine the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), killing curves (kcs), and postantibiotic effects (paes) of several drugs. preliminary results suggest that the etest provides an alternative method for studies determining the mbcs, kcs, and paes of various antimicrobial agents.

TI  == plasmids designed to alter the antibiotic resistance expressed by insertion mutations in bacillus subtilis, through in vivo recombination.
AB  == numerous insertion mutations conferring resistance to antibiotics are available in bacillus subtilis. however, many of them have been constructed in vitro by inserting genes from the staphylococcus aureus plasmids, pc194 or pe194, conferring resistance to chloramphenicol (cm) or erythromycin (er). others are insertions of the enterococcus faecalis tn917 transposon conferring resistance to er. this paucity of resistance markers has been limiting the possibilities of constructing and studying mutants carrying two or more of these mutations in the  past. we constructed plasmids which can be used to change the antibiotic resistance expressed by preexisting chromosomal insertions, through transformation and homologous recombination. these vectors replace the pre-existing resistance to cm or er with new resistances to neomycin (nm), phleomycin (pm), spectinomycin (sp) or tetracycline (tc).

TI  == contaminated rabbit patellar tendon grafts. in vivo analysis of disinfecting methods.
AB  == in part 1 of our study, 40 central-third bone-patellar tendon-bone grafts were harvested from 20 adult california white rabbits under strict sterile conditions. ten grafts were placed directly into a thioglycolate broth, incubated, and subcultured; no growth was noted in any specimen. the next 6 grafts were contaminated 20 seconds each with 2 different species of coagulase-negative staphylococci. organisms were grown with cultures obtained from an operating room floor during anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. marked growth of both species was noted in all 6 grafts within 24 hours. a subsequent 3 series of 8 grafts each were harvested sterilely, contaminated as described above, and soaked in 1 of 3 solutions 30 minutes before culture. both 10% povidone-iodine and a triple-antibiotic solution (gentamicin, clindamycin, polymyxin) were 100% ineffective as both organisms grew; 4% chlorhexidine gluconate effectively decontaminated 8 grafts in all cases. part 2 involved contamination of harvested  grafts with 5 common, virulent organisms: staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. elimination of all except klebsiella pneumoniae was successful with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate alone for 8 grafts. using a triple-antibiotic solution after chlorhexidine gluconate in 6 grafts eliminated this organism also.

TI  == molecular requirements for the inhibition of the tetracycline antiport protein and the effect of potent inhibitors on the growth of tetracycline-resistant bacteria.
AB  == forty-seven compounds and tetracycline (tc) structural analogues were tested for  their ability to interfere with [3h]tc uptake in everted inner membrane vesicles  derived from tc-resistant escherichia coli d1-209, bearing the class b tetracycline resistance efflux protein (tet protein). for effective inhibition of tc uptake, the molecule had to have an intact abcd tetracyclic carbon skeleton and a conjugated phenolic beta-diketone substructure at positions 10-12a with the subsequent development of keto-enol tautomerization. molecular variations at carbon positions 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 did not decrease, and some increased, the inhibitory activity as compared to that of tc. among these compounds, the highest inhibition of uptake occurred with certain position 6 and 13 derivatives  of 5-hydroxytetracycline. in a group of 13-(propylthio) derivatives of 5-oh-tc [13-propyl, 13-(3-chloropropyl), and 13-(2-carboxyethyl)] there was a correlation between uptake inhibitory activity and antibacterial activity. the 13-(3-chloropropyl) derivative, with the best efflux inhibitory activity, exhibited synergistic activity when tested in combination with doxycycline against tc-resistant e. coli bearing the class a or b determinant, against staphylococcus aureus bearing class k, and against enterococcus faecalis bearing  the class l determinant. the 13-propyl analogue also showed high transport blocking activity and showed synergistic antibacterial activity against e. coli bearing the class a determinant and additive activity against the other tc-resistant bacteria. the synergistic antibacterial activity of these compounds  was not shown by the 13-[(2-carboxyethyl)thio] homologue, whose efflux blocking activity was 70-fold less. these findings suggest that multiple sites on the tc molecule are available for synthetic modification toward the development of an effective tc blocking agent. such compounds, used alone or in combination with a  standard tetracycline, show improved antibacterial activity.

TI  == in vitro resistance to platelet microbicidal protein correlates with endocarditis source among bacteremic staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates.
AB  == traditionally, platelets have been thought to contribute to the induction and propagation of infective endocarditis (ie). however, recent studies suggest that  platelets may potentially mitigate ie via secretion of alpha-granule-derived platelet microbicidal protein (pmp). in this study, we compared the pmp susceptibility of bacteremic isolates from patients with and without ie. isolates of staphylococcus aureus (n = 17), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns; n = 28), viridans streptococci (vs; n = 54), and enterococcus faecalis (n = 20), each at a final inoculum of 2 x 10(3) cfu/ml, were exposed to pmp [100 u/ml, (5 micrograms/ml)] for 2 h, and the percent survival was determined. for s. aureus,  cns, and vs isolates, there was a significant correlation between an ie source and increased percent survival post-pmp exposure; the mean percent survivals of s. aureus, cns, and vs were significantly greater for ie versus non-ie isolates (p < 0.005 for each organism). no significant correlation was observed between the source of bacteremic e. faecalis isolates and pmp susceptibility. these data  suggest that staphylococcal and vs (but not enterococcal) resistance to pmp may facilitate either the induction or progression of ie.

TI  == cefepime: a new fourth-generation cephalosporin.
AB  == the chemistry, pharmacology, antimicrobial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage of cefepime are reviewed. fourth-generation cephalosporins, such as cefepime, have a quaternary nitrogen that is positively charged at the 3-position, providing the properties of a zwitterion. a 2-aminothiazolyl-acetamido group in the side chain at the 7-position with an alpha-oxyimino substitution may enhance stability against beta-lactamases by preventing the enzymes' approach to the main nucleus. cefepime may exert its antimicrobial effect by attaching to specific penicillin-binding proteins, disrupting cell-wall synthesis. cefepime has good activity against gram-positive  organisms, such as staphylococcus aureus, and gram-negative organisms, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa. cefepime is not active in vitro against enterococcus faecalis, clostridium difficile, and methicillin- and cefazolin-resistant staph.  aureus. cefepime's activity against gram-negative organisms is similar to that of most third-generation cephalosporins. the agent has poor activity against bacteroides species. the most common mechanism of resistance to cefepime is the excess production of beta-lactamases. maximum peak plasma concentrations are two  to three times higher after i.v. administration than after intramuscular administration. in healthy adults, the volume of distribution is 13-22 l and the  elimination half-life is 2-2.3 hours. clinical studies show that cefepime is as effective as cefotaxime or ceftazidime in patients with infections of the lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structures, urinary tract, or female reproductive system. cefepime reduces fever as effectively as ceftazidime or piperacillin plus gentamicin in neutropenic patients. the most common adverse effects of cefepime are headache (2.4%), nausea (1.8%), rash (1.8%), and diarrhea (1.7%). depending on creatinine clearance, the dosage of cefepime is 1000-2000 mg i.v. every 8-24 hours for life-threatening infections and 500-2000 mg i.v. every  12-24 hours for severe infections. cefepime's clinical efficacy is comparable to  that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime.

TI  == molecular characterization of a plasmid-borne (pgt633) erythromycin resistance determinant (ermgt) from lactobacillus reuteri 100-63.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri 100-63 contains a 9.8 kb plasmid (pgt633) encoding resistance to the macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (mls) type b antibiotics. the restriction endonucleases acci, bamhi, bcli, ecori, ecorv, hhai, hindii, hpai, kpni, sali, and sspi were employed to establish a physical map of pgt633. next, genetic transfer experiments were conducted to establish the host range of  pgt633. the results revealed that pgt633 replicated autonomously and encoded constitutive resistance to erythromycin in a variety of bacterial hosts, including bacillus subtilis bd170, streptococcus sanguis dl1, staphylococcus aureus rn4220, and enterococcus faecalis 19433, as well as several lactobacillus  spp. a 2.2 kb bamhi fragment of pgt633 containing the genetic determinant (ermgt) encoding resistance to erythromycin was cloned into escherichia coli. determination of the nucleotide sequence of ermgt revealed a methylase gene 731 bp in length that was highly related (ca. 81% nucleotide and ca. 78% amino acid identity) to the ermc gene from s. aureus plasmid pe194. the leader sequences of  ermgt and ermc were identical except for a single base change at nt 51.

TI  == [in vitro antibacterial activities of broad spectrum quinolones against clinical  bacterial isolates].
AB  == in vitro activities of broad-spectrum quinolones (sparfloxacin (spfx), ciprofloxacin (cpfx), lomefloxacin (lflx), fleroxacin (flrx), and levofloxacin (lvfx) were examined against clinical bacterial isolates: klebsiella pneumoniae,  haemophilus influenzae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and streptococcus pneumoniae). antibacterial activities of spfx, cpfx, and lvfx against gram-negative bacteria such as k. pneumoniae, m. (b) catarrhalis and h. influenzae were better than those of flrx and lflx. spfx showed the highest activity against all gram-positive bacteria tested in this study. however, strains showed high mic (> or = 16 micrograms/ml) to spfx were found among mrsa,  e. faecalis, and e. faecium, whose isolation frequencies were 28.6%, 10.0%, and 6.7%, respectively. the results of this study suggest that resistant strains of gram-positive bacteria against new quinolone might increase among clinical isolates.

TI  == postantibiotic effect of du-6859a and levofloxacin as compared with ofloxacin.
AB  == the postantibiotic effect (pae) was determined for two of the newer fluoroquinolones: du-6859a and levofloxacin. all drugs (including ofloxacin control) had good pae activity against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. only du-6859a had pae test conditions (< or = 0.5 mu/ml) that coincided with achievable clinical concentrations for all organisms tested. these data indicate that levofloxacin, like ofloxacin (paes, 1.0-2.9 h), could be administered once or twice daily and that the dosing of du-6859a (paes, 1.6-2.4 h) might be extended to once every 24 h because of its documented pae and its potency advantages as compared with levofloxacin and ofloxacin.

TI  == characterization of a tn925-induced mutant of staphylococcus aureus altered in exoprotein production.
AB  == an insertional mutant was isolated from a bovine staphylococcus aureus strain after membrane-mating with a streptococcus faecalis strain carrying conjugative plasmid pcf10::tn925. this mutant, designated rc128, showed enhanced production of alpha-hemolysin and proteases and decreased production of coagulase, extracellular protein a, dnase, lipase and delta-hemolysin. no difference was found in the production of beta-hemolysin. both, southern blot analysis and transfer of the pleiotropic mutant phenotype by transduction, indicated that the  mutation was originated from a single insertion of transposon tn925. the ld50 determined by intraperitoneal administration in mice showed that mutant rc128 was slightly less virulent than its parental strain.

TI  == prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in europe. study group 'bacterial resistance' of the paul-ehrlich-society for chemotherapy e. v.
AB  == since 1984, when the first fluoroquinolone, norfloxacin, was marketed in europe,  there has been a marked increase in the usage of this class of drugs. in order to evaluate the influence of this drug usage on the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in clinical isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococcus faecalis we reviewed the susceptibility data from four collaborative surveys conducted between 1983 and 1990 by the study group 'bacterial resistance' of the paul-ehrlich-society for chemotherapy. all participating laboratories used the same standardized methods. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the broth microdilution method. more than 20,000 bacterial strains were tested. the results are presented for ciprofloxacin, which is regarded as the representative of the fluoroquinolones. using > or = 4 mg/l as a breakpoint for resistance to ciprofloxacin, the prevalence of resistant strains of the family enterobacteriaceae in central europe between 1983 and 1990 remained below 1%. in contrast, the resistance rates in p. aeruginosa were 0.7%, 1.0%, 3.8% and 7.0%, in s. aureus 0%, 0.5%, 6.6% and  6.8%, and in e. faecalis 2.2%, 0.7%, 4.9% and 7.7% in 1983, 1986, 1989 and 1990,  respectively. the latest study carried out in cooperation with 78 laboratories from 12 european countries revealed great differences in the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones from one species to another ranging from 0% with proteus vulgaris and salmonella spp. to 26.7% with providencia stuartii.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == residual bacterial contamination on reusable pulse oximetry sensors.
AB  == background: an early study demonstrated that standard cleaning techniques did not adequately disinfect reusable pulse oximetry sensors that had been intentionally  contaminated with high titers of pathogenic microorganisms. this current study evaluated patient-ready sensors being used in hospitals, by testing them for bacterial contamination. methods: reusable pulse oximetry sensors from 15 hospitals throughout the united states were tested. each sensor was deemed by the hospital to be ready for patient use, and it had been prepared for use according  to hospital procedures. patient-contact areas of each sensor were swabbed, and the swabs were analyzed for bacterial contamination using standard testing procedures. this study had two stages, and different sensors were tested in each  stage. in the "bacterial-growth stage," swabs were evaluated for bacterial contamination but organisms were not identified; in the "identification stage," bacterial species were identified. results: forty-four sensors were evaluated, 16 in the bacterial-growth stage and 28 in the identification stage. bacteria were cultured from 29 of the 44 sensors (66%), including 20 that had been cleaned with alcohol or an antibacterial/antiviral agent. among the isolated organisms were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, enterococcus faecalis, and klebsiella oxytoca. bacterial contamination was found on sensors from 12 of the 15 participating hospitals. conclusions: these data demonstrate the need to define effective cleaning methods for reusable sensors, and we are currently conducting such studies. the data also suggest that disposable patient-dedicated  sensors may be the most appropriate choice when infection control is of particular concern.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of the glycylcyclines, a new class  of semisynthetic tetracyclines.
AB  == n,n-dimethylglycylamido (dmg) derivatives of minocycline and 6-demethyl-6-deoxytetracycline are new semisynthetic tetracyclines referred to as the glycylcyclines. the in vitro activities of the glycylcyclines were evaluated  in comparison with those of minocycline and tetracycline against strains carrying characterized tetracycline resistance determinants and against 995 recent clinical isolates obtained from geographically distinct medical centers in north  america. the glycylcyclines were active against tetracycline-resistant strains carrying efflux [tet(a), tet(b), tet(c), and tet(d) in escherichia coli and tet(k) in staphylococcus aureus] and ribosomal protection [tet(m) in s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and e. coli)] resistance determinants. potent activity (mic for 90% of strains, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) was obtained with the glycylcyclines against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant s. aureus, e. faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and various streptococcal species. the glycylcyclines exhibited good activity against a wide diversity of gram-negative  aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, most of which were less susceptible to minocycline and tetracycline. the activities of the glycylcyclines against most organisms tested were comparable to each other. the in vivo efficacies of the glycylcyclines against acute lethal infections in mice when dosed intravenously were reflective of their in vitro activities. the glycylcyclines had efficacies comparable to that of minocycline against infections with methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, a strain carrying tet(k), and a tetracycline-susceptible e. coli strain but exceeded the effectiveness of minocycline against infections with resistant isolates, including strains harboring tet(m) or tet(b). levels of dmg-6-deoxytetracycline in serum were higher and more sustained than those of dmg-minocycline or minocycline. our results show that the glycylcyclines have potent in vitro activities against a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including many resistant strains. on the basis of their in vitro and in vivo activities, the glycylcyclines represent a significant advance to the tetracycline class of antibiotics and have good potential value for clinical efficacy.

AB  == in enterococci, the structural gene for beta-lactamase (blaz) is identical to blaz from staphylococcus aureus. however, in the enterococci studied to date, beta-lactamase is produced constitutively, whereas in staphylococci it is often inducible. recent reports have revealed the presence of two adjacent genes upstream of the staphylococcal blaz thought to be the antirepressor (blar1) and repressor (blai) genes. in the present study, beta-lactamase expression mutants of the staphylococcal beta-lactamase plasmid pi524 were generated by transposon mutagenesis with the transposon tn917. tn917 insertions upstream of blaz in either blar1 or blai resulted in constitutive beta-lactamase production, indicating that the repressor function is lost with insertion of tn917 into either gene. this finding supports the concept that the staphylococcal beta-lactamase regulatory genes are encoded on a polycistronic mrna. the corresponding region upstream of the enterococcal blaz from enterococcus faecalis hh22 was sequenced and compared with the staphylococcal blar1 sequence. the two sequences were identical for 893 nucleotides, and then the sequences diverged completely. therefore, in strain hh22, only 51% of the putative antirepressor gene is present and the repressor gene is also absent. in conclusion, constitutive beta-lactamase production in hh22 appears to be due to a lack of the regulatory genes blar1 and blai which regulate expression of blaz in staphylococci.

TI  == diagnosis and treatment of enterococcal endocarditis.
AB  == enterococci are frequently encountered in urinary, biliary, and gastrointestinal  tract infections and are increasingly being recognized in nosocomial bacteriuria  and bacteremia. undoubtedly, however, the most serious of all enterococcal infections is endocarditis. at present, enterococci are the third most common cause of infective endocarditis (after streptococci and staphylococcus aureus), and the incidence of the disease is likely to grow as the population ages and increasing numbers of persons are placed at risk by degenerative valve disease and by predisposition to enterococcal infections through portals such as the genitourinary tract. the case presented here exemplifies many features of enterococcal endocarditis. it also illustrates the therapeutic issues and dilemmas faced in managing this disorder. although a transesophageal approach (figure 1) has increased the sensitivity of echocardiography for detecting valvular abnormalities in infective endocarditis, diagnosis continues to rely on  blood cultures--which raises the question of how long antimicrobial therapy should be delayed for collection of blood samples. since enterococcal isolates are often resistant to antibiotics, therapy is based on synergistic drug combinations.

TI  == multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the british isles.
AB  == twenty-nine british and irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. the organisms were identified by an appropriate api system or, for staphylococci, by their gram and coagulase reactions. disc susceptibility tests were performed. isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of mic, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. over 95% of the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiellae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus, moraxella and bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella and serratia group. tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against e. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), p. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). occasional (18%) resistance in enterobacter, serratia and citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of class i beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam.  high resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for enterococcus faecium and xanthomonas maltophilia. tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/l piperacillin/tazobactam in mic  tests. similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. amongst  the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. however, acinetobacter and bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. cefuroxime, ampicillin and  co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.

TI  == effect of prestorage white cell reduction on bacterial growth in platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates stored with and without autologous white cells were produced from units of whole blood that had been purposefully contaminated with bacteria immediately after phlebotomy. the blood was inoculated with one of five  species of bacterium at either 10 or 50 colony-forming units per ml. the growth of the organisms was quantified throughout the conventional 5-day, 22 degrees c storage period of the platelet concentrates. one species, klebsiella pneumoniae,  failed to grow in any of the components. the remaining species, staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and salmonella enteritidis, achieved log growth after 1 day of storage and reached a relative maximum concentration by day 3. although the concentration of bacteria immediately after  inoculation was lower in the units reduced in white cells by filtration, no significant differences were observed thereafter. data from this in vitro study support the concept that prestorage white cell reduction of platelet concentrates should not increase the likelihood of transfusion-induced septicemia.

AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout japan from september to december in both 1989 and 1990. in this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. the susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by nccls. staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but streptococcus pyogenes  and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (ipm) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. haemophilus influenzae, escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to ipm and aminoglycosides. bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to ipm. ipm had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (cam) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, moraxella, haemophilus and bacteroides  strains. mics80's of cam against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. mics80's against moraxella catarrhalis and haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. laboratory-induced resistance to cam in strains of s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. adherence to silicon filter of strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa or s. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-mic of cam or other macrolides. although tosufloxacin (tflx) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of p. aeruginosa strains tested, tflx showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-mics of cam or erythromycin.

TI  == synthetic bactericidal peptide based on cap37: a 37-kda human neutrophil granule-associated cationic antimicrobial protein chemotactic for monocytes.
AB  == cap37 (cationic antimicrobial protein of molecular mass 37 kda) is a multifunctional protein isolated from the granules of human neutrophils. it is antibiotic and chemotactic and binds lipopolysaccharide. a synthetic peptide, amino acid sequence nqgrhfcggaliharfvmtaascfq, based on residues 20-44 of cap37 protein mimics its antibiotic and lipopolysaccharide binding action. peptide 20-44, at the concentrations tested, has antibacterial activity against salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. the bactericidal action of the peptide was ph dependent, with maximum activity at ph 5.0 and ph 5.5 and decreased activity at ph 7.0. various truncations, substitutions, and other modifications in the sequence deteriorate its activity. free sulfhydryl groups and/or disulfide bridge formation are required for optimum antibiotic activity, since substitution of serines for, or alkylation of, cysteine residues 26 and 42 eliminates bactericidal activity. evidently amino acids 20-44 represent an important, perhaps principal, antibacterial domain of cap37. this peptide should provide new insight into the mechanism of antimicrobial activity of cap37 and may serve as a  model for new, useful, synthetic antibiotics.

AB  == the sensitivity of elongation factor tu (ef-tu) from different species of bacteria to the ef-tu-binding antibiotics efrotomycin, pulvomycin and mdl 62879 was tested by measuring the effect of these antibiotics on cell-free protein synthesis systems. ef-tu from four different gram-negative species was sensitive  to all three antibiotics. among gram-positive bacteria, ef-tu of bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis was resistant to efrotomycin and less sensitive to pulvomycin than ef-tu of gram-negative bacteria. ef-tus from streptococci were significantly less sensitive than ef-tus  from gram-negative bacteria to both efrotomycin and pulvomycin. all of the ef-tus were sensitive to mdl 62879. the same sensitivity pattern emerged from gdp exchange assays, performed with partially purified ef-tu from different bacterial species and pure escherichia coli ef-ts. these results suggest that the site of action of mdl 62879 is more conserved among bacterial species than those of efrotomycin and pulvomycin. heterogeneity of ef-tus from different bacterial species was also reflected in differences in their apparent molecular masses estimated by sds-page. ef-tus from the gram-positive species had higher molecular masses than those from all but one of the gram-negative species.

TI  == identification, characterization, and nucleotide sequence of a region of enterococcus faecalis pheromone-responsive plasmid pad1 capable of autonomous replication.
AB  == a 5-kbp region of pad1, previously shown to be capable of supporting replication, copy control, and stable inheritance of the plasmid, was cloned into a replicon probe vector and subjected to transposon insertional mutagenesis. transposon inserts identifying essential replication, copy control, and stability functions  were isolated. deletion of stability functions not essential for replication resulted in delimitation of a basic replicon. the complete dna sequence of this approximately 3-kbp region and the precise positions of several transposon inserts were determined, and the phenotypic effects of the transposon inserts were correlated with the physical locations of individual determinants. the following three genes, apparently involved in plasmid maintenance, were identified; repa, which encodes a protein required for replication; repb, which encodes a protein involved in copy control; and repc, which may be involved in stable inheritance. in addition, two clusters of repeats composed of a consensus  sequence, tagtarrr, were identified, one located between the divergently transcribed repa and repb genes and another located downstream of repc. the region between repa and repb contained 25 repeats divided into two subregions of  13 and 12 repeats separated by 78 bp. the region located downstream of repc contained only three repeats but may be essential for plasmid replication, since  deletion of this determinant resulted in loss of ability to replicate in enterococcus faecalis. we hypothesize that the repeat units represent protein-binding sites required for assembly of the replisome and control of plasmid copy number. another region of unrelated repeat units that may also be involved in replication is located within the repa gene. possible mechanisms of action of these determinants are discussed.

TI  == plasma level of antisecretory factor (asf) and its relation to post-weaning diarrhoea in piglets.
AB  == antisecretory factor (asf) is a regulatory peptide which counteracts diarrhoea in the pig; asf is rapidly absorbed from the pig intestine, and significantly reduces the incidence of neonatal diarrhoea in the suckling offspring. asf is synthesized in the central nervous system, and released to the blood stream via the pituitary gland. in two different experiments (n = 8 and n = 4), the blood concentration of asf was followed in 5-weeks old piglets from day 7 before weaning up to day 12 days after weaning. in both experiments asf concentrations were significantly (p < 0.01) lower on day three post-weaning, than either before weaning or on days 7 and 12 post-weaning. in another experiment, where plasma asf activity was determined in relation to clinical signs of diarrhoea seven days post-weaning, it was found to be 0.87 +/- 0.08 units/ml (mean +/- sem) in healthy weaners (n = 15), but only 0.22 +/- 0.05 units/ml in piglets suffering from diarrhoea (n = 15), the difference being significant. the faecal flora both of healthy weaners and of their matched controls suffering from diarrhoea were subjected to bacteriological examination before and after weaning, and found to be similar in both groups, namely a mixture of aerobic and anaerobic gram negative rods, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus/epidermidis, and enterococcus faecalis. no particular pathogen was predominant in any of the diseased animals.

AB  == to test the hypothesis that the use of protected specimen brushing (psb) via flexible bronchoscopy does not predispose to bacteremia in icu patients, we prospectively performed aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures immediately following bronchoscopy with psb. a total of 123 episodes in 68 consecutive patients with suspected pneumonia were analyzed. blood cultures were negative in  110 cases (89 percent) and positive in 13 cases (11 percent) (p < 0.001). twelve  of these 13 patients with positive blood cultures had quantitative psb specimen cultures showing nonsignificant growth (< 10(3) cfu/ml). in nine patients, the bacteria recovered from blood cultures (coagulase-negative staphylococci or sarcina) were considered nonpathogenic according to conventional criteria. blood  cultures grew a staphylococcus aureus in two patients with previously documented  staphylococcal septicemia. in one patient with no identifiable site of infection, the blood culture yielded enterococcus faecalis. the only patient with both a positive blood culture and psb culture results indicating pneumonia had different organisms recovered from the two samples. blood cultures taken after psb in the 17 other episodes of pneumonia (psb specimen cultures > or = 10(3) cfu/ml) were negative. at the time of brushing and blood sampling for culture, none of these patients was receiving antibiotics active on the organisms found. in conclusion,  the incidence of bacteremia after psb in icu patients seems very low even in patients with documented pneumonia. substantial savings would result from not performing routine blood cultures after psb.

AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == occurrence and mechanisms of glycopeptide resistance in gram-positive cocci.
AB  == despite belief that the unique mechanism of glycopeptide action would preclude the development of resistance in susceptible organisms, clinical isolates of enterococci and staphylococci resistant to these compounds have been described. among the enterococci, there are at least three types of resistance. type a (high-level) resistance was described in enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis. it is inducible and mediated by elaboration and/or increased activity of at least three enzymes: a ligase, a dehydrogenase, and a carboxypeptidase, which orchestrate the production of peptidoglycan precursors that do not bind vancomycin. type b (low-level) resistance described in e. faecium is also mediated by increased carboxypeptidase activity and, possibly, by elaboration of  a protein detectable after incubation in vancomycin whose function is unknown. type c resistance is associated with production of a ligase constitutively produced, chromosomally encoded, and unique to e. gallinarum. among the staphylococci, coagulase-negative clinical isolates were obtained that were resistant to glycopeptides and one coagulase-positive isolate was resistant to teicoplanin but the mechanism of resistance is unknown. additionally, coagulase-positive staphylococci resistant to glycopeptides have been prepared in the laboratory. they produce an approximately 39-kda cytoplasmic protein, whose function is unknown, and have undergone extensive reorganization of their cell surface. the era in which universal gram-positive susceptibility to glycopeptides can be presumed is over; susceptibility testing must now accompany isolation of an enterococcus or staphylococcus of clinical importance.

TI  == [the effect of culture media on bacteriocin production in various strains of bacteria].
AB  == some staphylococcus and enterococcus strains were used to investigate the effect  of culture medium on bacteriocin production. staphylococcus cohnii sc7, staphylococcus sp. ztj 151, s. saprophyticus ss 877, enterococcus faecium ef1 and e. faecalis efg2 were isolated from the rumen wall and contents of lambs, calves  and fallow deer, enterococcus gallinarum eg10 and e. avium ea12 were isolated from the caecum of japanese quail. the tested bacteria belong to producers with a wide antimicrobial effectiveness spectrum, they have low to medium adherence and  urease activity (tab. iii). these culture media were used to test the effect of culture medium on bacteriocin production: nutrient agar no. 2 and vl agar enriched with 2% of glucose and lactose (zag, zal, vlg, vll), agar for isolation  of faecal streptococci (sa) and the base for blood agar no. 4 and no. 2 (ka4, ka2). the strains streptococcus bovis ao 24/85 and staphylococcus aureus oxford 209 p were used as indicator bacteria. tables i and ii show the results of these  tests. the tested strains produced the widest inhibition zones (6 mm) with both indicators on sa medium, and this indicates massive bacteriocin production. on zag medium, the zones of enterococci with the ao 24/85 strain were larger size than those of staphylococci, but the zones were dim. all strains with the 209p indicator produced dim zones of the 2mm size. the larger inhibition zones (2-5mm) in comparison with staphylococci were observed in enterococci on the zal medium with the ao24/85 strain. the production of tested strains was balanced on vlg agar with respect to the use of both indicators.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro activity of cefpirome (hr 810) against enterococci and staphylococci.
AB  == the inhibitory activity of cefpirome (hr 810), a new cephalosporin derivative for parenteral use, was tested by agar dilution methods against enterococcus faecalis (100 strains), staphylococcus aureus (40 strains) and coagulase-negative staphylococcal species (60 strains) in comparison with other beta-lactam antibiotics. for e. faecalis, the cefpirome minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) range was 2-128 micrograms/ml, with an mic50 of 8 micrograms/ml, and an mic90 of 64 micrograms/ml. the optimal bactericidal activity against strains with mics of < or = 8 micrograms/ml occurred at 2-4 times the mic, and the reduction in the initial inoculum was 99.9-99.7% after 24 h incubation at these concentrations. mec gene-negative staphylococci (both s. aureus and coagulase-negative species) had cefpirome mics of 0.25-2 micrograms/ml (mic50 0.5 microgram/ml, mic90 1 microgram/ml). mec gene-positive strains had mics of 0.5-128 micrograms/ml (mic50 2 micrograms/ml, mic90 32 micrograms/ml). strains with borderline resistance to oxacillin which did not harbor the mec gene and which were susceptible to cefpirome maintained their susceptibility even when high-density inocula were used and after several passages in media containing the antibiotic. these studies present some potential advantages of cefpirome over other cephalosporins in the inhibitory activity against gram-positive cocci.

TI  == comparison of the autoscan-w/a and vitek automicrobic systems for identification  and susceptibility testing of bacteria.
AB  == the identification and susceptibility testing of bacteria by the autoscan-w/a rapid panels and vitek automicrobic systems were compared. a total of 291 clinical isolates, including 207 members of the enterobacteriaceae, 41 nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, 31 staphylococcus aureus strains and 12 enterococcus faecalis strains, were tested. autoscan-w/a and vitek correctly identified 93% and 94% respectively of the enterobacteriaceae, the identification in an additional 2% and 5% of strains respectively being reported as correct with a low probability. autoscan-w/a reported all identification results within 2 h after inoculation, whereas vitek reported the identification results for the majority of gram-negative bacilli between 4 h and 6 h after inoculation. autoscan-w/a and vitek reported 81% and 74% of mic results respectively after 3-6 h incubation. the rates of very major susceptibility errors were 0.4% and 0.4% for autoscan-w/a and vitek respectively, the rates of major errors 0.4% and 1% respectively, and the rates of minor errors 4% and 3% respectively. six of 30 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains failed to grow sufficiently for susceptibility testing in the autoscan-w/a system, and four xanthomonas maltophilia strains had  insufficient growth for susceptibility testing in both systems. the majority of results of susceptibility testing of nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli were reported more than 6 h after inoculation. both systems were reliable and easy to  operate, and gave accurate results for common clinical isolates.

TI  == optimal method for culturing vascular prosthetic grafts.
AB  == vascular prosthetic infection may be underrecognized when identified by standard  culture techniques. improved microbiologic methodology may enhance detection of bacteria in prosthetic graft specimens, and thus may alter clinical decisions. quantitative culture techniques were employed to compare three methods of enhancing bacterial recovery from dacron graft cylinders seeded with commonly encountered bacterial pathogens. methods included: (1) ultrasonic bath treatment, (2) direct ultrasonic disruption, and (3) agitation on a vortex mixer. ultrasonic bath treatment released bacteria with colony counts that were consistently greater by 1 log than direct ultrasonic disruption and vortex agitation. direct ultrasonic disruption at high energy levels selectively killed gram-negative bacteria by as much as a 4 log decrease in viable organisms. agitation (vortex mixing) of the specimen produced the lowest counts among the three methods tested. these data would indicate that a 5-min ultrasonic bath treatment was the  optimal method of preparation of vascular prostheses for bacterial culture.

TI  == [a comparative microbiological and pharmacokinetic activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin].
AB  == vancomycin and teicoplanin are two commercially available glycopeptide antibiotics. they have identical spectra of activity and similar mechanisms of action, and both are complex molecules. in vitro, vancomycin is more active against coagulase-negative staphylococci, while teicoplanin is more active against enterococci and pneumococci. the activity of the two antibiotics against  staphylococcus aureus is similar. the serum pharmacokinetics of vancomycin and teicoplanin are highly different, teicoplanin having a longer elimination half-life (40 hours versus 6-8 hours for vancomycin), but a higher degree of protein binding (90% versus 55%). we compared the two antibiotics on the basis of their inhibitory quotient kinetics, using the mic90 values for the above bacterial species as the microbiological parameters, and the total and free (non-protein bound) serum concentrations as the pharmacokinetic parameters. the inhibitory quotient kinetics of vancomycin were always more favorable in terms of the free concentrations, even against those bacteria for which the teicoplanin mic was lower.

TI  == [evaluation of in vitro antimicrobial activity of cefazolin alone and in combination with cefmetazole or flomoxef using agar dilution method and disk diffusion method].
AB  == antimicrobial activities of cefazolin (cez) against 251 strains of various clinical isolates obtained during 1989 and 1990 were determined using the mueller-hinton agar dilution method at an inoculum level 10(6) cfu/ml. the reliability of the disk susceptility test was also studied using mueller-hinton agar and various disks at inoculum levels of 10(3-4) cfu/cm2 in estimating approximate values of mics. in addition, antimicrobial activities of cez and cefmetazole (cmz) or flomoxef (fmox) in combination were investigated against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mssa and mrsa) using  the checkerboard agar dilution mic method and the disk diffusion test either with the disks contained cez, cmz, and fmox alone, or cez, and cmz or fmox in combination. in this study, the mics of cez against s. aureus were distributed with the 3 peak values at 0.39 microgram/ml, 3.13 micrograms/ml and > 100 micrograms/ml. mics against mssa were 0.39 microgram/ml to 0.78 microgram/ml, whereas those against mrsa were greater than 0.78 microgram/ml. mics against majority of strains of enterococcus faecalis were 25 micrograms/ml. over 90% of strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited at the level of 3.13 micrograms/ml. about 60% of isolates of indole negative proteus spp. were inhibited at the levels of less than 3.13 micrograms/ml and 100% at 6.25 micrograms/ml, but mics against indole positive proteus spp., serratia spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa were over 100 micrograms/ml. the antimicrobial activities  of cez against these clinical isolates were not significantly different compared  to those reported about 15-20 years ago, except for s. aureus. highly resistant strains of s. aureus to cez were more prevalent in this study. the inhibitory zones obtained with the disk test were compared with mics. the results of cez disk susceptibility test with 30 micrograms disk (showa) or 10 micrograms disk (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with mics (r = -0.837 and -0.814, respectively), showing the reliavility of the disk method in estimating approximate values of mics. in the 4 category classification system currently used in japan, break points in mic values proposed are () mic < or = 3 micrograms/ml, (++) > 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) > 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) > 60 micrograms/ml. the results obtained with 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 7.7% and false negative in 6.8% of the samples. the disk results with e. faecalis showed a higher ratio of false positive results.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == a descriptive analysis of urine cultures: pure versus mixed isolates.
AB  == out of 5,670 urine cultures performed in 1989, 1,448 positive cultures with unique results were analyzed. of these 1,448, 67% were pure cultures, and 50% had at least one isolate with a colony count greater than 100,000 colony forming units/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and diphtheroids were more likely (p < 0.01) to occur in mixed than pure culture, while escherichia coli was more likely to occur in pure than mixed culture. the most common organism combinations were diphtheroids-coagulase negative staphylococcus (30 cultures), e. faecalis-coagulase negative staphylococcus (28), e. faecalis-p. aeruginosa (13),  k. pneumoniae-p. aeruginosa (9), and e. coli-p. aeruginosa (9).

TI  == comparison of the gentamicin resistance transposon tn5281 with regions encoding gentamicin resistance in enterococcus faecalis isolates from diverse geographic locations.
AB  == the genetic determinant encoding gentamicin resistance (gmr) on the beta-lactamase encoding plasmid pbem10 of enterococcus faecalis hh22 is carried on a transposon, termed tn5281, that is highly related to the staphylococcal gmr  transposons tn4001 found in australian isolates of staphylococcus aureus and tn4031 found in united states isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis. we have now studied plasmid dna from gmr strains of e. faecalis isolated from diverse geographical locations (houston, pennsylvania, thailand, and chile) by using restriction endonuclease analysis and dna-dna hybridization to determine whether  other gmr e. faecalis carry tn5281 or a similar type of element. we also compared these enterococci to several united states isolates of staphylococcus aureus with nonmobile gmr determinants. three e. faecalis isolates (from houston and chile) carried tn5281-like elements, whereas two isolates (from houston and pennsylvania) had restriction endonuclease and dna-dna hybridization patterns more similar to those of the tn4001-is257 hybrid found in the nonmobile gmr determinants in united states isolates of s. aureus. a strain from thailand had a third pattern unrelated to either tn5281 or the nonmobile gmr determinants present in united states isolates of s. aureus. our results demonstrate that there is both similarity and diversity between the gmr determinant of strains of  e. faecalis isolated in diverse geographic locations.

AB  == am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains  tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.

TI  == macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from various bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability  to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. some of the highly purified ltas, in particular ltas from bacillus subtilis, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, and enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. as after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these ltas reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. other purified ltas, i.e., ltas from streptococcus sanguis, s. pneumoniae, and l. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native lta from s. aureus was inactive. there was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain  length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of ltas. deacylation of ltas resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated ltas did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of lta to the cell surface. the results demonstrate that some lta species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.

AB  == an electrical device designed to prevent microbial attachment to plastic intravascular cannulae is described. the device produced an electrical current (10 microa) in both carbon-impregnated and 'hydrocath' cannulae. in-vitro models  were utilized to demonstrate that the current can block several mechanisms by which microorganisms gain initial access to intravascular devices, including extra- and intra-luminal routes. the electrical system prevented organisms from traversing along both the external and internal surfaces of the cannulae. effective prevention of cannula colonization was demonstrated subsequent to challenge with staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. the findings suggest that the electrical device may offer in-vivo cannula protection  from microbial attachment and colonization, thereby reducing the potential for infection.

AB  == sce-2787, a new cephalosporin having a condensed azolium moiety in the 3 position and an aminothiadiazolyl group in the 7 beta side chain, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo activities in comparison with those of ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefpirome, and e1040. against methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, sce-2787 was more active than ceftazidime  and e1040 and was as active as flomoxef and cefpirome, with mics for 90% of strains tested (mic90s) being 1.56 micrograms/ml or less. sce-2787 was also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which the mic90 was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was lower than that of cefpirome and comparable to that of ceftazidime. sce-2787 was marginally active against methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci and enterococcus faecalis, although its mic90s were the lowest among those of the antibiotics tested. the activities of sce-2787 against streptococcus species, most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, and haemophilus influenzae exceeded those of ceftazidime and flomoxef and were comparable to those of cefpirome. furthermore, mic90s of sce-2787 were significantly lower than those of ceftazidime for ceftazidime-resistant isolates  of citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae. sce-2787 was resistant to hydrolysis by various types of beta-lactamases, including the bush group 1 beta-lactamases, and had low affinities for these enzymes, with km or ki values of greater than 100 microm. the in vitro activity of sce-2787 was reflected in its efficacy in mouse protection tests. thus, sce-2787 appears to be a promising  cephalosporin that should be further evaluated in clinical trials.

TI  == in-vitro activity of rp 59500, a semisynthetic streptogramin, against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of rp 59500, an injectable streptogramin derived from pristinamycin, was determined by agar dilution and compared with that of pristinamycin. two hundred and sixty-one recent clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci were tested against both antibiotics. the two compounds displayed similar activities. the mic90s of rp 59500 ranged from 0.5 to 2 mg/l in 114 strains of staphylococcus aureus showing various phenotypes of antibiotic resistance (penicillin-susceptible; penicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible; methicillin-resistant; erythromycin-resistant, either inducible or constitutive; quinolone-resistant). similar results were obtained with coagulase-negative staphylococci. rp 59500 was consistently active against streptococci, with mic90s of 0.25, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes  (n = 20), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 20) and streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 20), respectively. enterococcus faecalis (n = 20) appeared to be notably less susceptible (mic90, 8 mg/l). in view of this consistent activity against all staphylococci and streptococci tested, including multiply resistant isolates, rp  59500 merits further investigation.

TI  == influence of transient salivary flora on assessment of mutans streptococci level  by the "strip mutans" method.
AB  == the dentocult sm ("strip mutans") method occasionally shows decoloration of broth and of colonies of mutans streptococci on the plastic strip, thereby making interpretation difficult. in an attempt to explain the phenomenon and to investigate the influence of the salivary flora on the "strip mutans" method, a total of 46 subjects were sampled. saliva was analyzed using the "strip mutans" method and conventional plating techniques to identify mutans streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, enteric bacteria, and yeasts. approximately 85% of the "strip mutans" scores coincided with the conventional msb-plating method. two samples showed decolored mutans streptococci colonies on the "strip mutans" strip. enterococcus spp. were present in the saliva of these test subjects and could grow in the "strip mutans" broth. enterococcus faecalis was able to induce  the same type of decoloration under experimental pure culture conditions. three "strip mutans" samples showed small colonies of mutans streptococci, visible only under magnification (x 10-20). staphylococcus epidermidis was present in these saliva samples and showed heavy growth in the broth. under experimental pure culture conditions s. epidermidis also inhibited the growth of mutans streptococci to some extent.

TI  == handwashing and disinfection of heavily contaminated hands--effective or ineffective?
AB  == hands are among the principal vehicles for transfer of nosocomial pathogens in hospitals. often, outbreaks of infection are thought to be caused by a lack of compliance with handwashing guidelines, rather than due to the inadequacy of the  handwashing agents used. in this study the effectiveness of proper handwashing and the use of three different hand disinfectants: ethanol 70% (e), isopropanol 40% (i) and alcoholic chlorhexidine (70%) (ac) was compared using three volunteers whose fingertips were heavily contaminated with a succession of bacteria including: enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae. after each contamination, thorough handwashing and application of one disinfectant on the hands were performed three times. fingerprint-samples were taken before and 1 min after application of the disinfectants. thorough handwashing with an ordinary liquid soap ('sterisol') did not reduce the confluent growth of bacteria on fingertips for any of the species  used (197 examinations). only ac had a significant effect on fingers heavily contaminated with s. aureus (126 examinations; ac compared with e and i; p less than 0.0002 and p less than 0.0002 respectively), but did not completely eradicate the bacteria. after contamination with ent. cloacae (118 examinations), none of the three agents were particularly effective, but e and ac seemed to be somewhat more effective than i (p less than 0.0002 and p less than 0.01 respectively). when successive contamination was performed using all bacterial species, ac was the most effective decontaminant. however, ent. cloacae was still present on the fingertips after 15 repeated courses of handwashing and applications of disinfectants. bathing of hands in ac for 20s completely eradicated all bacteria from the hands. the study demonstrates that, when heavily contaminated, an ordinary handwashing followed by disinfectants is not enough to  eradicate potentially pathogenic bacteria from the hands.

TI  == the housefly (musca domestica) as a carrier of pathogenic microorganisms in a hospital environment.
AB  == houseflies have long been regarded as potential carriers of microorganisms. since pathogenic microorganisms are widespread in the hospital environment, there is abundant opportunity for flies to become contaminated and, in turn, to contaminate the patient environment. in the present study, an attempt was made to isolate and identify pathogenic bacteria, fungi and parasites from the housefly musca domestica collected in the surgical ward of the all india institute of medical sciences hospital and also in a remote residential area located 5 km from the hospital. a total of 113 flies were collected: 65 from a surgical ward (test) and 48 from a residential area for comparison. ten genera of bacteria were isolated from the test group of flies compared with nine from the control group.  in primary isolations, it was observed that the load of bacteria carried by the test group of flies was significantly more (p less than 0.001) than for the control flies. pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and viridans streptococci were isolated only from the test flies. the isolation rate of staphylococcus aureus was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in test houseflies than in the control houseflies. there was no significant difference in isolation of parasitic ova and cysts from test and control houseflies. candida spp. were isolated in almost equal numbers from both groups of houseflies, yet none of these was candida albicans. houseflies therefore may act as vectors of potentially pathogenic bacteria in a hospital environment.

AB  == to better define the pharmacokinetics and serum bactericidal activity (sba) of ciprofloxacin and other antimicrobial agents in the elderly, six healthy (greater than 65 years) volunteers with normal renal function were given ciprofloxacin alone orally, ciprofloxacin plus rifampin orally, ciprofloxacin plus clindamycin  orally, rifampin alone orally (three volunteers), and, for comparison of sba against gram-positive cocci, vancomycin intravenously. mean peak ciprofloxacin concentrations and other pharmacokinetic parameters were not altered significantly by coadministration of either rifampin or clindamycin. ciprofloxacin had somewhat greater sba against the oxacillin-susceptible and oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains tested than did vancomycin, but rifampin was by far the most active single agent tested. the sba of rifampin against s. aureus was modestly antagonized during combination therapy with ciprofloxacin, but substantial sba still was present. the ciprofloxacin sba against s. aureus was completely antagonized by clindamycin if the strains were susceptible to the latter agent. ciprofloxacin had modest sba against group a streptococci and no sba against the three pneumococcal strains tested. all of the regimens had poor to absent sba against enterococcus faecalis. by contrast, ciprofloxacin had excellent sba against escherchia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae and moderate sba against pseudomonas aeruginosa. combination therapy with rifampin or clindamycin in general enhanced the sba against the nonenterococcal streptococci and had no effect on the sba against the gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == bacterial growth on suction drain tips. prospective study of 489 clean orthopedic operations.
AB  == the study included 489 clean orthopedic operations with implantation of major foreign materials (joint replacements and internal fixations of fractures). specimens for culture were taken from the suction drainage system, either from the drain fluid or from the drain-tube tip or from both. six superficial and five deep infections were seen following the operations. only two cultures of drain fluid were positive, and neither of these became infected. positive drain-tip cultures were seen after 56 operations, and of these, five were followed by infection. the risk of infection was increased if staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, or streptococcus faecalis was cultured from drain tips. drain-tip cultures growing only coagulase-negative staphylococci, nonhemolytic streptococci, and corynebacteria were not correlated with increased risk of infection. there was a not significant tendency towards fewer infections if positive drain-tip cultures with virulent bacteria were treated with specific antibiotics.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

AB  == we examined mics of 6 oral new quinolones and 4 oral cephems against bacteria isolated from patients at 6 hospitals in osaka during the period from january to  june in 1990, and the following results were obtained. 1. all species excluding streptococcus pyogenes were more sensitive with less frequencies of resistance to new quinolones than to cephems. in new quinolones, tosufloxacin (tflx) was the most active against gram-positive cocci and ciprofloxacin (cpfx) and tflx had the highest activities against gram-negative rods. 2. resistant (mic of cpfx greater  than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml) strains to new quinolones were observed at higher frequencies than 10% among staphylococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, serratia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia and xanthomonas maltophilia. 3. the frequency of staphylococcus aureus resistant to new quinolones isolated from in-patients or urine was significantly higher than that from out-patients or other sources. on the other hand, there was no significant difference in resistance frequencies of p. aeruginosa due to types of patients or sources. but, there were significant differences in frequencies of resistant organisms of either species to new quinolones among hospitals. 4. twenty-seven strains (19.7%) of 137 s. aureus strains examined were methicillin-resistant, and they were similarly resistant to new quinolones also. methicillin susceptible s. aureus were also similarly sensitive to new quinolones.

TI  == lack of homology of enterococci which have high-level resistance to trimethoprim  with the dfra gene of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == multiresistant enterococci were tested for susceptibility to trimethoprim (tmp).  although most enterococci are inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, the mics for 7 of 29 selected multiresistant isolates were greater  than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, including for two beta-lactamase positive (bla+) strains, for which the mics of tmp were greater than 1,000 micrograms/ml,  and for another bla+ strain, for which the mic was 128 micrograms/ml. none of five isolates tested transferred tmp resistance and none of the resistant isolates hybridized to the dfra gene of staphylococcus aureus. whether tmp resistance in enterococci is due to a mutation(s) or to acquisition of a new gene is not known. acquisition of resistance to tmp is another example of the multiple antimicrobial resistance typically displayed by enterococci.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the beta-lactamase gene from enterococcus faecalis hh22 and its similarity to staphylococcal beta-lactamase genes.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the constitutively produced beta-lactamase (bla) gene  from enterococcus faecalis hh22 was shown to be identical to the published sequences of three of four staphylococcal type a beta-lactamase genes; more differences were seen with the genes for staphylococcal type c and d enzymes. one hundred forty nucleotides upstream of the beta-lactamase start codon were determined for an inducible staphylococcal beta-lactamase and were identical to those of the constitutively expressed enterococcal gene, indicating that the changes resulting in constitutive expression are not due to changes in the promoter or operator region. moreover, complementation studies indicated that production of the enterococcal enzyme could be repressed. the genes for the enterococcal bla and an inducible staphylococcal bla were each cloned into a shuttle vector and transformed into enterococcal and staphylococcal recipients. the major difference between the backgrounds of the two hosts was that more enzyme was produced by the staphylococcal host, regardless of the source of the gene. the location of the enzyme was found to be host dependent, since each cloned gene generated extracellular (free) enzyme in the staphylococcus and cell-bound enzyme in the enterococcus. on the basis of the identities of the enterococcal bla and several staphylococcal bla sequences, these data suggest the recent spread of beta-lactamase to enterococci and also suggest the loss of a functional repressor.

TI  == effect of nacl-induced osmotic stress on intracellular concentrations of glycine  betaine and potassium in escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococci.
AB  == staphylococci are more salt tolerant than are enterococci or escherichia coli. they have a more rigid cell wall and higher internal turgor pressure. the mechanisms of nacl-induced osmotic tolerance among these bacteria were examined by determining the generation of osmoprotective activity of cellular extracts and intracellular concentrations of glycine betaine and potassium (k+) in response to graded amounts of nacl. staphylococci as well as e. coli were shown to require choline or glycine betaine to achieve maximal salt tolerance. in response to 0.9  mol/l nacl, e. coli exhibited a marked increase in osmoprotective activity, a 168-fold rise in glycine betaine, and a 2.3-fold rise in k+. enterococcus faealis exhibited a small increase in osmoprotective activity, a 9.3-fold increase in glycine betaine, and a twofold increase in k+. in contrast, strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. saprophyticus were found to have considerably greater osmoprotective activity, glycine betaine, and k+ than other  organisms, even in the absence of external osmotic stress. glycine betaine rose in some strains, but k+ remained virtually unchanged as the concentration of nacl was increased. the high concentrations of glycine betaine and k+ in staphylococci, even in the absence of osmotic stress, may explain in part their remarkable salt tolerance and high turgor pressure.

TI  == cloning and nucleotide base sequence analysis of a spectinomycin adenyltransferase aad(9) determinant from enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis ldr55, a human clinical isolate, is resistant to tetracycline (tcr), erythromycin (emr), and high levels (greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) of spectinomycin (spr) but not streptomycin. filter matings between strain ldr55 and e. faecalis og1-rf produced transconjugants with the following resistance phenotypes: tcr emr spr, tcr emr, tcr spr, and tcr only but  never emr or spr only. the genetic determinant encoding resistance to spectinomycin was cloned in streptococcus sanguis challis from pdl55, a 26-kb plasmid harbored by a tcr spr transconjugant. subcloning experiments yielded a 1.1-kb clai-ndei fragment that encoded very high-level spr in s. sanguis (10 mg/ml) and escherichia coli (50 mg/ml). cell extracts of cultures obtained from spr strains expressed adenylating activity for spectinomycin but not for streptomycin, indicating that spr was due to an aad(9) activity. the nucleotide base sequence of the 1.1-kb clai-ndei fragment contained a single 750-base open reading frame. the protein predicted from the open reading frame consisted of 250 amino acids and had a calculated size of approximately 28,000 daltons, similar to the size estimated from maxicell analysis (29,000 daltons). the deduced amino acid sequence of the streptococcal aad(9) was compared with that of the aad(9) encoded by staphylococcal transposon tn554. the two proteins shared approximately 39% amino acid identity, which was expanded to 53% when conservative amino acid changes were included. when the streptococcal protein was compared with an aad(3")(9) protein of e. coli, the degrees of identity were 27 and 47%, on the basis of actual amino acids and conservative replacements, respectively. the cloning and nucleotide base sequence analyses of the spectinomycin aad(9) determinant from e. faecalis that results in high-level spr when transferred to s. sanguis or e. coli are presented.

AB  == in enterococcus faecalis, the genetic determinant encoding gentamicin resistance  (gmr) on the conjugative plasmid pbem10 previously has been shown to be on a mobile element. in the current study, this element, termed tn5281, was shown to relocate in the absence of homologous recombination in e. faecalis uv202. on the  basis of restriction endonuclease analysis and dna-dna hybridization studies, tn5281 was shown to be similar, if not identical, to the gmr transposons tn4001 found in australian isolates of staphylococcus aureus and tn4031 found in u.s. isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, since all three of these transposons have symmetrically located hindiii (2.5 kb apart), clai (slightly more than 2.5 kb apart), and haeiii (3.9 kb apart) sites. restriction endonuclease digestion patterns of tn5281 generated with hincii, scai, and alui were also consistent with tn4001 and tn4031. by using a probe specific for the external portion of the terminal inverted repeat of tn4031, it was determined that each terminus of tn5281 contained a 0.35-kb haeiii fragment and a 0.7-kb hindiii-haeiii fragment.  the sizes of these fragments are identical to those found in the staphylococcal transposons, which is a further indication that inverted repeats like is256 are present in tn5281. a 1-kb haeiii fragment in pbem10 also hybridized with this probe, which indicates that tn5281 in pbem10 contains a double copy of the inverted repeat at one end.

AB  == the in vitro activity of sparfloxacin was compared with those of tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and fleroxacin against 730 bacterial isolates representing 49 different species. sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin had similar spectra of activity, but sparfloxacin was less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and more active against many gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria. tosufloxacin mics were generally 8- to 16-fold lower than those for sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. all four fluoroquinolones were active against nalidixic acid-susceptible strains of the family enterobacteriaceae (mic for 90% of the isolates [mic90], less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml) but nalidixic acid-resistant strains were less susceptible (mic90, greater than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml). against pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, mic90s were 1.0 micrograms/ml for tosufloxacin, 2.0 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin, and 4.0 micrograms/ml for sparfloxacin. against enterococcus faecalis, sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin mic90s were 1.0 and 2.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. mic90s for ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus were 0.016 micrograms/ml for tosufloxacin, 0.06 micrograms/ml for sparfloxacin, and 0.5 micrograms/ml for both ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin. with four species of gram-negative bacilli, mutants resistant to two to four times the sparfloxacin mic occurred spontaneously at frequencies of 10(-7) to 10(-9): single-step high-level resistance was not observed. in vitro-selected sparfloxacin-resistant mutants displayed cross-resistance to other quinolones, as did clinical isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus. tosufloxacin mics with broth microdilution methods were four- to eightfold greater than those obtained with agar dilution methods. the two procedures gave comparable results when sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin was being tested.

TI  == penetration into tissues of various drugs active against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == gram-positive bacteria are the most important pathogens causing hospital- and community-acquired infections. we therefore reviewed the penetration of various antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus into tissues, where staphylococcal infections are common. rifampicin reaches heart valve concentrations of 65% of the simultaneous serum levels. at 8 h after administration blood and tissues concentrations of rifampicin exceeded the mic90 values for s. aureus as well as for s. epidermidis. after a 2-g intravenous bolus injection of flucloxacillin heart valve concentrations exceeded mic values for staphylococci for more than 8 h whereas subcutaneous and muscle concentrations declined within the same time to undetectable levels. the mic90 values of vancomycin for s. epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis are 2.0 and 4.0 mg/l respectively and for s. aureus 1.0 mg/l. this concentration is reached in subcutaneous tissue, heart valves and muscle for at least 4-6 h after administration of 15 mg/kg, however the corresponding value for enterococcus faecalis in heart valve is maintained only for 3-4 h. after two and three dose regimens of teicoplanin serum and bone levels were significantly higher than fat levels, exceeding the mic90 values for s. aureus, s. epidermidis and e. faecalis. the ratio of tissue concentration of teicoplanin to serum concentrations was 11% for fat and 65% for bone.

TI  == teicoplanin monotherapy of serious infections caused by gram-positive bacteria: a re-evaluation of patients with endocarditis or staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia  from a european open trial.
AB  == we have examined case records for patients who received teicoplanin alone for endocarditis or staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. all patients with streptococcal endocarditis were cured (viridans group 14/14; group d 4/4). cure rates for other organisms were: enterococcus faecalis 3/5; s. aureus 5/10 and coagulase negative staphylococci 2/3. doses for six patients who failed because of poor response were 3.3-4.2 mg/kg. teicoplanin treatment cured 41/48 patients with s. aureus bacteraemia; treatment failed in two patients because of adverse events. doses in the remaining treatment failures were 2.1-5.0 mg/kg. in comparison, 48 patients in dundee hospitals received ten different drugs in 20 combinations for s. aureus bacteraemia; 29 patients received cloxacillin or flucloxacillin but initial doses varied from 0.25-2.0 g. we conclude that the european database does provide evidence that teicoplanin monotherapy is effective for serious infection with gram-positive bacteria. doses for staphylococcal infection should probably be at least 6 mg/kg. the upper limit of the teicoplanin dosage range remains to be determined but there is evidently considerable confusion about appropriate regimens for 'standard' therapy.

TI  == in vitro activity of rp 59500, a semisynthetic injectable pristinamycin, against  staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci.
AB  == the in vitro activity of rp 59500, a semisynthetic pristinamycin, was compared with the activities of vancomycin, oxacillin, ampicillin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and rifampin against five staphylococcus species, five streptococcus species, and four enterococcus species. for staphylococci, mics were 0.13 to 1 microgram/ml and the mics for 90% of the strains tested (mic90s) were 0.13 to 0.5 microgram/ml; there were no differences between oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant strains. for streptococci, mics were 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml and mic90s were 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml; viridans group streptococci were the least susceptible streptococci. for enterococci, mics were  0.25 to 32 micrograms/ml and mic90s were 2 to 4 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecalis was the least susceptible. vancomycin was the only comparative drug with consistent activity against all species of gram-positive cocci. with rp 59500, raising the inoculum 100-fold, lowering the ph of cation-adjusted mueller-hinton  broth to 5.5, or omitting cation supplementation had little effect on mics, but 50% serum increased mics 2 to 4 dilution steps. the differences between mbcs and  mics were greater for staphylococci and enterococci than for streptococci. time-kill studies with 24 strains indicated that rp 59500 concentrations 2-, 4-,  and 16-fold greater than the mics usually killed bacteria of each species at similar rates; reductions in cfu per milliliter were less than those observed with oxacillin or vancomycin against staphylococci and less than those observed with ampicillin against enterococci. rp 59500 antagonized the bactericidal activities of oxacillin and gentamicin against staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and that of ampicillin against e. faecalis atcc 29212. against the latter, combination with gentamicin was indifferent. rp 59500 has a broad spectrum of in  vitro activity against gram-positive cocci; combining it with other drugs is not  advantageous.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp.  against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.

TI  == effect of hydrogen peroxide on growth of candida, cryptococcus, and other yeasts  in simulated blood culture bottles.
AB  == the addition of hydrogen peroxide to blood contained in liquid culture medium increased the dissolved-o2 partial pressure in direct proportion to the volume injected. the effect of hydrogen peroxide on the growth of subcultured clinical isolates of candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans, torulopsis glabrata, and other yeasts and on the growth of blood culture isolates of representative pathogenic bacteria was compared with its effect on their growth in vented and unvented stationary bottles. c. albicans and c. neoformans grew significantly better in bottles to which hydrogen peroxide had been added than in vented or unvented bottles. the advantage of hydrogen peroxide over venting was most marked with several slowly growing strains. similar results were obtained in shaker cultures with strains of c. albicans which were inoculated directly from positive blood cultures. the effect of hydrogen peroxide tended to diminish during serial  passage. t. glabrata grew less well when hydrogen peroxide was added, perhaps because of the absence of oxidase. the growth of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococcus faecalis was not significantly inhibited or augmented by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. the growth of escherichia coli was inhibited slightly. the value of the addition of hydrogen peroxide to blood cultures to improve the isolation of yeasts needs to be established by a clinical trial which would compare this method with established methods.

AB  == the in-vitro inactivation of metronidazole by different clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis was investigated by means of association experiments in which ent. faecalis strains and bacteroides fragilis group strains were cultured  in the same liquid medium. all of the tested ent. faecalis strains (20 isolates)  were able to protect the b. fragilis group strains against the killing effect of  metronidazole at a concentration four or eight times higher than the normal mic.  different strains of streptococcus (14), staphylococcus aureus (10), staph, epidermidis (10) and escherichia coli (8) failed to exhibit the same effect. when ent. faecalis strains were cultured anaerobically for 24 h in the presence of 4 mg metronidazole/l, either alone or together with different b. fragilis group strains, no metronidazole could be detected subsequently in the culture supernatants by hplc. concomitantly an increase of four or five logs in the viable counts of the co-cultured bacteroides strains was observed compared with bacteroides strains cultured alone. sonicated cell extracts of ent. faecalis cultured either aerobically or anaerobically were found to inactivate metronidazole to the same extent, whereas the culture supernatants had no such effect.

TI  == intravenous ofloxacin in severe infections.
AB  == the efficacy and tolerance of intravenous ofloxacin was studied in 70 patients suffering from soft tissue infections (n = 33), intra-abdominal abscesses (n = 14), septicaemia (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 9) and brucellosis (n = 2). the average daily dose was 6 mg/kg divided into two doses. pathogens treated included enterobacter cloacae (n = 14), escherichia coli (n = 12), staphylococcus aureus (n = 13), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 11), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10), enterococcus faecalis (n = 8) and streptococcus spp. (n = 5). most patients had several underlying diseases. most of the patients had received other antibiotic therapy without success. clinically, 41% were considered cured, 19% improved and  30% failed to respond. bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 52.5% and  persisted in 22.5%. adverse reactions included an anaphylactoid reaction, abnormal liver function (n = 13) and insomnia (n = 2). this study suggests that higher doses of ofloxacin may be needed in deep seated infections.

TI  == effect of pefloxacin on microorganism: host cell interaction.
AB  == recent evidence indicates that certain antibiotics affect bacterial adherence and phagocyte-micro-organism interactions. these interactions are important in the early stages of bacterial pathogenesis, that is, attachment to mucosal surfaces and invasion. among the antibiotics of interest in this field are the fluoroquinolones. sub-mics of pefloxacin can alter the ability of gram-positive cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli) to adhere to different eukaryotic cells (uroepithelial and buccal cells) and to fibrin-platelet matrices. the mechanism by which pefloxacin  reduces adhesion is not completely understood. however in the case of esch. coli, the inhibition of haemagglutination and adherence corresponds to: (1) a decrease  in production of fimbriae; (2) changes in the composition of outer membrane proteins; and (3) an effect on partition coefficient (carried out with the peg/dextran system) which can be attributed to changes in electric and/or hydrophobic properties of the esch. coli surface. the first step of phagocytosis  is represented by adherence of opsonized bacteria to the membrane receptors of phagocytes. consequently, the action of pefloxacin on phagocytosis is also of importance. pretreatment of bacteria (staph. aureus, ent. faecalis, esch. coli and legionella pneumophila) with 1/4 the mic of pefloxacin leads to an increase in uptake of the different strains by phagocytes (polymorphonuclear leucocytes and macrophages). exposure of the phagocytes to 10 mg/l of pefloxacin enhances phagocytosis of strains that have not been pretreated. finally, entry of antibiotics into phagocytic cells is a prerequisite for activity against intracellular organisms. the concentration of pefloxacin by polymorphs and macrophages is high (intracellular concentration/extracellular concentration = 5-10). such findings correlate well with the intracellular activity of pefloxacin, demonstrated with guinea pig macrophages and different bacteria (staph. aureus, l. pneumophila).

AB  == radiolabeled penicillin g is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (pbp) assays. the disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin g are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. we  investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin v as an alternative reagent. radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin v with [125i]na, using a modification of the chloramine-t method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. we demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3h]penicillin g and locally synthesized [125i]penicillin v (ipv) in their recognition of bacterial pbps. profiles of pbps in membranes from bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, providencia rettgeri, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, and enterococcus faecium labeled with ipv or [3h]penicillin g were virtually identical. use of ipv as the imaging  agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the pbps of e. coli yielded results similar to those  obtained in experiments with [3h]penicillin g. dried electrophoretic gels from typical pbp experiments, using ipv at 37.3 ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed  x-ray film in 8 to 24 h. the stability of ipv on storage at 4 degrees c was inversely proportional to specific activity. at 37.3 ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, ipv retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees c.  ipv represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid pbp assays.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin-metronidazole combinations against mixed bacterial cultures: reduced activity of metronidazole against bacteroides species in the presence of enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin-metronidazole combinations against mixed cultures of gram-positive facultative cocci and strains of the bacteroides fragilis group was investigated. metronidazole did not influence the high activity of daptomycin against strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis in the absence or presence of the co-cultured bacteroides strains. in contrast, the enterococcus faecalis isolates  protected the co-cultured bacteroides strains against the killing effect of metronidazole, even at a concentration four- or eightfold the mic of metronidazole. killing curve experiments confirmed this protective effect of different isolates of enterococcus faecalis.

AB  == the in vitro activity of pd127,391, a new 4-quinolone, was compared to that of ciprofloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates from patients with cancer. pd127,391 was found to have a broad antimicrobial spectrum with excellent activity against gram-positive isolates (including multidrug-resistant organism such as corynebacterium jeikeium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp.). it was also extremely active against gram-negative bacilli including pseudomonas aeruginosa. against organisms such as achromobacter xylosoxidans, acinetobacter spp. and xanthomonas maltophilia, which are frequently resistant to a variety of antimicrobial agents, pd127,391 exhibited good activity, inhibiting  all such isolates at a concentration of 0.5 micrograms/ml. overall, pd127,391 was far more potent than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive isolates and slightly more active against gram-negative isolates. no bacterium that we examined needed  more than 2 micrograms/ml of pd127,391 for inhibition.

AB  == cefpirome (hr 810) is a new cephalosporin with a 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine group in the 3-position side chain. it was compared with other cephem antibiotics in protective and therapeutic effects on various experimental infections, systemic and local, in mice and rats. hr 810 had more potent protective effect than ceftazidime (caz), cefoperazone (cpz), and cefotaxime (ctx) on systemic infections induced by escherichia coli ec-31, staphylococcus aureus smith, and serratia marcescens sm-6 in mice. against systemic infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa hr 810 was as effective as caz. mice with leukopenia induced by cyclophosphamide were systemically infected with methicillin-resistant s. aureus  (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa), enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and enterococcus faecalis. hr 810 was superior to cefuzonam (czon) and cefmetazole against mrsa and mssa and was much more active than any other antibiotics tested against e. cloacae and a. calcoaceticus. in the activity against e. faecalis, hr 810 was inferior to ampicillin but superior to czon. in mice with pyelonephritis caused by e. coli ec-7, the rank order of activities was hr 810 greater than caz greater than ctx greater than cpz. hr 810  was more effective than latamoxef, caz, ctx, and cpz in improving lung infections induced by streptococcus pneumoniae hl 438 and klebsiella pneumoniae kp-51 in mice. hr 810 was superior to ctx and cpz and comparable to cefazolin in therapeutic effects on intrauterine infections with e. coli ec-89 and s. aureus smith in rats.

TI  == comparison of enterococcal and staphylococcal beta-lactamase plasmids.
AB  == in staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactamase (bla) is typically associated with transducible plasmids that also encode metal resistance or with the more recently described conjugative, gentamicin resistance plasmids. the beta-lactamase gene of enterococcus faecalis, which has been shown to be highly homologous to bla from the s. aureus plasmid p1258, is also encoded on conjugative, gentamicin resistance plasmids. to determine if the enterococcal bla-encoding plasmids are similar to those from staphylococci, bla-encoding plasmids from both species were compared by restriction endonuclease digestion followed by hybridization to bla and gentamicin resistance gene probes and to one of the enterococcal bla-encoding plasmids. although similarities were noted in the restriction endonuclease digestion patterns among the transducible staphylococcal plasmids (pi524, pi258,  and pii147) and among the conjugative gmr staphylococcal plasmids, neither of these restriction patterns was similar to those of the enterococcal plasmids. although the enterococcal plasmids showed extensive similarities by hybridization, the staphylococcal plasmids showed little or no similarity to the  enterococcal plasmids except for bla and the gentamicin resistance genes. whether enterococci acquired a different type of bla-encoding plasmid or whether bla was  acquired by transposition or by homologous recombination into enterococcal plasmids is unknown.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of econazole and miconazole sulfosalicylate.
AB  == the in vitro activities of new sulfosalicylic salts of econazole (e.ssa) and miconazole (m.ssa) have been investigated in comparison with the respective nitrate (nit) salts and sulfosalicylic acid (ssa) alone. the results reveal good  antimicrobial activity of m.ssa and e.ssa against different strains of candida, dermatophytes, moulds, gram-positive bacteria and trichomonas vaginalis. the mic  values demonstrate that m.ssa is more active than m.nit on candida and t. vaginalis. e.ssa was also more active than e.nit on t.vaginalis. both ssa and sodium sulfosalicylate (nassa) were practically without activity by themselves. finally, the ph variations did not significantly modify the activity of the ssa salts, suggesting that their greater activity could be due to better lipophilic activity of these compounds with respect to the nitrate salts.

AB  == the sensitivity of staph. aureus, staph. warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, strep.  pneumoneae and strep. faecalis to eleven 4-quinolone antibacterials was compared  by determining their minimum inhibitory concentrations on nutrient agar. in all cases where the minimum inhibitory concentration was less than 10 micrograms/ml then the frequency at which 4-quinolone-resistant mutants arose was estimated using each drug at 5, 10 and 20 times its minimum inhibitory concentration. it was found with all five bacterial species tested that ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were the most potent antibacterial and that no mutants could be detected in 10(12) bacteria for either drug with staph. warneri, strep. pneumoneae and strep. faecalis. on the other hand, mutants of pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to both  5 and 10 times (but not 20 times) the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were detected at similar frequencies in the 10(12) bacteria tested. with staph. aureus, mutants resisting 5 times (but not 10 or 20  times) the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were  detected in the 10(12) bacteria tested at similar frequencies. however, all mutants resistant to ciprofloxacin retained the ability to produce coagulase while the majority of ofloxacin-resistant mutants had lost their ability to produce coagulase. hence clear evidence for pathogenicity loss was observed with  ofloxacin but not with ciprofloxacin.

TI  == new screening test to determine the acceptability of 0.45-micron membrane filters for analysis of water.
AB  == during routine membrane filter (mf) quality control testing, irregularities such  as partial or complete inhibition of microbial growth at grid lines, abnormal spreading of colonies, growth in or along the grid lines, nonwetting areas, poor  colony sheen and metallic sheen on the mf surface with mendo agar, brittleness, decreased recovery, and severe wrinkling were observed with several lots of filters. to study these effects and to develop a more sensitive screening test for mf quality, we compared five different mfs with various types and degrees of  defects by using five stock coliform cultures and five different media. results showed that the enterobacter aerogenes-tryptic soy agar test system detected more mf defects than any other combination did and was superior to the escherichia coli-mfc agar american society for testing and materials method for grid line inhibition. filtered natural samples grown on the same media showed the same effects as were observed with the pure cultures. poor colony sheen and sheen on the mf surface were best detected with enterobacter aerogenes on mendo agar. the  use of tryptic soy agar and mendo agar with this organism permitted the maximum detection of mf irregularities. of the 142 mf lots tested by this method, 30% were acceptable, 10% were marginally acceptable, and 61% were unacceptable. this  method provides a valuable screening test for determining the acceptability of 0.45-microm-pore-size mfs used for coliform and heterotroph analysis and may also be useful in conjunction with other methods.

TI  == intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  == seventy-one adult patients with 72 infections were treated, by random selection,  with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin or intravenously administered ceftazidime. twenty-seven additional patients with 29 infections who were not appropriate for  random assignment were treated in an open study with intravenously administered ciprofloxacin only; the latter infections were generally more serious or were caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms. the most common doses were ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously and 500 mg orally every 12 hours and ceftazidime, 1 to 2 g intravenously every eight to 12 hours. forty-seven ciprofloxacin-treated infections and 31 ceftazidime-treated infections were evaluable for determination of efficacy. infections included lower respiratory tract (21 infections), urinary (37 infections), skin/soft tissue (14 infections), bacteremia/endocarditis (four infections), colitis (one infection), and mastoiditis (one infection). median minimal inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were, respectively: for enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis, no more than 0.06 and no more than 0.25 micrograms/ml; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml; for enterococcus faecalis, 1 and more than 32 micrograms/ml; and for staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 and 8 micrograms/ml. ciprofloxacin, 200 mg intravenously, yielded mean serum concentrations 0.5 and eight hours post-intravenous infusion of 2.3 and 0.7 micrograms/ml, respectively. satisfactory clinical responses were achieved in 17 (81 percent) of 21 patients with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, 22 (71 percent) of 31 patients with ceftazidime, and 20 (77 percent) of 26 patients with intravenous ciprofloxacin. the most common treatment failures occurred in complicated skin/soft-tissue infections treated with intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin, complicated urinary tract infections treated with ceftazidime, and necrotizing p. aeruginosa pneumonia treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin; the pneumonia patients all had respiratory failure and had been previously unresponsive to treatment with other  appropriate drugs. serious adverse reactions were observed in three patients, seizures with intravenous ciprofloxacin in two patients, and clostridium difficile diarrhea with ceftazidime in one patient. we conclude that sequential intravenous/oral ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were comparable in efficacy and safety; the ability to change from intravenous to oral therapy is a major convenience. intravenous ciprofloxacin was useful for more serious infections, often caused by ceftazidime-resistant organisms.

AB  == in vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (ipm/cs) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of mics and the results of disk susceptibility tests. the mics were determined using the agar dilution method at  an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the mic80s of imipenem (ipm) against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal mic distribution. however, the distribution of mics against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. group a streptococcus, enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by ipm at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. ipm inhibited escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a mic of 25 micrograms/ml, serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with mic greater than 100 micrograms/ml, citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. indole (-) proteus and indole (+) proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. the reliability of the ipm disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and  also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. for the interpretation of the showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. in the 4 category system for showa ipm disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. the results of the test using showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). with showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with mic less than 3 micrograms/ml  cannot be achieved. in this study, however, the differentiation of strains with mics less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set mic break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. according to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1986). ii. background of patients].
AB  == from july to october in 1986, hospital data on 717 isolates of causative microorganism from patients with urinary tract infections and background information on 562 patients were collected. the urinary tract infections were divided into 3 groups; simple infections and complicated infections with or without the use of indwelling catheter. we investigated such factors as the patients' sex, age, and drug treatments, and the isolates obtained from the infections. from 1981 to 1986, about 25% of the patients with simple infections were males and about 60 to 70% among those with complicated infections were males each year. during these 6 years, no noticeable changes occurred in sex and age distributions of patients with any type of the infections, but the species of isolates changed remarkably. in 1982 and 1983, the isolation rates of enterococcus faecalis (streptococcus spp. or streptococcus faecalis) obtained from the patients were about 8% in both of male and female patients. in 1984, the rate in females increased to 17.9%. in 1985, the rates in males and females were  14.9% and 7.6%, respectively. similar rates were also observed in 1986: 16.1 and  7.4%. the isolation rate of staphylococcus aureus in 1982 was 0.7%, as was in 1983. in however, increased to 1.7% in 1984 and to 3.2% in 1985. it was 2.5% in 1986. the isolation rate of gram-positive bacteria was 11.1% in 1982; it increased to 18.9% in 1983 and to over 20% between 1984 to 1986. among gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa form patients with complicated urinary tract infections with a catheter was high and over 20% in both 1985 and 1986. when antibacterial agents were administrated for  3 days, changes in number of species of isolates tended to be more pronounced in  complicated infections with or without the use of catheter than in simple infections. according to date obtained in 1986, when antibiotic agents were administered for 8 or more days, the changes were definitely more drastic in complicated infections than in simple ones. an upmost care in the selection of antibiotic drugs according to their antibacterial spectra and activities, therefore, appears necessary, and an attention should be paid on future changes in species of bacteria isolated from infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of fk482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a c-3 vinyl group. its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime,  and amoxicillin-clavulanate. fk482 inhibited 90% of staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012  micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. it  did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant s. aureus. fk482 inhibited 90% of enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. although 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, salmonella species, and shigella  species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, fk482 was less active than cefixime against citrobacter, enterobacter, morganella, serratia, and providencia species, with mics for many isolates of greater than 8  micrograms/ml. fk482 inhibited haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. bacteroides and pseudomonas species were resistant. fk482 was not hydrolyzed by the tem-1 and tem-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the proteus vulgaris enzyme. it had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.

TI  == ex vivo study of serum bactericidal titers and killing rates of daptomycin (ly146032) combined or not combined with amikacin compared with those of vancomycin.
AB  == twelve volunteers, in two groups of six, received daptomycin at a dose of 1 or 2  mg/kg. in addition, they received in a randomly allocated order amikacin (500 mg), daptomycin-amikacin, and vancomycin (500 mg). thirty-five clinical isolates, including staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, corynebacterium sp. group jk, and enterococcus faecalis, were tested in vitro for the measure of the serum bactericidal titers and killing rates. the mean peak concentrations of daptomycin in serum 1 h after the administration of 1 and 2 mg/kg were 11 and 20 micrograms/ml, respectively. at 24 h after the administration of 2 mg/kg, the mean level in serum was 1.9 micrograms/ml, which is higher than the mics for susceptible pathogens. daptomycin and amikacin provided identical concentrations  in serum whether given alone or in combination. among the six regimens tested, those including daptomycin provided the highest and the most prolonged serum bactericidal titers against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and e. faecalis. the killing rates measured by the killing curves were correlated with the concentration/mic and concentration/mbc ratios of daptomycin for all strains tested. significant killing occurred once the concentration of daptomycin in the  serum 4- to 6-fold the mic or 1- to 1.2-fold the mbc. the combination of daptomycin and amikacin had no effect on either the serum bactericidal titers or  the rates of killing. only vancomycin provided significant killing of the strains of corynebacterium sp. group jk.

TI  == postantibiotic effects of imipenem, norfloxacin, and amikacin in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == the postantibiotic effects (paes) of imipenem and norfloxacin were tested against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. amikacin was tested against the same bacteria except  streptococcus faecalis. for in vitro tests, a viable count-washing method was used, and for in vivo tests, the thread technique in normal mice was used. all three drugs produced paes of 1.1 to 3.8 h in vitro and 1.4 to 4.3 h in vivo against the pathogens tested. in vitro and in vivo results correlated well. the pae had a significantly (p less than 0.01 to 0.001) longer duration in vivo than  in vitro, but the pae of imipenem on staphylococcus aureus was longer in vitro. the pae was not due to residual antibiotics at the site of infection, and no pae  was obtained if at any time the antibiotic concentration at the infection site reached the mic for the pathogen tested. the results indicate that the presence of a pae may enable antibiotics to be given more intermittently without a loss of efficacy and that the pae can only be induced if the level of the antibiotic exceeds the mic for the pathogen in question for at least several minutes.

TI  == development of a meropenem susceptibility disc: drug content, preliminary interpretive and quality control criteria and potency bioassay.
AB  == laboratory studies were conducted to develop an appropriate susceptibility disc for meropenem. laboratory-prepared paper discs containing 5, 10, and 20 micrograms of meropenem were investigated. agar dilution mics and agar disc diffusion tests were performed with 367 rapidly growing clinical isolates by methods recommended by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls). agar disc diffusion tests with 10 micrograms meropenem discs acceptably  defined organisms as susceptible or resistant. the preliminary interpretive zone  size criteria for 10 micrograms meropenem discs were: susceptible, greater than or equal to 14 mm, and resistant, less than or equal to 10 mm, by application of  the nccls imipenem mic interpretive susceptible and resistant breakpoints to the  meropenem data. a total of 270 agar disc diffusion assays were performed with each of four atcc reference strains, using prototype discs (becton dickinson (bbl] containing 10 micrograms meropenem. the preliminary quality control limits  for agar disc diffusion tests with these discs are: escherichia coli atcc 25922,  28-32 mm; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, 26-31 mm; staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, 33-39 mm; and enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, 19-23 mm. further studies  are necessary to re-evaluate both the preliminary interpretive and quality control criteria before definitive limits can be established. a reproducible, large plate bioassay with enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 was developed to monitor meropenem disc potency.

TI  == activity of meropenem, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == a new carbapenem antibiotic, meropenem, was shown to be active against a large number of gram-positive bacteria. the drug inhibited penicillinase-positive and -negative, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci equally well. among the comparative antimicrobials examined, only n-formimidoyl-thienamycin (imipenem) was two to four times more active than meropenem. compared with vancomycin or methicillin, meropenem was 10-20 times more active. strains of 11 species of streptococci were highly susceptible to meropenem; the geometric mean mics of the drug for these species ranged from 0.01 to 0.04 mg/l. the agent, however, only had moderate activity against enterococcus faecalis (mean mic 5 mg/l) and ent. faecium (mean mic 11.6 mg/l). among corynebacterium jeikeium, strains were encountered that showed susceptibility to meropenem but resistance to imipenem and other beta-lactams. strains of other corynebacteria, rhodococcus equi, erysopelothrix rhusiopathiae, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus spp. all were  highly susceptible to meropenem (mean mics 0.04-0.17 mg/l). although methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by concentrations of 1-2 mg/l  of meropenem in agar dilution tests, such strains showed heteroresistance in population studies, as is typical for all beta-lactam antibiotics. in addition, the biochemical correlate of methicillin-resistance, penicillin-binding protein 2', showed low affinity for meropenem, similar to that for imipenem. meropenem was as bactericidal as imipenem and comparative bactericidal antimicrobials in killing-curve experiments. strains of ent. faecium, c. jeikeium, and l. monocytogenes were killed at a slower rate than streptococci or staphylococci.

AB  == the in vitro activities of ticarcillin, piperacillin, clavulanic acid, tazobactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 819 bacterial isolates were compared. the two beta-lactamase inhibitors, clavulanic acid and tazobactam, had little useful antibacterial activity but enhanced the activities of the penicillins against beta-lactamase-producing strains of haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus; all strains were susceptible to both combinations. both enzyme inhibitors also enhanced the activities of the penicillins against most strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., and bacteroides spp. and against occasional strains of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., and serratia marcescens. clavulanic acid frequently enhanced the activity of ticarcillin against xanthomonas maltophilia,  and tazobactam frequently enhanced the activity of piperacillin against morganella morganii. enhancement was observed primarily with strains relatively resistant to the penicillins. in general, clavulanic acid was more effective than tazobactam in enhancing penicillin activity against klebsiella spp., c. diversus, x. maltophilia, and bacteroides spp., whereas tazobactam was more effective against escherichia coli and proteeae. there was little or no enhancement of activity against enterococcus faecalis, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, or acinetobacter anitratus. clavulanic acid occasionally antagonized the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible members of the family enterobacteriaceae, but those strains were still considered susceptible to the combination. tazobactam never antagonized the activity of piperacillin. in a direct comparison of the activities of ticarcillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam, the two were equally active against h. influenzae, b. catarrhalis, and s. aureus; the latter was more active against e. faecalis. for relatively susceptible strains of members of the family enterobacteriaceae, neither combination was predictably more active than the other, but relatively resistant strains were generally more  susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam. piperacillin-tazobactam was more active than ticarcillin-clavulanate against a. hydrophila, p. aeruginosa, and p. cepacia, similar in activity against a. anitratus, and less active against x. maltophilia and bacteroides spp.

AB  == the activity of daptomycin (ly146032) and vancomycin was compared for methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant (mrsa) strains of staphylococcus  aureus and for enterococcus faecalis, using a semi-automated model that allows examination of time-kill curves with diminishing drug concentrations, thus reflecting in vivo pharmacokinetics. exposure to daptomycin resulted in rapid killing of all strains of staphylococci and enterococcus faecalis tested. methicillin-sensitive staphylococcal strains appeared marginally more susceptible than mrsa. by contrast, the activity of vancomycin appeared much reduced. for all strains, greater than 90% kill was not observed within 24 h. enterococcus faecalis was uniformly less susceptible to both agents than were staphylococci. the results suggest that despite similar values for mics, the activity of daptomycin against strains of staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis is  comparable to and may exceed that of vancomycin, although the significance of such differences is uncertain.

AB  == isogenic strains of staphylococcus aureus, differing in fibronectin binding, were constructed for studies of the contribution of fibronectin binding to the in vivo pathogenesis of staphylococcal disease. mutagenesis of s. aureus 879r4s was accomplished by mating with enterococcus faecalis fa378 that carried the transposon tn918. four low-fibronectin-binding mutants were identified that bound 24- to 35-fold less fibronectin than the parent strain did. a spectinomycin-resistant strain, r4ssp, was transduced by a bacteriophage (80 alpha) lysate propagated on a low-binding mutant of 879r4s to produce r4ssp/1536, which bound less fibronectin, contained a single copy of the transposon, and grew on spectinomycin-containing medium. using a rat model of endocarditis, we determined the distribution of s. aureus r4ssp and its transductant in normal and cardiac catheterized rats. cultures of heart tissue showed that catheterized rats challenged with the fibronectin-binding parent strain had over 250-fold more organisms in the left heart than did rats challenged with the low-binding transductant. the ability to bind fibronectin had no effect on the number of s. aureus cells cultured from other tissues. these data suggest that the ability of  s. aureus to bind fibronectin is an important factor in establishing adherence to damaged heart valves in vivo.

AB  == intravenous teicoplanin has been used to treat 23 cases of gram-positive-bacterial endocarditis, usually with 3 to 7 mg/kg every 12 h on the first day, followed by 3 to 7 mg/kg every 24 h. for some cases (staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis), the dosage was 8 to 14.4 mg/kg per day and/or other antibiotics were given. the mean duration was 48.2 days (range, 23 to 130 days). of 23 patients, 21 (91.3%) had negative cultures or were cured. a total of 18 patients were treated with teicoplanin alone; of these, 4 had surgery, and all (except 2 who relapsed) were cured. teicoplanin was combined with one or more antibiotics in five cases; in all cases appropriate cultures were negative, but three patients died during therapy or follow-up. mild renal impairment was seen in two patients; both were receiving teicoplanin in combination with an aminoglycoside. we conclude that intravenous teicoplanin administered once a day  at doses of 7 to 14 mg/kg per day is well tolerated, easy to administer, and may  represent an efficacious therapy for gram-positive-bacterial endocarditis.

TI  == evaluation of teicoplanin for treatment of endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci in 20 patients.
AB  == teicoplanin, a new glycopeptide antibiotic similar to vancomycin, was evaluated for the treatment of bacterial endocarditis in an open multicenter study from may 1985 to august 1987. a total of 20 patients with positive blood culture endocarditis received teicoplanin once daily as a mean intravenous injection of 7.3 mg/kg of body weight (range, 4.8 to 10.6 mg/kg); in 17 patients, teicoplanin  was combined with another antibiotic, usually an aminoglycoside. the mean duration of therapy was 28 days (range, 7 to 66 days). the diagnosis of endocarditis was confirmed by echocardiography or anatomical findings in 15 patients and established on the basis of clinical manifestations plus positive blood cultures in 5 patients. the tricuspid valve was involved in 11 of the 20 patients. isolates from blood were 12 staphylococcus aureus, 1 staphylococcus hominis, 1 micrococcus sedentarius, 1 enterococcus faecalis, 3 streptococcus bovis, and 2 nongroupable streptococcus sp. at the end of therapy, bacterial eradication was achieved in 17 of 20 patients (85%), and a favorable clinical outcome had occurred in 14 of 17 evaluable patients (82%). of these 14 patients,  one relapsed 4 months after the end of treatment. thus, teicoplanin was effective in 13 of 17 patients (76%). mean peak levels of teicoplanin in serum were lower,  23.1 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml, in patients who failed than in those who were cured (45.8 +/- 8.4 micrograms/ml). side effects occurred in 7 of 20 patients (35%), and required premature discontinuation of teicoplanin in 3 patients. these side effects were fever in three patients, rash in three patients, hearing loss in two patients, and increased serum transaminase levels in two patients. this study demonstrates the efficacy of teicoplanin in the treatment of endocarditis and the need for achieving peak levels in serum close to 40 micrograms/ml. teicoplanin should now be further evaluated in endocarditis caused by gram-positive cocci means of controlled comparative study with standard therapy.

AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

AB  == investigations of the clinical role of enterococci have been limited largely to enterococcal bacteremia and endocarditis and have not distinguished between the various species of enterococci. to characterize the full spectrum of enterococcal disease and to determine whether clinically important differences exist among infections and/or instances of colonization (infections/colonizations) by the various enterococcal species, cases of enterococcal infection/colonization diagnosed at the dallas veterans administration medical center (dvamc) in 1986 were reviewed. during this period, 220 enterococcus faecalis, 21 enterococcus faecium, 12 enterococcus avium, and no enterococcus durans isolates were identified in clinical specimens (other than stool) submitted to the dvamc microbiology laboratory. clinical characteristics of cases of infection/colonization by the three species of enterococci were similar and did not vary significantly when blood stream invasion occurred. nevertheless, mortality data and therapeutic response rates suggested differences in virulence  of the three enterococcal species. enterococcal infections/colonizations (including bacteremia) frequently were polymicrobial. although enterobacteriaceae were the most common copathogens identified overall, staphylococcus aureus was the most common copathogen in bloodstream infections. e. avium was more resistant than e. faecalis or e. faecium to penicillin g and ampicillin and less resistant  to most other antimicrobial agents. the results of this investigation suggest that enterococci are a heterogeneous group of bacteria that should not be treated as a single entity in clinical investigations.

TI  == [reactivity of human lymphocytes to yeast-like and mold fungi].
AB  == the capacity of the allergens of mold fungi (rhizopus nigricans, mucor pusillus,  alternaria tenuis, cladosporum herbarum, fusarium oxysporum) and yeast-like fungi (candida albicans) to induce the production of lymphokins by human lymphocytes was studied. all these preparations were active in reactions with lymphocytes obtained from adult donors, but did not activate lymphocytes of newborns (obtained from umbilical blood). in equal doses (10 micrograms/ml) c. albicans allergen was more active than the preparations of mold fungi. the capacity of bacterial allergens to stimulate human lymphocytes was found to be either more pronounced (in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes) than that of the preparation of c. albicans or equal to it (in streptococcus faecalis). the results thus obtained may be regarded as the manifestation of immunological contacts with the antigens of different microorganisms, as well as the evidence of the immunological nature of lymphocytic reactions to preparations intended for use in clinical allergology.

AB  == we made an attempt to treat with cefmetazole (cmz) 25 patients who developed severe infectious diseases while suffering with granulocytopenia associated with  the treatment of malignant hematological disorders. 1. determination of bacteriological efficacy while 20 strains were isolated and identified from 15 patients, no significant bacteria were detected in 9 patients. isolates obtained  were: 5 strains of enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of haemophilus influenzae, 2  strains of staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 strains of klebsiella oxytoca, 2 strains of staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of neisseria sp., pseudomonas maltophilia, enterobacter sp., alpha-streptococcus, beta-streptococcus and gram-positive cocci. causative organisms were eradicated or markedly in 7 of the  15 patients from whom bacteria were isolated. clinical findings, including fever, revealed that none of the patients, in whom bacteriological efficacy was determined to be poor, exhibited sufficient clinical response. e. faecalis was isolated from 4 of 6 patients bacteriologically determined to have no response. 2. as for 23 patients, who were found to be evaluable among the 25 patients, 8 (34.8%), 4 (17.4%), 4 (17.4%), and 7 (30.4%) demonstrated excellent, good, fair and poor responses, respectively, showing a 69.6% efficacy rate which indicates a sum of percentages of patients with excellent, good and fair responses. 3. while  an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained for 3 patients with number of peripheral neutrophils less than 500/mm3 before the beginning of cmz administration, only an efficacy rate of 66.7% was obtained for 15 patients with neutrophils more than 500/mm3.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo activity of cefpirome (hr 810) against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis.
AB  == with cefpirome (hr 810) the mics for both methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and for streptococcus faecalis were 8.0 mg/l. at 4 x mic, cefpirome killed mrsa as rapidly as did vancomycin while for enterococci, cefpirome, vancomycin or ampicillin alone were not bactericidal. however, all agents were bactericidal when combined with 2 mg/l of gentamicin, although gentamicin combined with cefpirome showed a smaller decrease in cfu/ml than the combination  with ampicillin or vancomycin. a mouse thigh infection model was developed in which the thigh muscle was infected with bacteria and either no therapy or concurrent antibiotic therapy was initiated. on the subsequent day, the entire thigh muscle was quantitatively cultured. in this model, the numbers of enterococci at the infection site at 24 h were reduced by 2.1 logs with no treatment, 2.6 with cefpirome (25 mg/kg/day), 2.8 with ampicillin (150 mg/kg/day), and 2.7 with vancomycin (25 mg/kg/day). for mrsa the reductions were  1.1 logs with no therapy, 2.8 with vancomycin, and 3.0 with cefpirome. the apparent enhanced in-vivo activity of cefpirome for mrsa argues for further evaluation of this antibiotic for treatment of mrsa and other gram-positive cocci, including enterococci.

TI  == modification of homogeneous resistance in a methicillin-resistant strain of staphylococcus aureus by acquisition of a beta-lactamase encoding plasmid.
AB  == nearly all clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) are heterogeneously resistant and produce beta-lactamases which generally  are plasmid mediated. in order to study the role of beta-lactamase plasmids in the expression of methicillin resistance, a beta-lactamase plasmid from enterococcus faecalis hh22 (pbem10) was transferred into a homogeneously resistant, beta-lactamase-negative strain of mrsa (musc284). by single disc diffusion testing at 42 degrees c, beta-lactamase producing transconjugants (sa-mm1) were found to be more susceptible than the parent strain to methicillin, imipenem, sch 34343 and cloxacillin, but more resistant to piperacillin. the heterogeneity observed in transconjugants was not affected by the addition of clavulanic acid, indicating that beta-lactamase itself was not responsible for this effect. by population analysis over 50% of musc284 colonies and less than 1% of sa-mm1 colonies remained viable after incubation at 42 degrees c in agar plates containing 25 mg/l of cloxacillin. cured derivatives of sa-mm1 reverted to homogeneous resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics as observed in the initial parenteral strain musc284. thus, the introduction of a beta-lactamase coding plasmid into a homogeneously resistant mrsa yielded transconjugants which resembled heterogeneously resistant strains of mrsa. these results suggest that regulatory genes, capable of altering the expression of methicillin resistance, may be located on beta-lactamase plasmids commonly found in these organisms.

TI  == intra-abdominal sepsis after hepatic resection.
AB  == one hundred and thirty hepatic resections performed over an 8-year period were reviewed for evidence of postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis. of 126 patients who survived for more than 24 hours after operation, 36 developed culture positive intra-abdominal collections (28.6%). significant independent variables associated with the development of intra-abdominal sepsis were diagnoses of trauma or cholangiocarcinoma, and the need for reoperation to control hemorrhage  during the postoperative period. before 1984, infected fluid collections were treated predominantly by operative drainage, but this has largely been replaced by percutaneous methods, which have proven effective in most cases. eighteen (50%) of the infections were caused by a mixed bacterial culture, with streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli being the most common isolates. six patients with clinical signs of sepsis had a sterile fluid collection drained with complete relief of symptoms. this review suggests that intra-abdominal sepsis is a frequent complication after hepatic resection, and can often be managed successfully by nonoperative percutaneous drainage.

TI  == new approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of infective endocarditis: review of 100 consecutive cases.
AB  == to assess the effect of our new, more aggressive approach to treating infective endocarditis, we retrospectively reviewed our recent experience with this disease. between 1983 and 1989, we treated 100 patients with endocarditis, in 94  of whom the diagnosis was confirmed. fifty-four (57%) of the 94 patients had native valve endocarditis, and the other 40 patients (43%) had prosthetic valve endocarditis. the patients' mean ages were 50 years for native valve disease and  58 years for prosthetic valve disease (p < 0.05). the male-to-female ratio was 4:1. among the patients with confirmed endocarditis, 87 (93%) had significant underlying risk factors for endocarditis. upon physical examination of the 94 patients, 16 (17%) were afebrile, 15 (16%) had negative blood cultures, and 26 (28%) had no cardiovascular symptoms or immunologic findings. echocardiography was of limited value: its sensitivity was 56% for native valve endocarditis and 33% for prosthetic valve endocarditis. the ratio of affected valves was 5 aortic:4 mitral: 1 tricuspid in both forms of the disease. viridans streptococcus was isolated in 23 (25%) of the confirmed cases, enterococcus faecalis in 17 (18%), staphylococcus aureus in 13 (14%), and coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 14 (15%). gram-negative, anaerobic, and fungal organisms accounted for only 13 (14%) of the confirmed cases. the mean duration of intravenous therapy was 29 days. twenty (37%) of the native valve patients and 16 (40%) of the prosthetic valve patients received antibiotics on an outpatient basis. vancomycin was used in 44 (47%) of the cases, nafcillin or ampicillin in 40 (44%), and other beta-lactam agents in 9 (10%). the mean hospital stay was significantly longer for prosthetic valve endocarditis patients than for those with native valve disease (29 versus 23 days; p < 0.01). cardiac catheterization was performed in 9 native valve patients (17%) and 6 prosthetic valve patients (15%). valve surgery  was performed in 33 native valve patients (61%) and 22 prosthetic valve patients  (55%). failure, defined as in-hospital death or recurrent endocarditis, accounted for 14 (28%) of the native valve cases (17% death and 11% relapse) and 8 (20%) of the prosthetic valve cases (10% death and 10% relapse), for an overall failure rate of 24%. the rate of failure was independent of the infecting pathogen or the type of antimicrobial therapy applied. our experience verified that, in many patients with significant underlying risk factors, the diagnosis of endocarditis  may be made on an empiric basis.

AB  == enterococcus faecium bm4165 and bm4178, isolated from immunocompromised patients, one treated with vancomycin, were inducibly resistant to high levels of the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin but susceptible to the new lipopeptide daptomycin (ly146032). strain bm4165 was also resistant to macrolidelincosamide-streptogramin b-type (mls) antibiotics. the genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides and to mls antibiotics in strain bm4165 were carried  on plasmids pip819 and pip821, respectively; pip819 also carried genes that encoded resistance to mls antibiotics. the two plasmids, which were distinct although related, were self-transferable to other e. faecium strains. plasmid pip819 could also conjugate to e. faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, s. pyogenes, s. lactis, and listeria monocytogenes, in which it conferred inducible glycopeptide resistance, but not to s. aureus. glycopeptide-inactivating activity was not detected, and the biochemical mechanism of resistance remains unknown. based on this first report of transferable resistance to glycopeptides, we anticipate dissemination of resistance to these antibiotics in gram-positive cocci and bacilli in which it can be phenotypically expressed.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == in vivo antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == the therapeutic activities of orally administered fk482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of  bacteria in mice and rabbits. in systemic infections in mice, oral fk482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (ccl) and more effective than oral cephalexin (cex) against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis infections. however, fk482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against e. coli infection in mice,  and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given ccl. in comparison with ccl, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given fk482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. in local infections in rabbits, a species in which fk482 was better absorbed than in mice, fk482 was more effective than ccl, cex or amoxicillin (ampc). against pneumonia induced by s. aureus or streptococcus pyogenes, fk482 was as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. in the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, fk482 was superior to ccl and ampc against methicillin-resistant s. aureus infection, as effective as ampc and more effective than ccl against enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (cfix) and more effective than ccl and ampc against e. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and production of inhibitory substances among bacterial strains isolated from the oral cavities of balb/c mice.
AB  == in the oral cavities of balb/c mice, microbial population levels are regulated by multifactorial processes. factors include the production of inhibitory substances and the exchange of genetic material. in this work, 371 isolates from different sites (saliva, tongue, teeth, and mucosa) of the oral cavities of balb/c mice were screened for resistance to antibiotics and antimicrobial activity. antibiotic-resistant strains represented 25% of the total flora. among the predominant species, all the s. faecalis isolates showed multiresistance, and 23% of the lactobacillus murinus isolates and 15% of the staphylococcus aureus were resistant to at least one antibiotic. resistance to aminoglycosides (neomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin) was most frequently encountered. in s. faecalis, high levels of resistance were recorded to neomycin and streptomycin but not to gentamicin or kanamycin. macrolides (m), lincosamides (l), streptogramin b (s), tetracycline (tc), and chloramphenicol (cm) resistance was also present in multiresistance patterns, especially among s. faecalis isolates.  hemolytic (hly+) streptococci were less resistant to mls, tc, and cm than were non-hemolytic (hly-) isolates. resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was detected only among staphylococci and with a low prevalence (4%). the frequencies of strains producing antimicrobial substances against the indicator strains (s. mutans lg-1, s. sanguis ny 101, and a. viscosus ny 1) were high for l. murinus (76%) and s. faecalis (57% for hly- and 90% for hly+), but low for s. aureus (7%). these results indicate that the indigenous oral flora could interfere with  colonization by allochthonous micro-organisms and that resistance patterns should be taken into account for the elimination of the oral indigenous flora by antibiotic treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the uptake of adriamycin (adm) by eucaryotic and procaryotic cells and the interaction of the antibiotic with structurally organized dna were investigated.  the aim of this work was to understand why adm is endowed with very low antibiotic activity in spite of being highly cytotoxic for mammalian cells, and to get a further insight into the mechanism of action of this compound. spectrophotometric, fluorometric, chiroptical, and electron microscopic techniques were used. the drug was shown to concentrate in mammalian cells but failed to do so in bacteria and penetrated rather poorly in candida albicans. the chromatin binding affinity of adm appeared to be substantially reduced with respect to the affinity for free dna. complex stereochemistry was also influenced by the presence of nucleosomal arrangements in the polynucleotide. in addition, evidence was obtained that the antibiotic tended to accumulate at specific (linker) chromatin regions and to cause extensive compaction of organized dna. the observed phenomena may play a relevant role in the mode of drug action in eucaryotic cells and help to explain the lack of antibacterial activity by adm in spite of the apparent attainment of great enough intracellular levels to affect dna template function.

TI  == laboratory evaluation of disposable and reusable disinfectant cloths for cleaning food contact surfaces.
AB  == a comparison of five methods of cleaning formica surfaces contaminated with bacteria dried in milk has been carried out. a standardized procedure was developed, and impression plates were found to be at least as sensitive as a swab-rinse method for detecting bacteria on the surfaces. the most satisfactory results were obtained with one type of disposable alcohol-impregnated wipe and with a detergent/hypochlorite solution applied with paper. a reusable cloth impregnated with disinfectant initially performed well against all test organisms, but was less reliable against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus  faecalis, after the cloth had been used and rinsed several times. the importance  of introducing methods to reduce the high risk of cross-contamination presently associated with the use of wiping cloths in catering premises is stressed.

TI  == an in vitro evaluation of hre 664, a novel penem antibiotic.
AB  == hre 664 is a novel parenteral penem with a broad antimicrobial spectrum. in this  study, hre 664 inhibited 90% of enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci at less than or equal to 0.13 microgram/ml, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, enterococci at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, and streptococci at less than or equal to 0.13 microgram/ml. all strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant (mics were greater than 32 micrograms/ml). hre 664 exhibited a minimal inoculum effect and good bactericidal activity with all organisms tested except an oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. with the latter, there was a marked inoculum effect and no on-scale bactericidal endpoints. no measurable hydrolysis of hre 664 occurred with any of  the five gram-negative bacterial beta-lactamases tested. when stored at -20 degrees c, hre 664 showed no significant loss of activity for up to 6 wk, but detectable deterioration occurred thereafter. at -60 degrees c, no loss in hre 664 potency was observed for up to 12 wk. proposed hre 664 mic quality control parameters are: 0.03-0.13 microgram/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213, 0.25-1.0 micrograms/ml for escherichia coli 25922, and 2.0-8.0 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212.

TI  == structural relationships between senfolomycins and paulomycins.
AB  == senfolomycins a and b (antimicrob. agents chemother.-1965: 828-831, 1966) are two antibacterial agents with physico-chemical and biological properties similar to those of paulomycin. recent studies indicate that senfolomycin a (c29h36n2o16s, mw 700) has molecular composition and fast atom bombardment ms fragmentation pattern identical to those of paulomycin e. extensive nmr work indicates that the two antibiotics, which have been separated by hplc and tlc, differ only in the stereochemistry of the och3 group present in their respective sugar moieties. indirect evident suggests that senfolomycin b is dihydrosenfolomycin a (c29h38n2o16s, mw 702) and in this respect it is related to paulomycin f. the proposed structures for senfolomycins a and b are discussed.

TI  == development of resistance to nalidixic acid and the fluoroquinolones after the introduction of norfloxacin and ofloxacin.
AB  == since 1975, the group resistenz of the paul-ehrlich-gesellschaft fur chemotherapie has monitored the development of resistance in isolates of members  of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and enterococcus faecalis in the federal republic of germany, west berlin, austria, and switzerland. despite a marked increase in the use of 4-quinolones, there was no increase in the percentages of nalidixic acid-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae between 1975 and 1986. however, different bacterial species showed considerable variation, and there were also considerable differences in the percentages of nalidixic acid-resistant strains of enterobacteriaceae from different centers. the frequency of resistance to fluoroquinolones was unchanged  from 1983 to 1986 and was less than 4% in all species except p. aeruginosa. in this species, there was an increase from about 3 to 10% from 1983 to 1986 for strains for which the mic was fourfold above the mode mic of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, and ofloxacin.

TI  == ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole.
AB  == ciprofloxacin has a reduced activity against anaerobic pathogens. therefore, a combination of ciprofloxacin with an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, such as metronidazole, seems to be interesting for the treatment of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections. high metronidazole concentrations (10 mg/l or 40 mg/l) neither affected the bactericidal efficacy of ciprofloxacin on aerobic pathogens, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis, nor on the anaerobic pathogens clostridium  perfringens and clostridium difficile, as demonstrated by kill-kinetic curves. the same high concentrations, as well as lower therapeutically achievable concentration (2 mg/l or 5 mg/l) of metronidazole in combination with ciprofloxacin were slightly more potent for the tested clostridia than ciprofloxacin or metronidazole alone.

TI  == synergy between spiramycin and metronidazole in the treatment of polymicrobial infections.
AB  == the in-vitro and in-vivo activity of metronidazole and spiramycin, singly or in combination, was tested in the eradication of infection caused by bacteroides spp. alone and in combination with neisseria gonorrhoea, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes or str. faecalis. the in-vitro tests consisted of determinations of the mics with or without the addition of a constant amount of the other antimicrobials. the mics of metronidazole for b. melaninogenicus, b. fragilis and b. bivius were significantly reduced by the addition of 0.125 mg/l spiramycin. the in-vivo tests were carried out in mice and consisted of measurements of the effects of the antimicrobial agents on the bacterial contents of abscesses induced by subcutaneous injection of bacterial suspension. combined  therapy of mixed infections showed further significant reduction of the numbers of bacteroides spp. in seven of 12 combinations and of the aerobic and facultative bacteria in four of 12 combinations. furthermore, a reduction in the  number of facultative anaerobes was noted in mixed infections with bacteroides spp. which were treated with metronidazole alone. the synergy in vitro and in vivo between metronidazole and spiramycin may have important clinical implications in the treatment of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infections.

AB  == reliability of the cefamandole (cmd) disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of mics was studied using various clinical isolates totaling 246 strains with showa discs (8 mm diameter containing 30 micrograms of cmd). clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the cmd disc tests, which is normally used in japan, was also evaluated to determine whether this system would be suitable or not for the evaluation of a proper dose  of administration. the results obtained with the disc method were compared with mics determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. the results of the cmd disc susceptibility test were well correlated with mics, showing the reliability of the disc method to estimate approximate values of mics. break points in mic values proposed for the classification of bacteria into 4 categories of susceptibility are () mic less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml. only 4 (1.6%) out the 246 strains tested showed false positive results and 11 (4.5%) showed false negative results, showing the excellent reliability of this test. in this study,  approximately 90% of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis isolated from clinical materials randomly were inhibited by cmd at concentrations less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. proteus vulgaris and enterobacter aerogenes were sensitive to cmd at 67 and 69% of strains, respectively, at concentrations below 6.25 micrograms/ml. cmd was not active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens and enterococcus faecalis. about 90% of staphylococcus aureus were inhibited at dose levels smaller than 6.25 micrograms/ml and 70% of the strains at levels less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. susceptibilities to 15 micrograms/ml cmd of highly methicillin-resistant strains  (mic greater than 30 micrograms/ml) of s. aureus were examined. ten of 12 strains examined were found susceptible to cmd, but only 6 of the 12 to cefmetazole. imipenem/cilastatin was effective to 5 of the 12 strains at levels lower than 3 micrograms/ml and to one at a level less than 15 micrograms/ml. minocycline was effective against 11 strains at concentrations below 2 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == microbial spoilage of pre-cooked potato-topped pies.
AB  == the ecological succession of bacteria which developed in pre-cooked potato-topped pies stored at two different temperatures was examined. bacillus, streptococcus and staphylococcus-micrococcus spp. were the predominant organisms isolated from  freshly prepared pies and those stored at 4 degrees and 37 degrees c. none of these groups of bacteria caused significant biodeterioration of pies held at 4 degrees c, but all groups grew well in pies stored at 37 degrees c and achieved counts of ca 10(8)/g of sample. bacillus spp. were the first group to grow, followed by streptococcus and staphylococcus-micrococcus spp. growth which occurred at 37 degrees c did so at the expense of glucose, lactate accumulated and the ph of pie components decreased. amylase activity detected in all pie components during storage was associated with the growth of bacillus spp. and probably supplemented glucose already present in pies, by hydrolytic cleavage of  potato, flour or binder starches. spoilage caused by growth and activity of the bacteria isolated was not associated with visual signs of biodeterioration, nor production of 'off' odour usually associated with spoilage of meats. these results suggest that pre-cooked potato-topped pies held at inappropriate temperatures represent a potential public health risk.

AB  == a total of 122 bacterial strains isolated from urine specimens of 113 female patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis were used for the study of beta-lactamase production and their susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents was determined. beta-lactamase activity was qualitatively determined by a  paper strip acidimetric method with benzylpenicillin as substrate and by chromogenic cephalosporin methods using pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline cephalosporin or nitrocefin as substrate. susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, including ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, cephalothin, gentamicin, minocycline, fosfomycin, pipemidic acid and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim was examined by a disc method. the beta-lactamase-producing strains detected by at least one of the three tests were found in 18 of 105 escherichia coli isolates and in the single strain of enterobacter cloacae dermidis, 3 enterococcus faecalis and 1 staphylococcus aureus produced beta-lactamase. the isolation rate  of strains resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin and cephalothin in the beta-lactamase-producing strains was significantly higher than that in the non-beta-lactamase-producing strains (p less than 0.01). these results suggest that beta-lactamase plays an important role in developing resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infection as well as complicated infection.

TI  == [clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  == in vitro activities of latamoxef (lmox) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. lmox was highly active against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and proteus vulgaris with mic values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. it was also active against enterobacter aerogenes with mic80  of 1.56 micrograms/ml. lmox was less active against serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. it was also less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, showing mic80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. lmox was not active against enterococcus faecalis and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the reliability of the lmox disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of lmox. these disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with mics, hence the lmox disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of lmox. for the interpretation of lmox disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of showa discs used on staphylococcus were relatively large compared to mics determined, probably due to decarboxylation of lmox sodium salt in the discs. however, those of difco discs were not, because difco discs use lmox ammonium salt. both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters  compared to mics determined against p. aeruginosa. using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for staphylococcus and p. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate mics. a 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in usa and europe, but a 4 category system is  generally used in japan. the 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to mic values as follows:  resistant (r) mic greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (i) mic 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (s) mic less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. the 4 category system uses break points as follows: mic less than  or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, mic greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) mic greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) mic greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == production of staphylococcal enterotoxin in mixed cultures.
AB  == two staphylococcus aureus strains were grown in brain-heart infusion (bhi) broth  and a meat medium with bacillus cereus, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. both s. aureus strains grew well and produced enterotoxin in the presence of s. faecalis in bhi broth; however, enterotoxin production was observable in the meat medium only when the s. aureus inoculum was greater than the s. faecalis inoculum. s. aureus fri-100 grown with b. cereus produced enterotoxin in both media only when the s. aureus inoculum was much higher than the b. cereus inoculum (10 versus 10(4) cfu), whereas s. aureus fri-196e produced enterotoxin in both media at all inoculum combinations except in the meat medium, when the inocula of the two organisms were the same. s. aureus grown with e. coli in bhi broth produced enterotoxin at all inoculum combinations except when the e. coli inoculum was greater than the s. aureus inoculum; however, in the meat medium, enterotoxin was produced only when the s.  aureus inoculum was much greater than the e. coli inoculum (10 versus 10(4) cfu), s. aureus fri-100 grown with p. aeruginosa in either medium produced enterotoxin  only when the s. aureus inoculum was much greater than the p. aeruginosa inoculum (10 versus 10(3) or 10(4) cfu). it can be concluded from these results that enterotoxin production is unlikely in mixed cultures unless the staphylococci outnumber the other contaminating organisms.

TI  == quality control limits for teicoplanin susceptibility tests and confirmation of disk diffusion interpretive criteria.
AB  == for monitoring the performance of teicoplanin susceptibility tests, the following quality control limits are recommended: staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, mic of  0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, mic of 0.06 to 0.25  micrograms/ml; and s. aureus atcc 25923, zones 15 to 19 mm in diameter (30-micrograms disks). however, some lots of mueller-hinton agar provided unusually large zones of inhibition with both vancomycin and teicoplanin disks, and these lots should be excluded before routine use. teicoplanin and vancomycin  differed only in their activity against oxacillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus haemolyticus, which had decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin but were fully susceptible to vancomycin. for tests with 30-micrograms teicoplanin disks, zones less than or equal to 10 and greater than or equal to 14 mm in diameter represent resistant and susceptible breakpoints, respectively.

TI  == patterns of wound colonisation in patients with peripheral vascular disease.
AB  == the bacterial colonisation of ulcers related to vascular disease, amputation sites and sites of surgical vascular repair was studied in 122 patients with vascular disorders. wounds were graded clinically on the basis of inflammation, oedema and exudate. they were sampled at weekly intervals in order to determine the duration of colonisation. the significance of potential pathogens was assessed. vascular ulcers were of low mean wound grade (1.87), short duration (1.58 weeks) and potential pathogens were isolated from 82% of 38 wounds. amputation sites were of a higher mean wound grade (2.48) and longer duration (2.52 weeks) when compared to vascular ulcers. potential pathogens were isolated  from 69% of 42 amputation sites. sites of surgical vascular repair were similar to amputation sites with respect to mean wound grade (2.33) but of a mean duration (1.69 weeks) similar to that of vascular ulcers. potential pathogens were isolated from 50% of 42 surgical vascular repair sites but they were not evenly distributed among limb (33%), groin (55%) and abdominal wounds (71%). coliforms were isolated from similar numbers of all wounds. pseudomonas spp., staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were evenly distributed with respect to the site of isolation. pseudomonas spp. and s. aureus were associated  more commonly with vascular ulcers and s. faecalis with sites of surgical vascular repair. the use of topical antiseptics and/or systemic antimicrobial agents had a minimal effect in reducing colonisation/infection in the wounds studied.

AB  == ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl  before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. five strains each of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, streptococcus  (enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain jk, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested.  serum bactericidal activities (sbas) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or  equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, a. calcoaceticus, and k. pneumoniae. l. monocytogenes, serratia marcescens, and p. aeruginosa had lower sbas. very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and streptococcus faecalis. the study of the killing rate in serum  confirmed these results. postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. the duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, l. monocytogenes, p. aeruginosa, a. calcoaceticus, k. pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens. m. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. no postantibiotic effect was observed with streptococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain jk, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and sbas against susceptible pathogens. prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. no signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.

TI  == penetration of bacteria and spermatozoa into bovine cervical mucus.
AB  == it has been reported that bacteria may attach to motile spermatozoa, be carried through the cervix and uterus to the fallopian tubes, and cause acute salpingitis. in an attempt to mimic these conditions in vitro, we incubated escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus with motile spermatozoa which then were allowed to migrate  through a capillary filled with bovine cervical mucus. after satisfactory sperm migration through the mucus, the capillaries were broken and cultured at different distances from the original insemination site. mucus fractions in proximity to bacterial inocula grew varying amounts of the pathogens. more distal fractions of mucus columns were generally culture-negative even though they contained motile sperm which had been exposed to bacteria. migration of spermatozoa exposed to bacteria through bovine cervical mucus did not result in enhanced bacterial penetration.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpirome, a new cephalosporin with a broad antimicrobial spectrum.
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefpirome (hr 810), a new cephalosporin antibiotic having a 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine group in the 3-position side chain, was compared with in vitro activities of 5 other cephalosporins. hr 810 showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria when tested using 71 standard strains and 876 clinical isolates. hr 810  inhibited 70% of the clinically isolated staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis strains when used at 0.59-0.84 microgram/ml, 2- to 25-fold lower than values of reference antibiotics, and the compound was also highly effective against enterococcus faecalis which is relatively resistant to most of the existing cephem antibiotics. the activity of hr 810 against enterobacteriaceae members (11 species), based on its minimal inhibitory concentrations inhibiting 90% of bacterial growth (mic90s), was the highest among the cephalosporins used.  especially against enterobacter species and citrobacter freundii, the mic90s of the compound were 4- to 64-fold lower than the values of the other antibiotics. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, hr 810 was as active as cefoperazone, an antipseudomonal agent. the minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of hr 810 were equal to or only 2-fold greater than the mics for most of 12 standard strains tested. the compound markedly decreased viable bacterial counts at its mics, thus showing strong bactericidal activities. the in vitro activity of hr 810 was not affected by ph or human serum content of agar media, but the activity against gram-negative bacteria was lowered as the inoculum size increased.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant of the pneumococcal transposon tn1545: evolutionary relationships and transcriptional analysis of apha-3 genes.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant apha-3 encoded by transposon tn1545 from streptococcus pneumoniae was determined and compared to those of plasmids pjh1 and pip1433 from streptococcus faecalis and campylobacter  coli, respectively. the three sequences were found to be identical and differed by two substitutions and the deletion of a codon from that of plasmid psh2 from staphylococcus aureus. comparison of the 5' noncoding sequences indicated that the regions containing the apha-3 gene in pjh1 and in tn1545 evolved independently by deletion from a sequence similar to that found in pip1433. in the latter plasmid, apha-3 is transcribed from a promoter, p1, which is flanked by two 12-base pair direct repeats. the rearrangement observed in pjh1 removed one of these recombinogenic sites and altered the -10 and 3' flanking sequences of p1. the promoter thus generated. p1', allows expression of similar level of kanamycin resistance as p1. however, fusion experiments carried out with a promotorless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene indicated that the canonical  promoter p1 is significantly less efficient than p1'. from analysis of the thermodynamic properties of these promoters, we conclude that this difference in  strength reflects the melting properties of the -10 sequences. the transition from pip1433 to pjh1 may correspond to the progression of a molecule structurally unstable to a more stable one combined with the need to maintain an efficient promoter upstream of the apha-3 gene. the deletion event in tn1545, which occurred between the two 12-base pair directly repeated sequences, removed p1 in  its entirety.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == nine hundred seventy cases of childhood bacterial meningitis treated at 107 institutions in japan from 1979 through 1984 were studied using questionnaire. the number of cases that underwent antimicrobial monotherapy remained nearly constant during the study period, but cases of therapies with beta-lactam combined with aminoglycosides (ags) decreased in number and a gradual increase in the use of beta-lactam combined with non-ags antibiotics including beta-lactam (non ags) was observed. a trend showing decrease in case fatality rate (cfr) was  observed except that cfr for gram-positive bacterial infections treated with beta-lactam + ags remained at a same level. cases treated with antibiotics were classified into 3 groups according to major etiological pathogens. cases with staphylococcus aureus gave a poor prognosis, among 27 total cases, cfr was 28.6%  (2/7) with monotherapy, 50.0% (6/12) with beta-lactam + ags and 37.5% (3/8) with  beta-lactam + non ags (p less than 0.1). among 100 cases of group b streptococcus (gbs), cfr was 20.0% as a whole, 17.3% (9/52) for monotherapy and 34.5% (10/29) for beta-lactam + ags (p less than 0.1). among 198 cases of streptococcus pneumoniae, cfr was 12.1% as a whole, and was 12.3% (18/146) with monotherapy. cfr for the cases treated with beta-lactam + ags was 20.8% (5/24) and with beta-lactam + non ags was 3.6% (1/28) (p less than 0.1). cfr for 292 cases of haemophilus influenzae meningitis was fairly low, and was 6.1% (9/148) with monotherapy, 7.4% (5/68) with beta-lactam + ags and 3.9% (3/76) with beta-lactam  + non ags, thus very slight differences were observed among the 3 groups of treatment. among 111 cases of escherichia coli, monotherapy and beta-lactam + non ags gave 6.5% (2/31) cfr, and 5.6% (1/18) cfr, respectively, whereas beta-lactam  + ags showed cfr of 19.4% (12/62), demonstrating a significant difference tendency (p less than 0.1). similar tendencies were observed in the cases of listeria monocytogenes, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis. contrary to the high cfr observed with the beta-lactam + ags treatment, significantly low cfr was frequently obtained in cases treated with a combination of penicillins with cephalosporins including latamoxef or beta-lactam with chloramphenicol. infections with gbs, e. coli, and p. mirabilis  occurred largely in the age between 0 to 6 months and cfr was especially high in  the very young.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == bacterial isolates from patients with pulmonary infections have been collected over the last 4 years in collaboration with investigators at 14 hospitals in various parts of japan to study isolation frequency of pathogens from patients and drug susceptibilities of these isolates. possible causative pathogens mainly  isolated from sputum of patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected during a period from september 1984 to march 1985. we first determined  types of respiratory diseases and found that, between 1981 and 1983, 57.9 approximately 64.5% of the examined diseases were chronic respiratory infections  such as chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis, and that these infections including diffuse panbronchiolitis accounted for 63.1% in 1984.  bacterial pneumonia was found to be 24.8% in 1981, but it was 11.0% in 1983 and 15.1% in 1984. these results seemed to reflect decreases in the occurrence of bacterial pneumonia in young population. we then investigated the correlations between these infections and isolates and found that distributions of causative organisms of chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis during the 4 years were similar while the detection rate of staphylococcus aureus from bacterial pneumonia increased in 1982 and 1983, and that of gram-positive organisms such as enterococcus faecalis rose in 1984. branhamella catarrhalis was considered to be  a non-pathogenic organism normally harbored in the upper respiratory tract. recently, however, respiratory infections caused by this organism have been reported by some investigators. in our research also, this gram-negative diplococcus was isolated as a causative organism of respiratory infections as 6 strains were found in 1983 and 29 strains in 1984, hence an increase was observed.

TI  == the effect of transferrin and lysozyme on antibacterial activity of amniotic fluid.
AB  == amniotic fluid obtained from normal full term gestation inhibited the growth of e. coli, staph. aureus and b. subtilis, while ps. aeruginosa, str. faecalis and str. agalactiae proliferated readily in amniotic fluid. but when amniotic fluid was heated at 100 degrees c for 5 minutes, its antibacterial activity was completely lost. the levels of transferrin and lysozyme in amniotic fluid at term were determined to be 29.1 +/- 17.6 mg/100 ml (n = 90) and 19.1 +/- 8.3 micrograms/ml (n = 145), respectively. antibacterial activity against e. coli was restored by adding transferrin into heat-treated amniotic fluid at a concentration of 250 mg/100 ml or higher, but simultaneous addition of transferrin and sufficient concentration of iron to form a transferrin-iron complex resulted in the loss of antibacterial activities. when lysozyme was added to the amniotic fluid, which had lost its antibacterial activity through exposure to heat, the antibacterial effect on b. subtilis was restored. the growth of staph. aureus in heat-treated amniotic fluid was inhibited by the concomitant addition of lysozyme and aminobenzyl penicillin.

TI  == suppurative thrombophlebitis: correlation between pathogen and underlying disease.
AB  == we identified 29 episodes of suppurative thrombophlebitis in 27 patients admitted to a large general hospital between may 1980 and may 1984. in 25 patients, the intravenous cannulae had been in place for more than 3 days. streptococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa or one of the enterobacteriaceae were implicated in 14 patients. all these patients had recently undergone abdominal surgery or had a major intra-abdominal inflammatory process at the time they developed thrombophlebitis. the remaining 13 patients were infected with staphylococcus aureus, other gram-positive cocci or candida species. only two of these had an active abdominal process at the time of their infection (chi 2 = 16.08, p less than 0.001). there is an apparent association between phlebitis caused by enteric organisms and active intra-abdominal pathology. there were two deaths related to  delayed or deferred surgery. suppurative thrombophlebitis is a lethal, preventable nosocomial infection that requires urgent surgical intervention.

AB  == plasmids coding for chloramphenicol resistance, five isolated from streptococci of groups a, b, and g, ten from enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus  faecium), and two from staphylococci, were tested for sequence homology with the  chloramphenicol resistance gene of pip501, a 30-kb plasmid originally isolated from a group b streptococcus. the 6.3-kb hindiii fragment of pip501, known to carry the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was cloned into pbr322. a 1.6-kb portion of the cloned fragment, which included most of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was used as probe in dna-dna hybridization experiments. sequence homology was detected between the probe and four of the streptococcal, seven of the enterococcal, and one of the staphylococcal plasmids. the absence of hybridization between this probe and one plasmid isolated from a group b streptococcus, as well as three isolated from e. faecalis, indicated that there are at least two different plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance determinants  in the streptococci and in the enterococci.

TI  == sepsis and cholestasis: the in vitro effects of bacterial products on 14c-taurocholate uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.
AB  == bacterial endotoxins are known to be an important cause of cholestasis, yet not all organisms that cause cholestasis produce endotoxins. in order to determine whether bacterial products other than endotoxins may be involved in the cholestasis process, 14c-taurocholate (tc) uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes was measured in the presence of mid-log, stationary and mid-death phase bacterial broth supernatants from eight common bacterial pathogens. the results were then correlated with a quantitative assessment of endotoxin production by each organism. supernatants from haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumonia demonstrated a striking inhibitory effect on bile salt uptake (77.2 +/- 6.7, 46.9 +/- 6.5 and 32.9 +/- 7.1% maximum inhibition of 14c-tc uptake, respectively) when compared to sterile broth controls. streptococcus faecalis (enterococcus), escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides  fragilis products, on the other hand, had relatively minor effects (12.3 +/- 5.2, 12.0 +/- 7.5, 8.4 +/- 6.7 and less than 5.0% inhibition respectively), while those from proteus mirabilis had an intermediate effect (18.5 +/- 8.3% inhibition). bile salt efflux rates (16.0 +/- 2.7 and 25.1 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, mean +/- sem) were similar in bacteria demonstrating marked uptake inhibition (haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa) when compared to those with only minor inhibitory effects (staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis) (14.3 +/- 1.1 and 18.4 +/- 2.6 nmol/min/10(6) hepatocytes, respectively, p greater than 0.05). 14c-tc uptake inhibition did not correlate with the amount of endotoxin produced by each organism (r = 0.251). the results of this study indicate that bacteria produce a factor other than endotoxin that significantly inhibits bile salt uptake by isolated rat hepatocytes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a collaborative study was undertaken to evaluate the performance of currently marketed mueller-hinton agars from seven manufacturers by replicate disk diffusion tests with standard quality control strains. identification of the manufacturers was concealed, and the resulting data were evaluated for the selection of a physical reagent standard against which the performance of future  production lots would be tested and made to conform. a medium was selected which  was sufficiently close to existing national committee for clinical laboratory standards quality control limits that current interpretive criteria would require minimum modification. two of the seven lots were eliminated from further consideration because the final phs were outside acceptable limits. the remaining four lots had 96% of mean zone diameters less than or equal to 2 mm from those of the chosen lot and 65% of the means were less than or equal to 1 mm from those of the chosen lot for all 28 antimicrobial agent-organism combinations. manufacturers then attempted to produce new lots of mueller-hinton agar which performed within the prescribed limits of the chosen lot. one lot performed in close conformity with the selected standard, but the overall performance of the media was essentially the same as that of the randomly chosen lots in the initial study. it was concluded that one of the original seven lots demonstrated properties which made it a tentative candidate for a physical reagent standard and that the use of a physical reagent standard in evaluating production lots might aid in stabilizing the performance of mueller-hinton agar.

TI  == the oral immune system: dynamics of salivary immunoglobulin production in the inbred mouse.
AB  == in the oral cavity, salivary immunoglobulins (igs) are the principal mediators of specific immunity. using carbachol to stimulate saliva flow, we investigated, in  a kinetic study, individual variations in salivary ig concentrations in 23 adult  balb/c mice using an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (elisa). it appeared that  salivary ig concentrations are highly variable in individual mice (iga: 3-81 micrograms/ml; igg: 0-2.9 micrograms/ml; igm: 0.002-0.14 microgram/ml). in individual mice stimulated at different times over a 3 week period there are considerable variations both in salivary ig concentrations and in their respective ratio. broad variations were also found in the levels of specific iga  and igg antibodies to three indigenous oral murine bacteria. present data thus indicate that among genetically identical mice of the same age and sex, sharing identical diet, there is considerable heterogeneity in salivary igs. as this heterogeneity was mimicked at the cellular level in major and minor salivary gland-associated b-cells, it appears that antibody dynamics in the oral cavity could reflect the adaptive capacity of the oral immune system to local antigenic  challenge.

TI  == immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == studies of various models of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. a limited number of studies carried out in models of klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. the efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections  has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. most studies of combined therapy in  gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. experiments in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans, and streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. the enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. with p. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. for both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. these in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.

AB  == vascular access ports (hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. all were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. one hemasite from which staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. another hemasite from which  proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting  of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular  products. this direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the  resolution of the associated infection.

TI  == antibacterial properties of 2-acetylpyridine-1-oxide thiosemicarbazones.
AB  == we have investigated the in vitro antibacterial activity of 13 2-acetylpyridine-1-oxide thiosemicarbazones and 5 thiosemicarbazides against 80 clinically significant bacterial cultures, including 13 isolates with known antibiotic resistance. of the thiosemicarbazones tested, 5 had minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 0.25 microgram/ml for neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates; 1  of these had an mic range of 0.25-0.5 microgram/ml for the neisseria meningitidis cultures, and 2 had mics of 2 and 2-4 micrograms/ml for staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis isolates, respectively. two of the thiosemicarbazides had  mics of 0.25 microgram/ml for n. gonorrhoeae, whereas 2 others had mics of 2-4 and 4-8 micrograms/ml for s. aureus and s. faecalis isolates, respectively. the test compounds were ineffective against the gram-negative enteric cultures and the pseudomonas isolates.

TI  == in vitro studies of plasmid-mediated penicillinase from streptococcus faecalis suggest a staphylococcal origin.
AB  == a strain of streptococcus faecalis with plasmid-mediated penicillinase production was studied further. partially purified penicillinase from the s. faecalis strain hydrolyzed penicillin, ampicillin, and ureido-penicillins but not penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillins, cephalosporins, or imipenem; hydrolysis was inhibited by clavulanic acid. hydrolysis of a given antibiotic correlated with a marked increase in the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of that drug when a high inoculum was used. as with most enterococci, the mics of cephalosporins and penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillins were too high for clinical usefulness, although these agents did not show an inoculum effect. based upon hybridization under stringent conditions of plasmid dna from the s. faecalis strain to cloned penicillinase genes from staphylococcus aureus,  it appears that these resistance determinants are highly homologous and suggests  that this enzyme was introduced into streptococci from staphylococci.

TI  == antibacterial activity of seminalplasmin, a basic protein from bovine seminal plasma.
AB  == seminalplasmin, a 6,000 dalton antimicrobial protein present in bovine seminal plasma, is shown to inhibit growth and/or rna synthesis in several bacterial species. in only one strain out of twenty one belonging to fourteen species, did  both rna synthesis and growth appear to be resistant to seminalplasmin. the antibacterial activity of seminalplasmin, in the case of e. coli, was also studied as a function of its concentration and of time; the minimal concentration of the protein required for 100% bactericidal activity was only about twice that  required for 100% bacteriostatic activity. the killing of e. coli cells proceeded in two phases, a slow phase and then a rapid one, and required several hours for  completion. several bacterial species tested secreted proteases into the medium that destroyed seminalplasmin.

TI  == bacteriological study of renal calculi.
AB  == the pre-operative urine, pelvic urine, removed calculi and calculus washings were examined bacteriologically in 24 patients undergoing removal of intrarenal calculi. four of seven patients with struvite calculi had an infected pre-operative midstream urine specimen and six of the seven removed calculi demonstrated significant bacterial growth. proteus mirabilis was the commonest organism isolated. of 17 patients with oxalate calculi only one had an infected pre-operative urine culture, but in four cases the removed stones were infected.  quantitative bacteriological culture of the stones and their washings demonstrated that infection is within the stone itself. pre-operative urine culture failed to predict infection within the stone in 60% of patients with infected stones. the results suggest that the presence of infected urine together with the presence of renal calculus is indication for removal of the calculus.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of aridicins, novel glycopeptide antibiotics with high and prolonged levels in blood.
AB  == three new glycopeptide antibiotics, aridicins a, b, and c, produced by kibdelosporangium aridum have a spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro which is similar to that of vancomycin. the antimicrobial activities of these glycopeptides against clinical bacterial isolates were compared with those of vancomycin and other related glycopeptide antibiotics in vitro by agar dilution and microtiter broth dilution tests and in vivo in mouse protection studies. in vitro they were somewhat less effective than vancomycin against strains of staphylococcus aureus and less active against coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. however, they were more active than vancomycin against strains of streptococcus faecalis and markedly superior to vancomycin and other glycopeptide antibiotics against strains of clostridium difficile. in experimental infections, aridicin a was effective against strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, and streptococcus pyogenes, although its 50% effective doses were higher than those of vancomycin when administered after infection. after subcutaneous administration, aridicin a had a higher peak level in serum and a longer half-life than vancomycin or teicoplanin. the aridicins were markedly superior to vancomycin when administered prior to infection in mouse protection tests, indicating long-acting potential.

TI  == infection control during parenteral nutrition therapy.
AB  == parenteral nutrition therapy can achieve an anabolic state in patients who are unable to maintain normal nitrogen balance; however, it may be associated with infectious complications. infections may be related to contamination of the cannula and the cannula wound, of the infusate, or of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. a variety of microorganisms has been associated with these infections. the exact mechanisms that initiate cannula-related infection are poorly understood. susceptibility of the host, the method and site of cannula insertion, colonization of parenteral nutrition cannulas, use of parenteral nutrition systems for multiple purposes, cannula material, and other factors may  all play some role. controlling infections depend on many factors, including quality control processes to ensure sterility of parenteral nutrition solutions,  attention to aseptic technique during cannula insertion, procedures to prevent in-use contamination, proper care of the cannula insertion site, and proper management of other parts of the parenteral nutrition system. in addition, infectious complications appear to be reduced by an organized team that follows infection control protocols. many facets of parenteral nutrition therapy are based on data from uncontrolled clinical investigations. well-designed, controlled clinical trials may provide data that will further minimize the risks  associated with parenteral nutrition therapy.

TI  == streptococcal phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system: purification  and characterization of a phosphoprotein phosphatase which hydrolyzes the phosphoryl bond in seryl-phosphorylated histidine-containing protein.
AB  == histidine-containing protein (hpr) of gram-positive bacteria was found to be phosphorylated at a seryl residue (p-ser-hpr) in an atp-dependent reaction catalyzed by a protein kinase (j. deutscher and m. h. saier, jr., proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 80:6790-6794, 1983). here we describe the purification and characterization of a soluble enzyme of streptococcus faecalis which splits the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr. the enzyme has a molecular weight of ca. 7.5 x 10(4), as determined by its migration behavior on a sephacryl s-200 column. on native polyacrylamide gels the purified enzyme produced only one protein band. on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels we found one major protein band of molecular weight 2.9 x 10(4) and two minor protein bands of molecular weights 2.3 x 10(4) and 7 x 10(4). fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which stimulated the atp-dependent, protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of hpr, had no effect on  the phosphatase activity. other glycolytic intermediates also had no effect. however, inorganic phosphate, which inhibited the atp-dependent hpr kinase, stimulated the p-ser-hpr phosphatase. edta at a concentration of 0.1 mm completely inhibited the phosphatase. divalent cations like mg2+, mn2+, and co2+  overcame the inhibition by edta. fe2+, zn2+, and cu2+ had no effect, whereas ca2+ slightly inhibited the phosphatase. atp was also found to inhibit the phosphatase. under conditions in which atp severely inhibited the phosphatase, adp was found to have no effect on the enzyme activity. besides p-ser-hpr of s. faecalis, the phosphatase was also able to hydrolyze the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr of streptococcus lactis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and lactobacillus casei. phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside phosphorylation, catalyzed by the s. aureus phosphoenolpyruvate:lactose phosphotransferase system, was about 150-fold  decreased in the presence of p-ser-hpr of s. aureus, as compared with hpr. however, when p-ser-hpr was first incubated with p-ser-hpr phosphatase to allow complete hydrolysis of the phosphoryl bond, it had the same activity as hpr. besides this cytoplasmic phosphoprotein phosphatase, we detected a membrane-bound phosphatase which also hydrolyzed the phosphoryl bond in p-ser-hpr.

TI  == phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system. 1h nmr studies on chemically modified hpr proteins.
AB  == the low-pk tyrosyl residue present in the heat-stable proteins (hpr) of all gram-positive bacteria studied until now has been labeled by tetranitromethane in the hpr of bacillus subtilis and streptococcus faecalis. the nitrotyrosyl derivatives obtained are fully active in the complementation assay. the labeled tyrosyl residues could be identified as tyr-37 in both proteins. reinvestigation  of the low-pk tyrosyl residue in hpr of staphylococcus aureus resulted in the same assignment. in all three proteins an interaction between nitrotyrosine-37 and the active center his-15 could be observed, leading to an increase in the pk  of his-15 and a change of its chemical shift parameters. the 1h nmr lines of the  complete aromatic spin system of hpr of b. subtilis could be assigned by the nitration studies. labeling of arg-17 in hpr of s. aureus and s. faecalis by 1,2-cyclohexanedione in the presence of borate ions causes an almost complete inhibition of its enzymatic activity. in the nmr spectrum the labeling of the arginyl residue influences the resonance lines of his-15: two new resonance lines for the c-2 protons of equal intensity are observed, a fact that could be explained by two different conformations in slow exchange. the pk value of his-15 was not changed by the labeling, excluding arg-17 as responsible for the low pk of his-15.

AB  == the results of a large three centre co-ordinated study into the in vitro susceptibility of bacterial clinical pathogens showed no significant evidence of  regional variation within the u.k. towards the 10 antibiotics examined. the newer cephalosporins were highly potent and superior to other antibiotics against the enterobacteriaceae, with ceftriaxone and cefotaxime the most potent. against pseudomonas aeruginosa, gentamicin was the most active, followed by ceftazidime,  piperacillin and ceftriaxone; cefotetan was the least active. staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus albus were most susceptible to cefuroxime and gentamicin, though most were also susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and cefoxitin. streptococcus (groups a and b), streptococcus pneumoniae and neisseria spp. were susceptible to most agents other than gentamicin, but ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were overall the most potent. ceftriaxone was the most active agent against haemophilus influenzae. the newer agents were variable and relatively poor against anaerobes and only amoxycillin and piperacillin were significantly active against streptococcus faecalis. the overall resistance level to the third  generation cephalosporins was low.

TI  == deficiency of neutrophil bactericidal activity in term and preterm infants. a longitudinal study.
AB  == the present longitudinal study of 40 healthy term infants and 20 preterm infants  shows that neutrophil bactericidal activity against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis is transiently but significantly impaired in term infants  during the 1st week of life. the deficiency is more severe and prolonged in preterm infants, and may contribute to the neonate's increased susceptibility to  infections.

TI  == the effects of hypothermia on neutrophil function in vitro.
AB  == hypothermia may be associated with compromised host defenses and serious bacterial infections in man. we have examined the effects of moderate hypothermia (29 degrees c) on neutrophil function in vitro. at 29 degrees c, neutrophil phagocytosis of staphylococcus aureus was impaired. in contrast, neutrophil killing of streptococcus faecalis was most affected by hypothermia. phagocytosis, as measured by neutrophil ingestion of opsonized oil-red-o-particles, was reduced at 29 degrees c over the 15 min of observation. neutrophil metabolism linked to bactericidal pathways dependent on oxidative metabolism was reduced at 29 degrees c. hexose monophosphate pathway (hmp) activity in neutrophils early after stimulation with latex particles was reduced. after 2 hr hmp activity was similar at 29 degrees c and 37 degrees c. neotetrazolium dye reduction was reduced early  after latex stimulation of neutrophils and after 30 min it was similar to cells at 37 degrees c. leukocyte migration under agarose to bacterial-derived and formyl-methionyl-phenylalanine chemotactic factors was reduced by 50% and 70%, respectively. migration to serum-derived chemotactic factor was reduced by only 20%. when cells were cooled to 29 degrees c for 30 to 90 min and rewarmed, neutrophil function was normal. these effects of hypothermia on neutrophil function may explain, in part, the increased incidence of serious and frequently  fatal bacterial infections in man.

TI  == effect of hyperbaric oxyhelium gas on response of bacteria to antimicrobial agents in vitro.
AB  == modern diving techniques can require the treatment of infection in an atmosphere  of pressurized oxyhelium gas. the antibiotic susceptibility of 16 species and strains (eight genera) of gram-negative bacilli and 3 species and strains (two genera) of gram-positive cocci to each of 21 antimicrobial agents was assessed in air at atmospheric pressure and in oxyhelium gas at an absolute pressure of 7 bar (ca. 709 kpa). a disk diffusion technique was employed, and significantly different results were obtained in the two atmospheres. the effect of oxyhelium on diameters of growth inhibition varied significantly with the bacterium and with the antibiotic and was particularly marked with certain bacterium-antibiotic combinations. the gram-negative bacilli generally gave reduced zone diameters in  oxyhelium, whereas the gram-positive cocci showed a mixture of effects.

TI  == the effect of cytotoxic therapy on saliva and oral flora.
AB  == oral complications of cytotoxic therapy result from direct mucosal damage and, indirectly, occur as a consequence of immunosuppression. such problems are further exacerbated as a result of associated xerostomia and secondary infection. therefore, the aims of this study were to examine the salivary volume and composition (amylase, iga, and lysozyme) together with the oral carriage of potential pathogens in patients receiving cytotoxic therapy. a pilot study comparing healthy controls with patients on chemotherapy for malignant conditions indicated that there were differences between the two groups. therefore, a longitudinal study was initiated and twelve patients were assessed prior to and 4 and 12 weeks after the start of cytotoxic therapy. the 10-minute forced-spitting  salivary volume and amylase and iga levels all declined significantly over the 12-week period. lysozyme content did not change. a quantitative increase in the oral carriage of candida species, coliforms, and staphylococcus aureus was also observed during therapy. hence, it is concluded that cytotoxic chemotherapy results in a decreased salivary flow, a reduction in salivary amylase and iga, and an increase in the oral carriage of opportunistic pathogens.

AB  == several tests, bacitracin, camp, pyroglutamic acid-b-naphthylamide test (pyr test), bile aesculin hydrolysis, salt tolerance and pigment production tests were evaluated for their reliability and speed in presumptive identification of streptococci. bacitracin correctly identified all of the group a streptococci but 5% of other beta haemolytic streptococci were misidentified as group a. the pyr reaction was just as sensitive but more specific for group a streptococci and the results were available within 2-3 h. the pyr reaction also effectively differentiated between enterococcal and non-enterococcal group d streptococci. both the salt tolerance test and the pyr reaction misidentified bile aesculin positive non-group d streptococci as non-enterococcal group d streptococci. pigment production by group b streptococci was more reliable than the camp test for identifying group b streptococci. the combination of pyr, bile aesculin and pigment production allowed rapid differentiation of several medically important groups of streptococci.

TI  == [bathing caps and germ shedding of human scalp hair].
AB  == with three groups of 30 test subjects each, having short, medium-long and long hair, as well as with a model test using a woman's wig it was possible to show that by wearing bathing caps the transfer of germs from the scalp hairs to the swimming-pool water can be reduced considerably, either by the isolation of the hairs from water when snugly fitting water-tight bathing caps are used, or by a reduction of the germ-carrying hair surface rinsed by the water, which is always  the case, even when using water-permeable caps. the effect is the greater, the larger the natural hair surface is. the rule that persons with long hair of either sex should wear bathing caps proves again justified although the prescriptive use of bathing caps by "the long-haired" earlier was based on other  concepts. the population of germs settling on bathing caps does not in the least  reach the germ counts discharged into the swimming-pool water when no headgear is used. nevertheless, the issue of disposable bathing caps, which is occasionally practised, must be welcomed for reasons of hygiene. the use of bathing caps not only diminishes the discharge of colony forming units (cfu) but also prevents the indicators of pollution, pathological and occasionally pathological germs being washed into the water from the hair. reference is also made to the possibility that a snugly fitting bathing cap protects the swimmer against the risk of contracting otitis.

TI  == role of resistance to starvation in bacterial survival in sewage and lake water.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine the significance of starvation resistance to the ability of a species to survive in sewage and lake water. tests were conducted for periods of up to 14 days. rhizobium meliloti and one fluorescent and one nonfluorescent strain of pseudomonas were resistant to starvation because their population sizes did not fall appreciably in buffer and sterile lake water, and the first two maintained high numbers after being added to sterile sewage. cell densities of these bacterial species dropped slowly in nonsterile sewage, and more cells of these three organisms than of the other test organisms remained in nonsterile lake water. rhizobium leguminosarum was moderately resistant to starvation because its numbers fell slowly in buffer and sterile lake water and did not change appreciably in sterile sewage. the abundance of micrococcus flavus added to buffer and sterile lake water did not change, but the density of m. flavus declined in nonsterile lake water. the abundance of r. leguminosarum fell  in nonsterile lake water and nonsterile sewage. streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, an asporogenous strain of bacillus subtilis, and streptococcus sp. were susceptible to starvation because their populations were markedly reduced in buffer. populations of the last three species declined rapidly in nonsterile and sterile samples of lake water and sewage. s. faecalis declined rapidly when added to nonsterile lake water and sewage and sterile lake  water but not when added to sterile sewage, the persistence in the last instance  probably being associated with the availability of organic nutrients.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == cefamandole therapy in hand infections.
AB  == hand lacerations, especially when inadequately treated, may result in infections  caused by aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. anaerobic infections most commonly result from human bite injuries in which there is contact between hand and mouth. the search continues for an ideal antibiotic to employ when anaerobic organisms are suspected. in this study cefamandole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was employed whenever anaerobic hand infections were suspected following trauma. in each patient quantitative cultures for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms were  obtained. all organisms isolated were tested by standard susceptibility assays for both aerobes and anaerobes. in the case of anaerobes, minimum inhibitory concentration assays were also performed. after the initial culture was obtained, each patient received approximately 1.5 gm of cefamandole every 6 hours for a period of 5 days. this therapy was changed only if susceptibility studies indicated resistance to cefamandole. in our patients, 58% of the infectious organisms were aerobic and facultative anaerobic and 42% were obligate anaerobes. the predominant organisms isolated were staphylococcus aureus and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which accounted for 42% of the infections. in most of the aerobic infections a single organism was isolated, whereas multiple organisms were identified in the anaerobic infections. all but one of the infections responded to cefamandole; the one that didn't was caused by enterobacter cloacae and required treatment with an aminoglycoside. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, which includes both aerobes and anaerobes, cefamandole is useful in treating infections, especially those resulting from human bites.

AB  == a novel approach for setting interpretive breakpoints in disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing according to determined minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) limits is described, using the method of single-strain regression analysis. the procedure was tested on reference strains staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), streptococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), escherichia coli (atcc  25922), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc 27853), using published results from cefoperazone disk diffusion experiments. the correlation between logarithm of the disk content and inhibition zone diameter squared was linear, excluding three endpoint values. when constants a and b in the new regression line equation were  calculated for the four strains, all four showed different regression lines. zone diameters corresponding to various mics were calculated for a disk content of 75  micrograms. the values obtained for the four strains were 20.1, 20.9, 24.9, and 25.8 mm, respectively, for an mic of 16 micrograms/ml, and 15.7, 15.7, 22.3, and  17.9 mm, respectively, for an mic of 64 micrograms/ml. the following zone diameter breakpoints were determined for the "i" (intermediate) category, using a 75-micrograms disk: s. aureus, 18 to 15 mm; s. faecalis, 23 to 13 mm; e. coli, 20 to 17 mm; and p. aeruginosa, 20 to 17 mm.

TI  == enhancement by candida albicans of staphylococcus aureus, serratia marcescens, and streptococcus faecalis in the establishment of infection in mice.
AB  == candida albicans has been shown to stimulate infection in mice by a number of bacteria. mice inoculated intraperitoneally with as little as 500 colony-forming  units of staphylococcus aureus along with a nonlethal dose of 10(8) colony-forming units of c. albicans (one-third the dose causing 50% mortality in  7 days) developed widespread staphylococcal infection. s. aureus injected alone at that or considerably higher doses did not establish infection. phage typing methods demonstrated that the staphylococcal infection was due to the bacterial organisms originally injected. a minimum dose of c. albicans between 1.1 x 10(5)  and 1.1 x 10(7) colony-forming units was necessary for the amplification of virulence of s. aureus to take place. serratia marcescens and streptococcus faecalis inoculated intraperitoneally at small nonlethal doses could also be recovered from blood and tissues 5 days after animals were dually injected with c. albicans but not from animals which were inoculated with the same amounts of these bacteria alone.

TI  == analysis of a single reference strain for determination of gentamicin regression  line constants and inhibition zone diameter breakpoints in quality control of disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing.
AB  == an equation was derived from known formulas to express the size of the inhibition zone diameter in the disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility test as a function  of the disk content of antibiotic. the equation permitted a calculation of regression line constants for the correlation between zone diameter and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) with a single reference strain. analysis of reference strains staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, as well as 12 clinical isolates belonging to these species, showed a linearity between zone size squared and the  logarithm of disk content in tests with 10-, 30-, and 100-micrograms gentamicin disks. all three species, however, gave regression line constants which were characteristic for the individual bacterial species. calculations of zone diameter breakpoints corresponding to recommended mic limits with e. coli and p.  aeruginosa reference strains gave an accurate prediction of gentamicin susceptibility. histogram analysis of 48 strains of streptococcus faecalis from clinical specimens showed a distribution of zone diameter values which would result in false classification of susceptibility with breakpoints calculated for  the other bacterial species studied. single reference strain analysis of s. faecalis atcc 29212 (gentamicin mic, 8 micrograms/ml) permitted the calculation of breakpoints which accurately assigned the strains tested to the intermediate category of susceptibility. single reference strain analysis offers a quality control method for individual laboratories that allows the determination of inhibition zone diameter breakpoints corresponding to recommended mic limits with no mic determinations required.

AB  == the growth-inhibiting behaviour of abacterial, liquid pure cultures made up of three water algae (hydrodictyon reticulatum, chlorella vulgaris, aphanothece nidulans) which were made to grow profusely in special culture containers under constant exposure to light and ventilation was examined in ten different species  of microorganisms during a period of contact of 4 days both in the light and in the dark. subjected to the test were the 5 pathogenic species staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and  candida albicans as well the 5 bacterial contamination indicators e. coli (faecal indicator), streptococcus faecalis (enterococci), enterobacter aerogenes ("coliforms"), staphylococcus epidermidis (dermic germ) and bacillus subtilis ("contamination germ"). it was found that --hydrodictyon reticulatum and aphanothece nidulans exert a strong antibacterial effect, while chlorella vulgaris provides no indication of a bacterial growth-inhibiting effect. --this antibiosis is linked with the assimilative activity of the algal cultures, as in  the dark no antibacterial action is discernible --the "antibiotic principle" must be liable to transitory or rapid disintegration because the algal cultures are ineffective in the dark and also culture filtrates of 5-days old algal cultures exercise no growth-inhibiting effect. with respect to the sanitation of waters it is important to state that a profuse growth of algae produces a certain, but hardly reliable "biological water disinfection" and renders difficult the assessment of the quality of a water-course as a result of the elimination of the usual contamination indicators. therefore, additional microbiological quality parameters must be used for assessment of pollution of swimming pools with strong algal growth.

AB  == pyelonephritis was studied after an intravenous injection of candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, or enterococcus in alloxan-diabetic rats and in water-diuresing or non-diuresing nondiabetic rats. the renal microbial populations of c. albicans or s. aureus were found to be greater than 10(5) colony-forming units per g for up to 42 days in diabetic rats, whereas the kidneys tended to become sterile in nondiabetic rats. no significant difference was found in the course of enterococcal pyelonephritis in diabetic versus control rats. the difference in the 50% infective dose for each microorganism between diabetic and control rats was less than or equal to log10. neither duration of diabetes nor weight loss contributed to the greater and more sustained renal populations of c. albicans and s. aureus in diabetic rats. the inflammatory reaction in kidneys infected with s. aureus or c. albicans was greater in diabetic rats. fungus balls associated with ureteral obstruction and gross multiple renal abscesses occurred in diabetic, but not in nondiabetic, rats infected with candida. growth of c. albicans and s. aureus in vitro in urine from diabetic rats was significantly greater than it was in urine from control rats. addition of water or glucose to the urine of non-diuresing, nondiabetic rats significantly increased in vitro growth of s. aureus and c. albicans. these studies demonstrate greater severity of infection in the diabetic kidney due to s. aureus and c. albicans, which can be partially explained by decreased inhibitory activity of urine for these organisms in diabetic rats.

AB  == aerobic bacterial isolates obtained from endocervical, vaginal and urethral swabbings were tested for interference of neisseria gonorrhoeae growth on solid medium. simultaneous antagonism was studied using the lawn spotting method, and delayed antagonism by the basal spot/lawn method. from 58 swabbings we recuperated a total of 181 isolates, 71 of those were found interfering with at least one out of four gonococcal strains (g-1, g-2, g-3 and g-4). similar percentages of interfering isolates were obtained from each of the isolation sites. the identification of the interfering isolates has revealed that similar numbers of coagulase negative staphylococci and identical numbers of group d streptococci were found for each of those sites. the majority of the interfering  isolates and also of the inhibitory coagulase negative staphylococci showed only  simultaneous antagonism. to complete the interference spectrum, we have tested all the active urogenital isolates against four other gonococcal strains (g-7, g-9, g-10 and g-11). this spectrum showed clearly that interference is not an all or none phenomenon. while the gonococcal interference spectrum of most of the gram positive cocci and the acinetobacter sp. strains is broad, that of all the other isolates is relatively narrow. gonococcal strains g-7 and g-9 were the most susceptible to inhibition by the interfering urogenital isolates while strain g-3 was the most resistant one.

TI  == binding of beta-lactam antibiotics to penicillin-binding proteins of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis: relation to antibacterial activity.
AB  == the binding of 14 structurally diverse beta-lactam antibiotics to penicillin-binding proteins of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis was studied, and the results were examined in the context of the antibacterial activity of the compounds. penicillin-binding proteins 1 (molecular weight, 87,000) and 3 (molecular weight, 75,000) of s. aureus and penicillin-binding proteins 1 (molecular weight, 105,000) and 3 (molecular weight, 79,000) of s. faecalis bound beta-lactam antibiotics at concentrations comparable to minimum inhibitory concentrations and might therefore be essential. the low affinity of s. faecalis penicillin-binding proteins, relative to that of s. aureus penicillin-binding proteins, toward most beta-lactam antibiotics is probably responsible for the resistance of the former organism to most of these compounds.

TI  == rapid diagnosis of infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria by means of an enzyme radioisotopic assay.
AB  == we developed a sensitive enzyme radioisotopic assay for the measurement of beta-lactamase, an enzyme produced by a number of pathogenic bacteria. this eria  was 100-fold more sensitive than the commonly used iodometric or spectrophotometric assays for the measurement of beta-lactamase and, unlike these other assays, the eria was not significantly influenced by serum proteins or unlabeled penicillin. clinical specimens consisting of blood, peritoneal, pleural, and cerebrospinal fluids from patients infected with beta-lactamase-producing organisms yielded positive eria tests; fluids from uninfected patients were negative. the eria takes approximately 90 minutes to perform, and offers great potential for the rapid diagnosis of serious bacterial  infections caused by bacteria which produce beta-lactamase.

TI  == bacterial effect of hydrogen peroxide on urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags is a frequent source of bladder  bacteriuria in patients with indwelling catheters. previous work demonstrated that the addition of 30 ml of 3% h2o2 prevented bacterial contamination of urinary drainage bags for up to 8 h in patients with urinary infections (greater  than 10(5) colony-forming units per ml). survival curves of a variety of organisms in filter-sterilized urine with various concentrations of h2o2 (0.6 to  0.01%) were constructed. organisms with high cellular catalase activity (staphylococcus aureus, serratia marcescens, and proteus mirabilis) required 30 to 60 min of exposure to 0.6% h2o2 for a reduction of 10(8) to less than 1 colony-forming unit per ml, whereas escherichia coli, streptococcus sp., and pseudomonas sp. required only 15 min of exposure. the efficacy of h2o2 in urine was maintained despite exposure to room temperature for 5 days and reinoculation  with bacterial suspensions. h2o2 is inexpensive and relatively nontoxic, and these data suggest that periodic instillation of h2o2 into urinary drainage bags  may eliminate a source of bladder bacteriuria and environmental contamination.

TI  == antibacterial properties of dilute formocresol and eugenol and propylene glycol.
AB  == formocresol and eugenol are the two nonspecific intracanal medicaments commonly used in endodontic practice. both have high tissue irritation potential when used in conventional strength. propylene glycol is an alcohol that is injectable and itself possesses significant antibacterial action. it is a popular vehicle and hence was used to modify the two drugs. standard bacteriologic methods were employed to test the antibacterial action of these lower concentrations of the two drugs against four test organisms. the investigations indicate that formocresol at as low as 10 to 20% and eugenol at 75% are bactericidal in action  and hence may be useful at these concentrations for clinical use. evaluation of these lower concentrations is warranted for possible clinical use. propylene glycol, which possesses antibacterial action and is remarkably innocuous to tissues, appears to be a suitable vehicle for dilution of formocresol and eugenol.

AB  == normal sera and plasma, derived from humans, calves, rats, rabbits, horses, human synovial fluids, inflammatory exudates, and leukocyte extracts, when sufficiently diluted are highly bacteriolytic for staph, aureus, strep. faecalis, b. sutilis and to a variety of gram-negative rods. on the other hand, concentrated serum or  the other body fluids are usually not bacteriolytic for these bacterial species.  while the lysis of staph, aureus and b. subtilis by diluted serum is not lysozyme dependent, lysis of strep. faecalis is absolutely dependent on the concentration  of lysozyme. the lytic factor in human serum is present in cohn's fractions iii,  iv, and v. it is nondialyzable, resistant to heating for 75 degrees c and 20 min, and acts optimally at ph 5.0. like leukocyte extracts, synovial fluids, and inflammatory exudates, it lyses only young staphylococci. the inability of concentrated serum to lyse staph. aureus and strep. faecalis is due to the presence in the gamma globulin fraction of a potent inhibitor, which can be partly removed by dilution of by adsorption upon the homologous bacteria. lysis of the bacteria is also strongly inhibited by cohn's fraction ii (gamma globulin) by high-molecular-weight dna, heparin, liquoid, and histone. the possible role played by serum globulin in the protection of bacteria against degradation by leukocyte is discussed.

AB  == strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus bovis, and a strain of streptococcus that produces filaments were grown on agar containing penicillin at concentrations of one-half to 1/10th the minimal inhibitory concentration. these penicillin-exposed organisms as well as untreated control organisms were incubated with human serum of plasma. both serum and plasma produced a remarkable bactericidal effect on the filament-forming streptococcus grown in the presence of penicillin, whereas the untreated control  was only slightly affected. this response resembled that of gram-negative bacilli rather than that of gram-positive cocci. the growth of staphylococci exposed to penicillin was slightly inhibited in the presence of serum, whereas the growth of untreated staphylococci was stimulated. the streptococci, regardless of whether they were treated with penicillin or whether they were untreated, showed no change in growth pattern in the presence of serum.

TI  == [the antibacterial activity of diphenhydramine (author's transl)].
AB  == diphenhydramine (n,n-dimethyl-2-diphenyl-methoxy-ethylamine) [n,n-dimethyl-2-(diphenylmethoxy)-ethylamin] (dph) is a well-known local anaesthetic and an antagonist of both acetylcholine and histamine. we tested its  antibacterial efficacy by means of three different investigation methods, i.e. microcalorimetry, continuous density measurement and the microdilution test to find out the mic of this compound against various bacteria. dph inhibits the growth of e. coli and klebsiella strains at a concentration of 0.18% of staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus at 0.37%, of pseudomonas aeruginosa at 0.75% and streptococcus faecalis strains at 1.5%. the results of microcalorimetry and continous density measurements showed that the addition of 0.2% dph to a broth with growing bacteria interferes very quickly with cell metabolism and stops further reproduction. the microcalorimetric findings were carried out with staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus strain no. 13,665 an- the e. coli strain no. 3579.

TI  == treatment of bacterial endocarditis with vancomycin.
AB  == five patients with bacterial endocarditis who were allergic to penicillin were treated successfully with vancomycin. the causative microorganisms were streptococcus bovis, s faecalis, s agalactiae, s intermedius, and staphylococcus  aureus. except for the strain of s faecalis, vancomycin was bactericidal against  these organisms at easily achievable serum concentrations. to insure a bactericidal serum titer of 1:8 or greater, streptomycin was added in the therapy of the case caused by s faecalis. there was no toxicity from vancomycin therapy in our patients except for mild phlebitis at the infusion site. vancomycin appears to be an effective alternative to penicillin in individuals with endocarditis due to susceptible organisms. vancomycin in combination with an aminoglycoside may be appropriate therapy for enterococcal endocarditis.

AB  == helium at pressures of 20 to 70 atm in the presence of air found to stimulate growth of streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus, mainly by increasing the rate of exponential growth. however, at these same pressures, helium potentiated the growth-inhibitory actions of oxygen and nitrous oxide (n2o). oxygen was found to act essentially as an anesthetic gas in inhibiting growth of s. faecalis; its potency was approximately the same as that  of n2o, and it acted additively in combination with n2o to inhibit the streptococcus. oxygen proved to be more potent than n2o in inhibiting the growth  of e. coli and s. aureus, and each gas potentiated the action of the other. oxygen sensitivity was correlated with n2o sensitivity. overall, our findings indicate that bacterial growth inhibition by anesthetic gases does not accurately reflect narcotic action.

AB  == the preceding test results appear to favour the impression method used for the testing of surface disinfection procedures. further investigations were concerned with the selection of a suitable germ carrier. the high recovery rate of the bacteria and the invariably uniform quality of the germ carrier are the decisive  criteria. since a dependence on the type of germ was also to be expected, we checked staph. aureus, str. faecalis, e. coli, kl. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa for their behaviour on pvc, varnished wooden surfaces, v 2a, rough and smooth glass, resopal, ceramic tiles with dull and glazing finish as well as on plywood. the germ carriers were contaminated quantitatively, dried, sprayed with distilled water to stimulate disinfection and examined after they were allowed to react for a period of 6 hours. a set of 10 germ carriers was examined simultaneously with 10 rodac impressions. the data were checked by variance analytical methods and evaluated on the mean (or median) values. it was found that while the initial germ number was kept equal op tiles and v 2a steel produced the highest germ yield. plywood proved largely unsuitable. among the test germs, e. coli and kl. pneumoniae had the lowest adhesion; it was inferior to that of staphylococci and  pseudomonads. however, for these 4 germ types 3 impressions per germ carrier suffice for a reliable assessment based on computations. the yield amounts to more than 90 per cent. 94 per cent of the streptococci were also recovered with 3 impressions, but the absolute germ quantity was low. the use of this type of germ can be recommended only with reservation.

AB  == hot saline extracts of streptococcus mutans have been shown to contain antigenic  substances which occasionally react nonspecifically with some antisera against whole cells of various serological groups and types of streptococci. chromatography of the extract of s. mutans strain mt703 (serotype e) on a diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 column gave two principal antigens. one antigen was eluted without adsorption to the resin and was identified as the serotype-specific polysaccharide. the other antigen, which contained a large quantity of phosphorus, was absorbed to and released from the resin by gradient elution. it was reactive against the antisera specific for polyglycerophosphate (pgp) from group a streptococcus pyogenes and/or s. mutans strain ingbritt (type  c). the pgp antigen was further purified by gel filtration with sephadex g-75. two peaks, pgp-1, and pgp-2, were obtained. each possessed the same antigenic specificity to anti-pgp serum as shown by immunodiffusion. chemical analyses revealed that the molar ratio of phosphorus to glycerol in both was about 1:1, although the protein content between the two was significantly different. pgp antigen was found to be widely distributed in hot saline extracts from various gram-positive bacteria, with a few exceptions. however, all gram-negative bacteria examined were free of pgp. the pgp in the hot saline extracts of various gram-positive bacteria possessed an essentially identical antigenic specificity.  the addition of diethylaminoethyl-sephadex a-25 resin to hot saline extracts successfully removed the cross-reacting pgp antigen. after adsorption of the extract from s. mutans, the supernatant contained only type-specific polysaccharide antigen, except type b, in which both type b-specific polysaccharide and pgp antigens were absorbed with the resin. this simple procedure should be useful for the removal of the pgp-type teichoic acid from antigen extracts of bacteria that contain uncharged polysaccharides.

AB  == we studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing  with other antibiotics. beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci  are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. staph, aureus and staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin,  and no resistant strain to this drug was found. haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and h. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. escherichia coli, klebsiella, citrobacter, serratia and five species of proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. a few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in e. coli, citrobacerr, serratia, pr. morganii and pr. rettgeri. pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of proteus. antibacterial activity of gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. gentamicin-resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.

AB  == a michael type addition of an amine to 6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-2h-pyran-3(6h)-one (1) dissolved in ether, benzene, or thf gave 5-amino derivatives of 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-2h-pyran-3(4h)-one (2). these by subsequent reduction with lialh4 were converted to 5-amino derivatives of 6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)tetrahydro-2h-pyran-3-ol (3). both isomers a  and b of 1 (in regard to the methoxy group at c6) were used for the synthesis of  2 and 3. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the amine adducts 2 was of the same order of magnitude as the starting material. amine adducts in general, however, were by far more active as coccidiostats than the starting material and  retained their activities when they were reduced. 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-5-(dimethylamino)-2h-pyran-3(4h) -one hydrochloride (a) and 5,6-dihydro-6-methoxy-2-methyl-2-(4'-biphenylyl)-5-(dimethylamino)-2h-pyran-3(4h) -one hydrochloride (b), prepared from isomer a and b of 1, respectively, were the most active as coccidiostats. these compounds when administered orally to chickens 1 day prior to infection at a concentration 0.05% in their diet gave them total protection against eimeria tenella.

TI  == [disinfection of sewage waters from rendering plants by means by peracetic acid].
AB  == in our experiments, peracetic acid -- known in commerce as "wolfasteril" was tested as a new and efficient disinfectant to disinfect sewage waters from rendering plants. peracetic acid was used in experiments in concentration of 0.1  to 1.0% for 30 sec. to 60 min. as a comparative agent, 5% chloramine was used. results obtained in preliminary and main experiments proved that peracetic acid is fully appropriate to disinfect biologically cleaned sewage waters in rendering plants. sewage waters supplying the main stream has to pass mostly a short section after having left the water clariflier. consequently, the concentration of 1% peracetic acid acting for 30 sec. is the optimum one. the recommendation of this application norm for peracetic acid in water clarifiers from rendering plants being at least suitable in controlling disasters.

AB  == the abilities of 14 strains of aerobic gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli to adhere in vitro to human or canine aortic valve leaflets were compared. 2-mm sections of excised valve leaflets were obtained by punch biopsy and were incubated under standardized conditions in suspensions of bacteria. valve sections were subsequently washed and homogenized, and quantitative techniques were used to determine the proportions of bacteria from the initial suspensions that had adhered to the valve sections. comparable results were obtained when these adherence ratios were determined by two independent methods based either on measurements of bacterial viability or of radioactivity in 51cr-labeled bacteria. for each bacterial strain, the adherence ratio was constant over a wide range of concentrations of bacteria in the incubation medium. strains of enterococci, viridans streptococci, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and pseudomonas aeruginosa (adherence ratios 0.003-0.017) were found to adhere more readily to valve sections than strains of  escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae (adherence ratios 0.00002-0.00004). the organisms that most frequently cause bacterial endocarditis were found to adhere best to heart valves in vitro, suggesting that the ability to adhere to valvular endothelium may be an important or essential charcteristic of bacteria that cause endocarditis in man.

TI  == effect of valinomycin on ion transport in bacterial cells and on bacterial growth.
AB  == the antimicrobial action of valinomycin relative to the k+ and na+ contents of the medium has been investigated in several species of bacteria, particularly in  streptococcus faecalis, which effects energy-linked transport exclusively via degradation of glycolytic atp, micrococcus lysodeikticus, effecting active ion transport by respiration and staphylococcus aureus, the energy-dependent ion transport of which is due to both glycolytic atp degradation and respiration. it  was demonstrated that valinomycin does not act on k+ transport in the glycolysing cells in the same manner as it does on respiring cells under similar conditions.  addition of valinomycin to respiring cells leads to an increase in k+ influx against the concentrational gradient in both growing and resting cells. in contrast to this, antibiotic-treated glycolysing cells experience passive k+ outflow down the concentrational gradient. it was thus concluded that the electrical potential cannot be the driving force for the energy-linked k+ transport in glycolysing cells.

TI  == phagocytosis in patients and carriers of chronic granulomatous disease.
AB  == the phagocytic capacity of leucocytes from four patients and two carriers of chronic granulomatous disease (c.g.d.) was compared to that of normal leucocytes. leucocytes from c.g.d. patients phagocytised more staphylococcus aureus than did  normal leucocytes after 5, 10, and 20 minutes of incubation. phagocytosis by leucocytes from two carriers of c.g.d. was intermediate between that in the patients and in controls. in contrast, phagocytosis of streptococcus faecalis, an organism readily killed by c.g.d. leucocytes, was similar for control and c.g.d.  leucocytes. enhanced phagocytosis may represent an attempt by leucocytes to compensate for a bactericidal abnormality. in addition, these observations may partly explain why carriers of c.g.d. are not more susceptible to infection despite abnormal leucocyte function. detection of carriers using the described assay of phagocytosis appears relatively simple compared to previously described  methods.

TI  == immersion refractometry of isolated bacterial cell walls.
AB  == immersion-refractometric and light-scattering measurements were adapted to determinations of average refractive indices and physical compactness of isolated bacterial cell walls. the structures were immersed in solutions containing various concentrations of polymer molecules that cannot penetrate into wall pores, and then an estimate was made of the polymer concentration or the refractive index of the polymer solution in which light scattering was reduced to zero. because each wall preparation was heterogeneous, the refractive index of the medium for zero light scattering had to be estimated by extrapolation. refractive indices for walls suspended in bovine serum albumin solutions ranged from 1.348 for walls of the rod form of arthrobacter crystallopoietes to 1.382 for walls of the teichoic acid deficient, 52a5 strain of staphylococcus aureus. these indices were used to calculate approximate values for solids content per milliliter, and the calculated values agreed closely with those estimated from a  knowledge of dextran-impermeable volumes per gram, dry weight, of the walls. when large molecules such as dextrans or serum albumin were used for immersion refractometry, the refractive indices obtained were for entire walls, including both wall polymers and wall water. when smaller molecules that can penetrate wall pores to various extents were used with micrococcus lysodeikticus walls, the average, apparent refractive index of the structures increased as the molecular size of probing molecules was decreased. it was possible to obtain an estimate of 1.45 to 1.46 for the refractive index of wall polymers, predominantly peptidoglycans in this case, by extrapolating the curve for refractive index versus molecular radius to a value of 0.2 nm, the approximate radius of a water molecule. this relatively low value for polymer refractive index was interpreted  as evidence in favor of the amorphous, elastic model of peptidoglycan structure and against the crystalline, rigid model.

TI  == occurrence of glucosamine residues with free amino groups in cell wall peptidoglycan from bacilli as a factor responsible for resistance to lysozyme.
AB  == analysis by dinitrophenylation techniques revealed the occurrence of significant  amounts of glucosamine residues with free amino groups in the peptidoglycan component of cell walls isolated from bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium. a close correlation was demonstrated between the content of  n-unacetylated glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan component and the resistance of the cell walls to lysozyme. these lysozyme-resistant cell walls and peptidoglycan were converted into a lysozyme-sensitive form by means of n-acetylation with acetic anhydride. thus, the occurrence of the n-unacetylated glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan component accounts for the resistance of these cell walls to lysozyme. the n-unacetylated glucosamine residues were not found in a significant amount in the cell walls of micrococcus lysodeikticus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus arabinosus.

AB  == cellulose-acetate and agar gel immunoelectrophoresis were used to study the serum protein patterns of germfree rats before and after monoassociation with a pure culture of staphylococcus aureus (phage type 80/81), streptococcus faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacteroides fragilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or proteus vulgaris. all six bacteria quickly established themselves in the gastrointestinal tract of the germfree rat, and all six increased the animals' total serum proteins. only s. aureus and p. aeruginosa caused a noticeable rise in gamma globulins. l. acidophilus, s. faecalis, and b. fragilis multiplied readily in the gastrointestinal tract but caused only minimal alterations in the  serum proteins. p. vulgaris caused a marked increase in the alpha and beta, but not the gamma globulins.

TI  == evaluation and standardization of an agglutination test for human listeriosis.
AB  == human sera from patients with culturally confirmed listeriosis were tested for immunoglobulin m (igm) and immunoglobulin g (igg) agglutinating antibodies with trypsinized antigens of listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus. the response of humans to listeria infections is mainly igm rather than igg as found in animals. the antigens prepared from l. monocytogenes serotypes 1a, 1b, 2, 4b, and 4d were evaluated for specificity with normal sera, sera from patients with various other diseases, and sera from patients with listeriosis. the trypsinized antigens appeared to be specific for listeria antibodies with a cross-reaction rate of from 5.4 to 6%. cross-reaction  with s. aureus can be eliminated by absorption of the serum with s. aureus. this  agglutination technique appears to be applicable for diagnostic testing, but, as  with all serological procedures, both acute and convalescent sera should be tested.

TI  == amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  == amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. strains of haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, shigella sonnei, salmonella species, and streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. penicillinase-producing strains of staphylococcus aureus and strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive proteus, klebsiella, and enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. the new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. after oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. the absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration  of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

TI  == complete deficiency of leukocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with defective bactericidal activity.
AB  == a 52 yr old caucasian female (f. e.) had hemolytic anemia, a leukemoid reaction,  and fatal sepsis due to escherichia coli. her leukocytes ingested bacteria normally but did not kill catalase positive staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and serratia marcescens. an h(2)o(2)-producing bacterium, streptococcus faecalis, was killed normally. granule myeloperoxidase, acid and alkaline phosphatase, and beta glucuronidase activities were normal, and these enzymes shifted normally to the phagocyte vacuole (light and electron microscopy). intravacuolar reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium did not occur. moreover, only minimal quantities of h(2)o(2) were generated, and the hexose monophosphate shunt (hmps) was not stimulated during phagocytosis. these observations suggested the diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease. however, in contrast to control and chronic granulomatous disease leukocytes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was completely absent in f. e. leukocytes whereas nadh oxidase and nadph oxidase activities were both normal. unlike chronic granulomatous disease, methylene blue did not stimulate the hexose monophosphate shunt in f. e. cells. thus, f. e. and chronic granulomatous disease leukocytes appear to share certain  metabolic and bactericidal defects, but the metabolic basis of the abnormality differs. chronic granulomatous disease cells lack oxidase activity which produces h(2)o(2); f. e. cells had normal levels of oxidase activity but failed to produce nadph due to complete glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. these data indicate that a complete absence of leukocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with defective hexose monophosphate shunt activity is associated with low h(2)o(2) production and inadequate bactericidal activity, and further suggest an  important role for nadph in the production of h(2)o(2) in human granulocytes.

TI  == media exchange method for demonstrating killing of l-phase variants in solid media by normal human serum.
AB  == normal human serum has been shown to kill l-phase variants in a fluid system by the action of antibody plus complement. previous studies, however, failed to demonstrate such killing in solid media. this failure probably resulted from inhibition of complement by medium components such as agar and nacl. a method was developed which circumvents the problems of the anticomplementary properties of agar media and the requirement of some l-phase variants for concentrations of salt that inhibit complement. using this method, we have demonstrated in solid media the killing by normal human serum of the l-phase variants of staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus pyogenes, s. faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhi. this method provides a relatively simple and graphic means for studying host humoral factors lethal for l-phase variants.

TI  == injury of bacteria by sanitizers.
AB  == injury of test cultures was quantitated by differences in colony counts obtained  with a complete medium and those obtained on conventional selective media. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, and several strains of escherichia coli were injured when exposed to the quaternary ammonium compound methylalkyltrimethyl ammonium chloride. representative hypochlorite sanitizers also caused injury of e. coli ml30. sanitizer concentration appeared to be the main factor in the cause of death and injury, a higher concentration being needed to cause death. increases in temperature did not result in substantial increases  in injury; however, the lethal effect was greater at higher temperatures. varying the cell concentration from 10(7) to 10(9) cells per ml did not change the fraction of cell population killed or injured. the inability or failure of common selective media to detect injured bacteria in food could have serious public health consequences.

TI  == in-vitro comparison of erythromycin, lincomycin, and clindamycin.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activities of erythromycin, lincomycin, and clindamycin, a new derivative of lincomycin, were compared. clindamycin was always more active than lincomycin, and was either as active as erythromycin or more so against betahaemolytic streptococci, streptococcus viridans, str. pneumoniae, and erythromycin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus. it was also fully active against most erythromycin-resistant strains of staph. aureus. on the other hand, it was somewhat less active than erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae and considerably less active than erythromycin against str. faecalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae.clinical trials seem to be justified in infections with sensitive organisms for which erythromycin might have been indicated.

TI  == cores, microbial organelles possibly specific to group d streptococci.
AB  == a long, thin, approximately cylindrical core spans the interior of cells of 24-hr cultures of all group d streptococci that were examined, five strains of streptococcus faecalis, single strains of s. faecalis subsp. zymogenes and s. durans, and three strains of streptococcus spp. in one strain of s. faecalis, serial section electron microscopy showed that most cells possess a core. the core is 0.10 to 0.16 mum thick and consists of a matrix and an axial array of ribosomelike particles. it resembles one of two types of cores present in a stable protoplast form of one of the s. faecalis strains. cores were not present  in single strains of s. pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group a), s. agalactiae (group b), s. dysgalactiae (group c), s. equisimilis (group c), and s. mitis (viridans group) that were examined; nor were cores observed in single strains of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and bacillus megaterium. cores may be useful, therefore, in identification of group d streptococci. for preservation and rapid recognition of cores, a glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide sequence of fixation appears superior to the osmium tetroxide method often employed in processing bacteria for electron microscopy.

TI  == enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (ph 6.0 to 8.2). this effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. the urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting e. coli and k. pneumoniae even when diluted  up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same ph as the urine. undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable  of inhibiting these organisms. the range of ph (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.

TI  == effect of different media on in vitro studies of antibiotic combinations.
AB  == in an effort to determine the adequacy of a standard broth medium in the evaluation of antibiotic combinations, 20 strains of various bacterial species were studied simultaneously in mueller-hinton broth and in freshly drawn human serum from apparently healthy volunteers. studies of growth dynamics by use of the usual plate dilution technique for quantitating colony-forming units were performed with strains of staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible), streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, aerobacter, klebsiella, and proteus mirabilis. a variety of different antibiotics were investigated. with 19 of the 20 strains, interpretations of synergism or antagonism were the same in both media. therefore, despite minor variations when  the same strain was studied in both serum and broth, it is concluded that mueller-hinton broth is an adequate medium for use in studies of chemotherapeutic combinations in vitro. a simplified method for studying bactericidal activity is  described, which is deemed practical for clinical microbiology laboratories and which led to the same conclusions regarding the combinations as were obtained by  the more arduous plate dilution test.

TI  == in vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  == norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. the organisms tested included staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus conglomeratus, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhosa, shigella flexnerii, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus vulgaris. bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on s. aureus. however, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. in vivo studies indicated that  female, adult new zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with s.  aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. the protective  effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. when the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. during the 1st day after infection with s. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.

TI  == effect of lactic acid bacteria on growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cultures of lactic acid bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on the growth of staphylococcus aureus in trypticase soy broth (bbl). some of the effectors, e.g., streptococcus faecalis, s. faecium, lactobacillus lactis, l. brevis, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, stimulated growth of s. aureus during early hours of growth, especially at higher temperatures of incubation, but most  cultures were inhibitory, and some (s. faecium and l. mesenteroides) were even killing by the time of attainment of the maximal phase of growth of the staphylococcus. low-temperature meat lactobacilli and leuconostoc dextranicum inhibited s. aureus at 10, 15, 20, and 25 c throughout its growth. streptococcus  faecalis var. liquefaciens inhibited at these temperatures and at 30 and 37 c, as well. when the ratio of effectors to staphylococci in the inoculum was 100:1, the three enterococci, the meat lactobacillus, and l. dextranicum prevented the attainment of 5 x 10(6) staphylococci per milliliter at 15 c, and all but the meat lactobacillus did so at 22 c. a ratio of 1:1 accomplished similar results at 15 c, except that s. aureus was only delayed for 12 hr by s. faecalis. a ratio of 1:100 usually was ineffective. in general, the more effector bacteria there were  in the inoculum, the greater was the overall inhibition (or stimulation) of s. aureus. inhibition was most effective at 10 or 15 c, less so at 20 or 25 c, and least at 30 or 37 c, whereas stimulation during early growth was greater at the higher temperatures. results with different strains of the effectors and with two strains of s. aureus were similar, for the most part.
